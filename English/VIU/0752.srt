1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:04,652
After all the fuss over finding the owner of the calico cat, Tai

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:07,877
we decide to visit Mr. Masuko

3
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,877
who turned out to be Tai's real owner.

4
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:17,177
What's with this cat?

5
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:18,877
Sir! Is anything wrong?

6
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:23,377
Well, although this cat doesn't seem to be hurt,

7
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,177
it's got blood on its paws.

8
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,277
Which means...

9
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:27,977
Don't tell me that Mr. Masuko's...

10
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:30,377
Don't tell me...

11
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:36,677
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

12
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:38,477
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

13
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:40,177
The Detective Squad and locked room trick.

14
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,077
What is the cute calico cat's secret?

15
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,577
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,477
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,777
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:33,685
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,785
Mr. Masuko?

20
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:37,685
Please answer me if you're okay!

21
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:38,985
Mr. Masuko!

22
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:43,285
Sonny, maybe he could just be sleeping?

23
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,885
After all, the door lock seems to be in use too.

24
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:49,285
But, you heard a strange sound, didn't you, sir?

25
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:50,785
Yes.

26
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,685
A loud sound like something hitting something.

27
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:59,485
Moreover, there's blood on the paws of Mr. Masuko's cat.

28
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,585
I'm sure something happened inside!

29
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,085
Ai, get an ambulance!

30
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,185
Okay!

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,285
Do you guys have a string or something?

32
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:11,585
Any tape or wire too?

33
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,585
I've got yarn!

34
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,985
I've got some Band-Aid.

35
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,985
I have a clip.

36
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:21,385
But, what do you intend to do with these things?

37
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:23,985
I'm going to open the door lock!

38
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:28,385
First I tie the string onto the U-shaped bar of the door lock,

39
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:32,885
then I fix the knot on to the tip of the bar with the Band-Aid.

40
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,785
I pull the string through the clip

41
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:38,485
and fix the clip onto the inside of the door,

42
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,185
all's set.

43
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,085
All I need to do next is close the door

44
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,085
then pull hard on the string.

45
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:46,585
It opened!

46
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,485
Where's your room, sir?

47
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,285
Over there.

48
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:52,285
Then...

49
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,885
the room closest to this room is...

50
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,385
the room to the left.

51
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,985
Hey, Conan?

52
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,285
The room beyond?

53
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:04,685
It's an accident.

54
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,185
He tried to change the florescent light

55
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,485
by standing the chair up on the bed,

56
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,785
then he lost his balance and hit his head on the side table.

57
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,885
I do that sometimes too.

58
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,785
But, on top of the bed is unstable and dangerous.

59
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,585
Please don't do something like that!

60
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:27,285
Because the mattress on your bed is expensive and fluffy!

61
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:31,085
How come you know, about Officer Sato's bed?

62
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,085
Have you ever slept there?

63
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,285
Well, no...

64
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:38,785
I want to sleep over at Officer Sato's place too!

65
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,785
Never mind that,

66
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:45,385
but how is he, the owner of this room?

67
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,985
The surgery's over, but it seems he's unconscious

68
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,185
and in critical condition.

69
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,885
Well, if he regains consciousness,

70
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,585
he'll be grateful to you!

71
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,685
Because thanks to Conan who opened the door lock right away

72
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,985
his life was saved!

73
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,885
No, more than that...

74
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:03,185
if he comes to, I think he'll tell you...

75
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:06,485
who attacked him.

76
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:07,885
Attacked?

77
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,485
Isn't this an accident?

78
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:14,185
But, the chair's on top of the covers!

79
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,185
If he were going to stand the chair on the bed,

80
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,085
don't you think he'd have at least flipped the covers over?

81
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,585
Besides, see...

82
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:24,185
Mr. Masuko's still wearing a slipper on one leg!

83
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,185
If he were going to climb on the bed or a chair,

84
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,385
I think he'd take off his slippers, no?

85
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,285
I guess so...

86
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:33,385
Besides, I think the florescent light that he removed

87
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:37,585
was an old one that he was planning replace...

88
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:40,085
But the edges aren't black at all, right?

89
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,585
They look almost brand new.

90
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:46,785
Which means that someone knocked Mr. Masuko

91
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,085
over in this bedroom, hurt him badly,

92
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:52,485
and set things up to make it look like an accident.

93
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,085
From the time the next door neighbor heard a strange sound

94
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,585
to the time the manager came to this room,

95
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,985
it seems to have taken an hour.

96
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,585
Which means, there would've been enough time

97
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,585
to set up the trick.

98
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,185
But...

99
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,985
there seems to be only one spare key to the front door,

100
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:12,485
and both were found on the shelf of the living room.

101
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:15,785
Moreover, the door lock of the front door, how on earth...

102
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,185
That's all done with!

103
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,085
Right, Conan?

104
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,585
Since the door lock could be unlocked from outside,

105
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,285
to lock it would be even.

106
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,785
Oh, no. I haven't figured it out till there yet.

107
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,985
Hey, look!

108
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,585
An image here.

109
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,585
True!

110
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,085
Hey, you guys? What're you doing?

111
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,285
The door phone!

112
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:46,385
It seems to record the images of anybody who pushes it.

113
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,885
There is it!

114
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:52,185
Three people are shown on it an hour before we got here.

115
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,185
Even the sound is recorded,

116
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,585
and since they all gave their names

117
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,385
if you compare it with the address,

118
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,785
you may be able to find out who and where they're from, no?

119
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:04,885
There's no time for you two to be lovey-dovey!

120
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:07,585
Gee, it's because you said something you didn't have to, Officer Takagi!

121
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,685
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:13,985
On the table here are wrapping paper and an old cat carry.

123
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,185
He was really planning to give that calico cat away

124
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,585
to someone as a gift.

125
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,485
There are folding marks and ripped places here

126
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:24,485
and there on the wrapping paper, which means...

127
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,685
Did someone open what was already wrapped once?

128
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,385
The tape and scissors are here...

129
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,785
but the wastebasket nearby is empty.

130
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,285
Why that think isn't it here?

131
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,785
We found them quite quickly, didn't we?

132
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,185
The three who were shown on the door phone.

133
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:49,185
Yes. But the only one who was invited in

134
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,285
was the one who came first.

135
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,185
The second one was only answered at the door

136
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:58,385
and the third one says he rang the doorbell at the front entrance

137
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:01,885
but got no answer so left.

138
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,685
All three are suspicious.

139
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,085
True.

140
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,185
If the second one came while the first one was in the room,

141
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,485
if after the second guest went home,

142
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:15,185
the first one would've been able to commit the crime too.

143
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,285
Come to think of it,

144
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:19,385
when you guys rang the door phone at the entrance,

145
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,585
how was Mr. Masuko?

146
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,985
We didn't ring it!

147
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,885
We thought of ringing it

148
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:27,185
but a resident who was on his way out came,

149
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:29,885
so we went inside as he opened the door.

150
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,585
We wanted to surprise him by showing up without telling him!

151
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,085
We did have an appointment with him anyway too.

152
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,385
We also knew his room number besides.

153
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,385
I see.

154
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:45,485
"Furuyo Tsuyuguchi (41)" -Yes. It's true that I met Masuko today

155
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,985
"Bar Owner" -and had black tea in his living room.

156
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:51,485
I stayed until one song completed playing,

157
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,585
so I think I stayed about 10 minutes.

158
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:54,885
Record?

159
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:55,885
Yes.

160
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:00,285
I'm collecting vintage jazz records

161
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,185
and since Mr. Masuko told me

162
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,485
that he found the record that I was looking for,

163
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,185
I came and while I was at it,

164
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,585
he let me listen to one song!

165
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:13,285
Did the door bell ring while you were here?

166
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:17,085
I wonder because I was using headphones.

167
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:18,185
I'm sorry,

168
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:20,385
but may I be excused to go to the restroom?

169
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,485
Yes, go ahead.

170
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:23,585
Thank you.

171
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,385
Hey, sonny?

172
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,985
Why don't you turn off the light after using the restroom?

173
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,985
I'm sorry!

174
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,785
I can't stand wasting money, so I...

175
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,285
"Masuko" -Like I said before...

176
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,985
I only talked to him at the front door,

177
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,285
"Mari Aso (28), Former employee" -so I didn't go into the room.

178
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,885
I didn't have an appointment to see him either.

179
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:02,085
It seemed that he had a guest.

180
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,485
What did you want with Mr. Masuko?

181
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:09,485
The fact is I was fired from President Masuko's company.

182
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:12,285
So, I came to tell him goodbye.

183
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,785
Are you saying that you came to complain?

184
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:16,885
No, to the contrary!

185
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:20,485
I was fired because I really goofed things up.

186
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:25,285
Besides, the president found me new employment,

187
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:28,985
so I wanted to thank him for that too.

188
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,985
How cute.

189
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,485
May I carry him?

190
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:33,485
Yes!

191
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,285
Cute.

192
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,985
Tai is happily wagging his tail!

193
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,885
My, true.

194
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,785
Do you own a cat or something?

195
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:46,785
No, my parents don't like animals,

196
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:49,185
I like them, though.

197
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,685
Don't make me repeat myself.

198
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:55,085
"Rinpei Urushiya (53)" -It's true that I went to the front door.

199
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,985
"Novelist" -But no matter how many times I pushed the door bell,

200
00:10:56,985 --> 00:11:01,585
he didn't answer so I gave up and left!

201
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:04,185
Then, how did you get into the condo?

202
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,985
When I pushed the door phone on the 1st floor,

203
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,785
he opened it for me!

204
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:09,985
I'm not sure if it was him or not

205
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,985
because it's not that he said anything.

206
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:16,185
What's your relationship with Mr. Masuko?

207
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:19,185
I used to know him since my university days.

208
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:22,285
We're novelists that debuted in the same year.

209
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:25,185
Well, his novels didn't sell at all,

210
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,185
so it seems he gave up at an early stage, though.

211
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:31,785
As for myself, my novels only sold during the first stages too.

212
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:34,085
Thinking back now, I guess he who chose

213
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:36,585
another way of life did the right thing.

214
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:38,385
And, what brought you here?

215
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,285
I came so that we could think up some idea for a novel.

216
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,685
He used to keep me company

217
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,685
every time I got stuck from before.

218
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:50,585
Get that cat away from me.

219
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,785
How annoying.

220
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:54,085
You don't like cats, sir?

221
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,185
Yes.

222
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:58,285
I was scratched by a stray in the neighborhood this morning too.

223
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,685
I've got Band-Aid.

224
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,585
No need to worry!

225
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,185
I've finished treating it already.

226
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,885
Thank you.

227
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:11,985
Well, if this cat were like the cats in those famous novels,

228
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:15,485
a great detective cat it would be a different story, though.

229
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,885
The order in which they pushed the door phone

230
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:26,085
was Mrs. Tsuyuguchi, Miss Aso and Mr. Urushiya, that's okay.

231
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:27,885
But, since the neighbor's not sure

232
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,985
what time he heard the strange sound,

233
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,485
it's tough to narrow down the suspects.

234
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,985
I guess we've no other choice but to wait

235
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,085
for Mr. Masuko to regain consciousness.

236
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:40,385
No, I don't think we need to.

237
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,685
See.

238
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,485
It's that mischievous look.

239
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,669
And?

240
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:59,969
Those three are the people who came

241
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:03,769
around the time the neighbor heard the suspicious noise?

242
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,769
Yes.

243
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,269
But...

244
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,569
The door was locked and bolted, wasn't it?

245
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:13,269
Do we really have a case here?

246
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:14,369
Yes, sir.

247
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,869
The crime scene indicates that it's not an accident

248
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,569
according to Conan.

249
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,769
And, is Conan in the room?

250
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,769
No. He left saying he had some shopping to do.

251
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:25,869
I'm back!

252
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,769
Conan!

253
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,269
What did you buy?

254
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,569
The thing that was missing from Mr. Masuko's room!

255
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,269
The thing that was missing?

256
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:37,069
This!

257
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,769
A ribbon for wrapping!

258
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,269
After wrapping the present,

259
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,969
you usually cut off the edges of the ribbon with scissors.

260
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:47,669
Since there were no cut pieces of ribbon in the trash box,

261
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,469
though there was a scissors,

262
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:52,869
I think that the length of the ribbon happened to be just right.

263
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:55,669
The content was an old cat carry

264
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,169
and besides tape was also there.

265
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,169
So, I'm sure Mr. Masuko wrapped himself and not at a store.

266
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:05,369
But... What does that tell us?

267
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,769
Are you half-asleep?

268
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,769
The fact that it's gone

269
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,069
means that the perp used it for something.

270
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,769
Half-asleep?

271
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,869
For example, to lock the room

272
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,769
and make it look like an accident.

273
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,769
At any rate, let's try it out and see

274
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,669
whether it can really be done or not.

275
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,769
First, how the safety lock was latched!

276
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,869
Pass the ribbon between the space of the door

277
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,369
and the bolt so it hooks on

278
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,869
then go outside holding onto both ends of the ribbon

279
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:39,969
and close the door.

280
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:43,369
All you have to do next is pull on both ends of the ribbon.

281
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:44,769
Okay, Mitsuhiko!

282
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,069
Roger.

283
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,469
-Start pulling! -Okay.

284
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,869
It... it worked!

285
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:57,269
Next, locking the door.

286
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,869
Open the door

287
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,769
and after checking if it's bolted.

288
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,369
Pull the ribbon off

289
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,469
and make a knot in the middle of it.

290
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,669
I've made a knot.

291
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,869
Then looped the ribbon around the knob,

292
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:14,269
to lock the door, so that the knot hooks on

293
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,869
pull the end of the ribbon outside and close the door.

294
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:21,169
Then, pull it diagonally upwards from outside.

295
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:24,769
Amazing.

296
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,669
The ribbon really locked the door.

297
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:29,869
But unlike the safety lock,

298
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:31,869
you can pull the ribbon out this time, can you?

299
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:34,769
Hey! Pull with all your might!

300
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,169
Okay.

301
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,269
But the door is closed

302
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,269
and the knot is blocking it from pulling off.

303
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,569
Strange, it was supposed to work.

304
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,469
I guess he's just a kid after all.

305
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:52,169
When you got here, the ribbon wasn't here, was it?

306
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,769
-No. -There was nothing here.

307
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,769
Then it's impossible to lock this door using this ribbon.

308
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,569
Yes. The ribbon would be left behind

309
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:05,169
unless someone pulls it off from inside the room

310
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,769
and takes it somewhere, then it would work.

311
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,469
Someone? But only the victim was in the room.

312
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,769
And he's still unconscious, you know?

313
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,569
I've got no choice...

314
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,369
See, over there.

315
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,069
Good luck!

316
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,269
Keep moving the ribbon!

317
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,269
Okay.

318
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,869
The cat pulled it along in its mouth and took it away!

319
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,069
After it!

320
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,169
Yes, sir!

321
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,769
Inside the bookshelf?

322
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:49,269
So this is where the cat hides his treasures.

323
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,769
I found it!

324
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,569
A different ribbon from the one just now!

325
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,369
It's knotted too,

326
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,169
so there's no mistake about it.

327
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,469
The question is...

328
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,569
who set up the trick with that ribbon?

329
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,569
I think it's the doing of someone who's good with cats.

330
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,769
Yes. Someone who knows that cat well enough

331
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,169
to the point of knowing it not only takes the ribbon away

332
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,669
but also knows that it hides it somewhere.

333
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,469
Then, it could be the lady wearing glasses?

334
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:23,869
Because Tai was wagging his tail

335
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,269
when she carried him.

336
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,069
No, unlike dogs,

337
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,069
cats wag their tails when they don't like something.

338
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,869
Since Ms. Aso didn't know this,

339
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,869
I don't think she knew much about cats, no?

340
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,869
But, maybe the cat didn't like her

341
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,269
because she hurt his owner?

342
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,669
If so, she wouldn't ask if she could hold him from her side!

343
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,469
There's a possibility that he might scratch her too.

344
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,469
But, the other two were...

345
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:51,069
Mrs. Tsuyuguchi, who was hung up on saving electricity

346
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,569
and Mr. Urushiya, who picked up the stuff

347
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:56,669
that Genta dropped out of his pocket.

348
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,369
Both were habitual, unconscious acts, no?

349
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:01,569
Right.

350
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:05,069
But, back then Genta dropped a Band-Aid,

351
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,369
a handkerchief and the cap of a PET bottle,

352
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:09,869
but the thing that Mr. Urushiya picked

353
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,869
was the PET bottle cap, right?

354
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:14,569
Now that you mentioned it, right...

355
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,269
But why?

356
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,269
Shall we try it out then? Take a look.

357
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,169
I see! Cats love PET bottle caps too!

358
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,369
I see.

359
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:31,769
If the cat takes it

360
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,069
and brings it to the place he hides his treasures

361
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:37,869
there's a danger that the ribbon that was used for the trick

362
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,469
would be found.

363
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,669
Well, it seems to have been an unpremeditated crime

364
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,569
because the perp used things that were at the site.

365
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,669
If the perp wasn't wearing gloves,

366
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,269
prints could probably be taken from the ribbon.

367
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:53,869
Okay, let's interrogate Mr. Urushiya once more!

368
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:58,269
When did you start suspecting that the novelist?

369
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:02,769
Was it because Tai stood his tail up to him?

370
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,669
Because it's what cats do when they are happy,

371
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,369
want love or to people who they know well.

372
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,369
Well, true, but I've suspect him being the perp

373
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:16,269
from the time he said someone opened the door for him

374
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,369
when he rang the door phone on the ground floor.

375
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:22,169
If it were the perp who opened the door,

376
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,469
he would've still been inside the room.

377
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:29,669
It's unthinkable that the perp would let someone up to the front door

378
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,569
if he were planning to set up the locked room scheme then.

379
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,969
Indeed.

380
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:42,469
I'm the one who knocked him over and seriously hurt him.

381
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,169
But, it's amazing how you thought up something like that

382
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:45,569
on the spur of a moment.

383
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:49,269
I used to write that sort of mysteries novels in the past.

384
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:53,269
The fact is, I came to ask him for money today.

385
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,369
I was actually supposed to meet him tomorrow, though.

386
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,969
But, he called me this morning to tell me

387
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,769
that he had something good to give me.

388
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,269
I got impatient and came to see him today.

389
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,669
But, all he gave me was a messily wrapped used cat carry!

390
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,869
Furthermore, inside it was that calico cat!

391
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,169
Moreover, he said that he couldn't give it to me yet today.

392
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,469
He grinned and kept me in suspense.

393
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:27,769
To begin with, that cat was a stray that I brought home with me too.

394
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,569
Which means that you were the original owner?

395
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,669
Yes, when it was a kitten for only about 6 months.

396
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:37,569
I gave it to him because his wife was depressed

397
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,069
going through pet loss.

398
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,769
Well, I was glad I gave it to them, though.

399
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,769
Because after that my novels stopped selling completely,

400
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,869
and I couldn't afford to be taking care of a cat.

401
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:52,269
It seems that in turn, his company started doing really well.

402
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,469
Yet, how dare he try to push that stray cat back to me.

403
00:20:57,469 --> 00:21:00,769
Right. Carrying the cat that went

404
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:03,369
into the bedroom with the ribbon,

405
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,469
here's what he said...

406
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:08,069
This cat will help you work everything out!

407
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,669
Moreover, he's was yours to begin with.

408
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,669
You're more fit to be his owner.

409
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:18,869
But, Tai is an incredible cat, you know.

410
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,769
Male calico cats are rare in number

411
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,469
and super valuable.

412
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:24,569
They're really expensive!

413
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,269
What?

414
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:32,469
But, Mr. Masuko didn't return the cat to you for the money.

415
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,769
I think he did so because that cat

416
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,769
was a cat that brought on good fortune, a lucky cat.

417
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:04,069
I'm glad because Tai's owner was discharged from the hospital, right?

418
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:06,669
Yes, he has no after effects from the injury either.

419
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,269
And what happened to the cat?

420
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,069
It turned out that Azusa of Poirot would keep him after all.

421
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,569
Tai?

422
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,969
No joke? You turned into a stray again?

423
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:22,169
But, it looks smaller?

424
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:24,569
The pattern looks exactly the same, though.

425
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,969
Come on! We're going home, Mugi!

426
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:31,069
Come on, grandma.

427
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,669
You've got to keep the lid of the cat closed!

428
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,869
I'm sorry, but she looked uncomfortable.

429
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:39,769
I think that granny was...

430
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,569
All's well ends well.

431
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:45,569
Is it okay?

432
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,369
I'm a Peeping Tom, you know.

433
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,469
Were you still here, Mr. Suzuki?

434
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:54,369
The landlord told you to leave as soon as possible, right?

435
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,669
Hey! We've got company.

436
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,069
Please cut it out already, Katsuko.

437
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:04,369
Inside... Katsuko's...

438
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,069
Next Conan,

439
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:12,869
"Share House Blind Spot".
