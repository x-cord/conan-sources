1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:05,877
The Youth Detective Squad met a woman named Saki Midorikawa.

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:08,677
"Saki Midorikawa (28)" -She helped Ayumi when she tripped

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:11,177
and hurt herself.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,977
We thought Ms. Saki was a kind, good-natured person,

5
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,977
but shortly afterwards, we noticed something strange.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,177
There were three people glaring at her.

7
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:25,577
Women's university professor, Mr. Junnosuke Tachibana,

8
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:28,177
officer worker, Ms. Michiyo Konno

9
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:31,077
and social critic, Ms. Tatsuko Dojima.

10
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,077
And then...

11
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:36,777
Ms. Dojima, did you find what you were looking for?

12
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:41,377
No. I thought I dropped it around here.

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,077
In my eyes are maximum creation.

14
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,677
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

15
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,277
A beautiful woman falls from a building.

16
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:06,177
What are the three mysteries connected to her window?

17
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:07,677
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:09,477
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,877
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:58,632
"The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 2)"

21
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,148
Looks like she fell to her death.

22
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:08,048
Yeah.

23
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:11,148
Did she fall from the roof?

24
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,848
I knew it.

25
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,748
Ma'am!

26
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,348
You were at the intersection yesterday, right?

27
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:21,848
What did you know?

28
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,448
"Naka Nakabayashi (73)" -The same thing happened to her yesterday.

29
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,848
Miss!

30
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,748
What happened?

31
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:49,448
Did someone push her?

32
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:54,248
So she was nearly killed yesterday too.

33
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:57,148
Who pushed her?

34
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,748
I don't know!

35
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,848
Don't bring me into this!

36
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:08,248
Sounds like Ms. Saki may have been murdered.

37
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,548
The culprit came back to finish her off.

38
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:14,248
But who and why?

39
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:16,648
Those three...

40
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,948
They're suspicious.

41
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:23,548
Indeed.

42
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:27,148
Ms. Saki hid the attempt on her life.

43
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:28,248
It would've been natural for her

44
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,248
to report it to the police.

45
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:33,548
Which means there was some reason she couldn't.

46
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,048
But what would that be?

47
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,448
We don't know that yet.

48
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,748
-Please clear a path. -Stand back, please.

49
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:43,948
Excuse me.

50
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:46,948
Hello, sir.

51
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,948
I told you

52
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:52,648
I was just looking for a ring I happened to drop.

53
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,648
That's when...

54
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,648
She came crashing down right before my eyes!

55
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,948
She was here at the time of the incident.

56
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,648
Apparently.

57
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:14,748
The deceased is Saki Midorikawa, 28 years old.

58
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,548
She lived in an apartment across the street.

59
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:23,148
She worked as a dancer as at a pub on Sanchome.

60
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:27,348
So she was a dancer.

61
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,748
Someone fell to their death?

62
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:33,748
"Towa Akabane (26)" -So scary. How ominous.

63
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:36,548
She seems to live here too.

64
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:40,048
Yeah. It looked like she was returning from a trip.

65
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,348
Excuse me.

66
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:42,848
Can I leave now?

67
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,948
I'm feeling dizzy.

68
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,748
Very well.

69
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,448
Goodbye, then.

70
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,948
Why did she kill herself?

71
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:55,548
I know, right?

72
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,948
Officer Takagi, about Ms. Saki Midorikawa...

73
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,048
You kids are here?

74
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,348
Inspector Megure,

75
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:07,848
the victim seems to have fallen from the roof.

76
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,948
There were scratch marks on the railing on the roof.

77
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,548
We also found a woman's earring on the ground.

78
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,448
They match.

79
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:21,148
The building's security cameras also captured

80
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,248
the victim heading to the roof.

81
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,148
Was Ms. Saki wearing gloves then?

82
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,848
-What? -No, she wasn't.

83
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,848
I see.

84
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:37,748
The victim took the elevator to the 11th floor and got off there.

85
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:42,448
The stairs have to be taken to reach the roof

86
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:46,548
but she didn't fall until an hour later.

87
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:49,348
Then there's her phone.

88
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:52,948
Her last incoming call was from a nearby payphone.

89
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,848
She came to this building shortly after receiving it.

90
00:06:56,848 --> 00:07:01,648
Which means the person who called invited her up to a roof

91
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,648
where they got into a fight.

92
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,348
So it's possible she was pushed.

93
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,048
Yes.

94
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,448
Excuse me.

95
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,148
Yes.

96
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:19,648
Yes, I see.

97
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,048
Got it.

98
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,348
According to the victim's colleagues,

99
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,148
she used to be a good-natured woman well-liked by everyone.

100
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,248
I knew it!

101
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,948
But for whatever reason,

102
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:34,848
her personality suddenly changed about three years ago.

103
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:38,448
She started extorting coworkers and customers.

104
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,648
People didn't think highly of her.

105
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:46,148
I see. I'm going to watch the autopsy.

106
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:50,248
You two question the people she was extorting.

107
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,248
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

108
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:54,248
We'll start with her coworkers.

109
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,648
Hey, Officer Takagi.

110
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,348
A car almost struck Ms. Saki at an intersection yesterday.

111
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,548
What? What do you mean?

112
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:08,448
And there are three people who have been glaring at Ms. Saki.

113
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,848
We should talk to those three.

114
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:20,248
Yeah, although Ms. Dojima has an alibi.

115
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:23,448
I don't know anything about her.

116
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:26,448
She saw you doing something unsavory

117
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:27,848
from that window, didn't she?

118
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:35,148
And she was blackmailing you with it, right, Mr. Tachibana?

119
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,648
I did receive a threatening letter yesterday.

120
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,948
Could we take a look at it?

121
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,748
"I saw it all. I'll tell."

122
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:46,948
"Don't bother contacting the police."

123
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,448
"The woman who knows your secret."

124
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:54,348
So you hastily attempted to silence her yesterday

125
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,348
but when you failed, you tried again today.

126
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:00,748
No! I was here in my apartment when she fell!

127
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,348
And I have an alibi for yesterday.

128
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:04,648
If my students find out,

129
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:08,248
my popularity with them will be over.

130
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,448
He's innocent as far as the attempted murder goes.

131
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:15,448
Over? What did she see?

132
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,648
You're still under suspicion for the murder.

133
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:26,448
I took this off without thinking.

134
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:32,848
It's so hot...

135
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,048
This moment never gets old.

136
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,248
She saw me...

137
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,848
But I didn't kill her!

138
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,948
Let's withhold judgment

139
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,248
until we talk to Michiyo Konno the office worker.

140
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,048
This arrived today.

141
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:05,148
It's the same as Mr. Tachibana's.

142
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:06,248
Yeah.

143
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,248
But I'd never do that.

144
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:11,848
I was here when that woman died.

145
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,648
After all, Ms. Saki called me and told me to stay here.

146
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,548
Ms. Saki called you?

147
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,648
What did she say?

148
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:19,948
I suppose it can't be helped.

149
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:23,148
It's better than being framed for murder.

150
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:24,548
Wait in your apartment.

151
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,448
We need to talk...

152
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:30,848
about how you tried to silence me yesterday.

153
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,848
She knows!

154
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:32,948
Then...

155
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,148
That's right. If she told anyone...

156
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,148
What did she see you doing?

157
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:42,748
I heard a wealthy man was looking for a love child he conceived

158
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,048
a long time ago.

159
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,848
I disguised myself as Michiyo Konno

160
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:49,048
in order to blackmail him, but...

161
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,248
A bulge...

162
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:54,148
-She's flat. -She's flat.

163
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:58,248
Yeah. My real name is Daihachi Numagaki.

164
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,548
"Daihachi Numagaki (32)" -I'm a man.

165
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:06,948
"Driver's License. Daihachi Numagaki" -And she saw me.

166
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:12,548
Nothing beats this.

167
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,248
Being a woman is so restricting.

168
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,748
She even sent me that letter.

169
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:29,748
-I didn't do it! -We're arresting him

170
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:32,048
-Hold up! -for attempted murder and fraud.

171
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:33,348
-Hey, wait! -What?

172
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,148
They found sedatives in the body?

173
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:39,448
So you drugged her with sedatives before you pushed her.

174
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,348
I told you I was in my apartment!

175
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,748
So it was him.

176
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:47,748
But that letter and phone call were clearly...

177
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,848
I see.

178
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:52,948
She might've seen their secrets while I was over.

179
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,948
After all, she said...

180
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:59,148
So they have a friend over.

181
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,348
A friend?

182
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,048
Maybe she thought he was someone else

183
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,048
since he looked different from usual.

184
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,048
No, wait. That's...

185
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,948
I'm the one who called the police!

186
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,748
I live in unit 202! My name is Akabane!

187
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,348
I'd been traveling since the day before yesterday

188
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:19,848
and when I returned, all my jewels had vanished!

189
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,748
Sounds like she was robbed.

190
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,348
We saw her this morning. Come think of it...

191
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:28,148
So scary. How ominous.

192
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,248
And unit 202...

193
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,448
Then the friend Ms. Saki saw was...

194
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,248
Conan!

195
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:47,848
We can see it.

196
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,548
It's certainly possible.

197
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,948
So she saw the thief.

198
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:55,048
But isn't that unrelated to the murder?

199
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:58,648
Numagaki's the one who killed her.

200
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:01,848
But we still don't know...

201
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:05,248
Anyway, she lived rather frugally

202
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,048
for someone blackmailing people.

203
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,048
Maybe that's her boyfriend.

204
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:17,448
Excuse me, ma'am.

205
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,948
His name was Ryo Suenaga.

206
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,848
They lived here together.

207
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:26,448
But he suddenly moved out.

208
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:31,948
He forced his shady debts onto Saki.

209
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,248
That was three autumns ago.

210
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,448
-Wait a minute! -She started extorting people

211
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,748
to pay off his debts?

212
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:42,848
And she was living frugally because of it.

213
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:47,948
"Hiroe Omori (60), Landlady" -Saki must have really loved Suenaga.

214
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,048
She waited for him,

215
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,848
believing he'd someday return.

216
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,948
It sounds like she often looked out her window,

217
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,148
but was that...

218
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,248
Saki, you're soaked.

219
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:07,748
I thought I saw him from the window.

220
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:12,348
She started sitting in her window after that.

221
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:17,148
She was waiting for him for three whole years.

222
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,248
Did you tell anyone that Ms. Saki was waiting

223
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,248
for Mr. Suenaga to return?

224
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:26,248
Yes, I told that detective woman last night.

225
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:29,548
She asked me to tell her all about it

226
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,448
since her investigation was very important to Saki.

227
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,448
I've got it.

228
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,748
It even explains how that person got Ms. Saki

229
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,048
to come to the crime scene.

230
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,148
That person?

231
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:42,248
The woman who killed Ms. Saki.

232
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,348
Tatsuko Dojima.

233
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:47,248
What? But she has an alibi.

234
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:59,315
She was on the ground when Ms. Saki fell.

235
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,515
And of course, not by coincidence.

236
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:06,315
I know that her apartment, unit 1107, is directly above here

237
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:07,715
and the trick she used.

238
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,115
Could it be?

239
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:19,315
The woman in unit 202 lost her key about a week ago.

240
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:23,215
Apparently the key was turned in to the building manager.

241
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,915
She must've made a spare key then.

242
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:30,115
Ms. Dojima received the offer to be a regular guest on a TV show

243
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,815
yesterday afternoon.

244
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,515
Looks like that's after the theft occurred.

245
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:37,015
That's why she needed to silence her.

246
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,015
Is she meeting with the TV station staff?

247
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:44,715
Hey, Officer Takagi.

248
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:56,615
Conan!

249
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:06,515
There's only signs of water on this side.

250
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,715
So that's how she did it.

251
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:10,615
That's why she used gloves and sedatives.

252
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:21,215
Is it possible that she...

253
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,115
She must've bought them in a hurry.

254
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,015
It sounds like you've figured it all out.

255
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:35,315
But I need your help now.

256
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:40,015
What do you mean you want my advice?

257
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:44,015
Apparently Ms. Saki Midorikawa was murdered

258
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,015
but there are some things us, The Youth Detective Squad,

259
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:48,015
can't figure out.

260
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:50,715
Since you're such a great social critic,

261
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:54,015
we thought we could use your advice.

262
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,515
Fine, then. Well?

263
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,015
When she died, Ms. Saki was wearing gloves.

264
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:01,715
I wonder why.

265
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,315
To protect her hands from UV rays, right?

266
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,215
It's possible the culprit put them on her.

267
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:11,515
Why would they do that to push her off a roof?

268
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:15,015
Because she didn't come to the roof.

269
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,815
That's why the culprit put the gloves on her.

270
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,515
They needed it to make sense that

271
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:24,915
Ms. Saki's fingerprints weren't on the door to the roof.

272
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:31,515
After exiting the elevator on the 11th floor,

273
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:35,615
she visited you in unit 1107.

274
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,815
Hey, listen...

275
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:40,615
Why don't you wait until we're finished to respond?

276
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:42,315
On a whim,

277
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,015
you made a spare of the key you found

278
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:48,315
and robbed unit 202.

279
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:49,515
And then...

280
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:52,915
Ms. Saki saw you.

281
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,315
She saw me!

282
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,715
That can't be good.

283
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:58,315
Your theft would surely be discovered

284
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:01,115
and even if Ms. Saki's memory was hazy,

285
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,815
if you started appearing on TV, she was sure to notice.

286
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,615
In a hurry to silence her,

287
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:12,515
you noticed there were others who didn't like Ms. Saki.

288
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:17,215
You realized she'd seen their secrets too.

289
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:23,415
And you used that against them!

290
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,415
Impersonating Ms. Saki,

291
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,015
you delivered the letters so they would silence her.

292
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:33,615
And Mr. Numagaki fell for it.

293
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,915
But he failed

294
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,715
and Ms. Saki hid the attempt on her life.

295
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,415
I was thinking

296
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:43,615
and accidentally tried to cross when it was red.

297
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,115
Since she knew she'd incurred the ire of others,

298
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:49,715
she thought that's what it was.

299
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:54,515
Next you plotted to frame Mr. Numagaki.

300
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,615
You impersonated Ms. Saki and called Mr. Numagaki on the phone

301
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,515
so he wouldn't have an alibi.

302
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,415
Wait in your apartment.

303
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,315
We need to talk...

304
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:07,915
Then you invited Ms. Saki to your own apartment.

305
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:12,115
You used the information you got from the landlady the night before

306
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:17,615
and lied about having information about Mr. Suenaga.

307
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,815
Ms. Saki gleefully ran over

308
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,715
and you put her to sleep using sedatives.

309
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:28,315
You made it look like she was pushed from the roof.

310
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,815
You placed Ms. Saki on the platform

311
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:38,715
made from the materials and ice you bought last night.

312
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:55,115
Then you pretended to look for a lost item on the ground

313
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:58,915
and waited for the ice to melt and Ms. Saki to fall.

314
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,715
That gave you an alibi

315
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:10,215
and nobody noticed the contraption on your balcony

316
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,515
because of the balloons you used to hide her.

317
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,215
This is ridiculous.

318
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,515
It's all just conjecture.

319
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,315
You don't have a single piece of evidence.

320
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:23,915
One of the balloons was missing from its string.

321
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:27,115
There was a thin scratch on Ms. Saki's neck.

322
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:31,115
I thought maybe got caught on it when she fell.

323
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:34,715
So we searched for the balloon together.

324
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:39,715
You kids were right about this.

325
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:43,215
The abrasion on Ms. Saki Midorikawa's neck

326
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:46,415
and the shape of the string were a perfect match.

327
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:49,915
And we found fingerprints matching the ones on your lease

328
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,715
on the balloon.

329
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:58,615
A single balloon isn't evidence!

330
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:03,615
But that connects you to the deceased Ms. Saki.

331
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,615
The police can search your apartment now.

332
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,915
I'm sure they'll find all kinds of things.

333
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:16,915
The woman in unit 202 was an eyesore!

334
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:20,315
Despite being so stupid, she wore all those jewels!

335
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:24,615
I swiped them because she needed to be brought down a peg!

336
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,215
But she...

337
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:31,715
Have we met recently?

338
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:35,715
It's her fault for witnessing it.

339
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,515
Once the robbery was discovered,

340
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:42,715
Ms. Saki might have blackmailed you.

341
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:46,315
That woman was evil!

342
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:50,615
Being evil doesn't give you the right to kill her!

343
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:53,615
She was also a kind person,

344
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:58,215
waiting for her beloved to return.

345
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:27,615
Be careful, Genta.

346
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,615
Someone might be watching you.

347
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,315
You'd better be careful.

348
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:37,015
I bet Conan's got way more to hide than me.

349
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,515
Don't redirect the question at me!

350
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,615
Wow, he's right.

351
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:45,715
"Episode Preview" -We accompanied Pops to Kokura, Fukuoka,

352
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,815
for the Japanese Detective League's award ceremony

353
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:51,115
so he could accept his Best Detective Award.

354
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,415
He was hospitalized for an injury?

355
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,615
He hit his head when he fell.

356
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:58,815
He's still unconscious.

357
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:02,915
Could we keep what I'm about to tell you between us?

358
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:05,615
Sorry but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

359
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:06,615
What?

360
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,615
Next Conan,

361
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,615
