1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:04,506
Don't tell me that the couple...

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,206
If they were Bourbon and Bellmot...

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,706
If they heard the conversation I had with Jodie...

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:15,506
At any rate, I have to hurry and meet Ai and confirm.

5
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:19,006
Darn! Why didn't I notice right away?

6
00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:25,106
If she said that her husband, Tohei, was also a hostage back then,

7
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:28,106
nothing fits into place.

8
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:31,306
After goofing things up like that...

9
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,206
Goofing things up?

10
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:39,406
This is maybe a trap!

11
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:45,006
You're asking if I haven't been sensing the organization lately?

12
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,506
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:50,006
I mean, you used to say that you smelled something before, didn't you?

14
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,906
I haven't been sensing them.

15
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,906
But I wasn't working my antennas out for them either.

16
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:57,906
You also told me that the organization already thinks I'm dead.

17
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:01,406
I see. I guess it's okay then.

18
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:05,106
What? Don't tell me that they found out that I'm still alive?

19
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,906
I was just confirming, just confirming!

20
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:09,906
Sorry for calling you so late.

21
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,106
"Ai Haibara"

22
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,406
Keep cool, keep calm. That's the way to go.

23
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:33,906
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

24
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,806
are slashed by the light of deduction.

25
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,406
While investigating with Sera, Ran collapses to the floor.

26
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:39,506
What on earth has happened?

27
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,106
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:43,006
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:45,506
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,886
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 1)".

31
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,986
Hey, Conan.

32
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,989
Conan!

33
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:29,989
What is it?

34
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,789
What do you mean what?

35
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:33,789
All you've been doing for a while is looking around.

36
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,589
Is there anybody suspicious around?

37
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:37,989
Don't let it bother you.

38
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,589
It's nothing.

39
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:40,989
Really?

40
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,789
Shoots.

41
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:46,689
Ever since then, I keep feeling like someone's watching.

42
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,089
I already told Jodie that I thought that the couple

43
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:55,389
was a member of the organization of the men in black

44
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,389
but if they noticed what happened...

45
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,389
Cool it. Everything'll be fine.

46
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,689
Everything's still okay.

47
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,089
Are you feeling sick or something, Conan?

48
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,789
You're perspiring profusely.

49
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:17,989
I'm planning to eat lunch with Mom at Chinatown after this

50
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,989
but would you like to call it off and go home?

51
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,189
I'm fine!

52
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,089
I was just thinking of something.

53
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,589
Really?

54
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,189
I have this hard homework to figure out, you see.

55
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,989
The sound of a shutter?

56
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,589
I'm not just imagining things!

57
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,889
Just as I thought.

58
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,689
Somebody's watching me after all.

59
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,289
But, who on earth could it be?

60
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,389
Why?

61
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,689
Again! It's closer than before!

62
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:53,889
Where's it coming from?

63
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,389
Where's the picture being taken from?

64
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,289
Hey, hi you guys!

65
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,589
What're you doing in a place like this?

66
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,589
Masumi, what brings you here?

67
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,589
I'm here on work.

68
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,589
Do you know about a girl called Keiko Kitao that's in Class A next door?

69
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,789
You mean Kei?

70
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,489
I was introduced to her older sister by her.

71
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,989
And her older sister asked me to find something out for her.

72
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,789
See.

73
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,789
She's sitting in that chair over there.

74
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,689
"Rumi Kitao (21), University student" -Ms. Rumi Kitao,

75
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,489
a junior in university.

76
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,489
And the man sitting next to her is

77
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,889
"Kenya Settsu (22), University student" -Mr. Kenya Settsu,

78
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,289
a senior in university.

79
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,889
They've been going with each other from about six months ago, you see.

80
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,989
She wants to introduce him to her parents as her fiance,

81
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:42,289
but rumor has it that he's a playboy.

82
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,589
And besides, she suspects

83
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:46,589
that he hasn't broken off with his ex-girlfriend yet.

84
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,789
That's what I was checking!

85
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,389
So, she's doing a "is he having other affairs" check, huh?

86
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,589
And? How about it?

87
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,089
I guess you could say, things are gray for now.

88
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,489
It seems that he hasn't returned

89
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,489
the spare key to his ex-girlfriend's room yet.

90
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,989
This is his ex-girlfriend's condo too.

91
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:10,889
But is it okay for you to be telling us something like that?

92
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,589
Don't worry about it!

93
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,689
You guys aren't blabbermouths, are you?

94
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,589
And, by the way, what're you guys doing?

95
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,489
This is the Kanagawa prefecture, you know.

96
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:24,389
My mom's client who lives in this condo

97
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,589
is talking things over with her right now.

98
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,589
After she's finished with that,

99
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:30,189
we were supposed to go have a meal with her.

100
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,989
It's from Mom.

101
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,289
No joke, you mean you can't come?

102
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,989
But I'm already starved.

103
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:44,689
I'm sorry. The talk's going to take a while longer.

104
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,089
If you're hungry,

105
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,489
go ahead with Conan and get yourselves something to eat.

106
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:51,089
I'll meet you again at sundown in this lobby, okay?

107
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,589
Okay.

108
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,589
Maybe we should get some rice balls or something nearby.

109
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,289
Why don't you have them treat you guys to something then?

110
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,689
It seems that they're having a lunch date with his ex-girl today, you see.

111
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,589
You got to be kidding.

112
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,689
We've never even met them.

113
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,589
This is an undercover investigation, you know.

114
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,789
Undercover?

115
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,089
For the sake of Keiko of Class A.

116
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,789
No joke.

117
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:20,989
Isn't your younger sister coming later?

118
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:22,689
It was really difficult

119
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,789
to get a reservation for your younger sister

120
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,189
being that the restaurant is quite famous.

121
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,889
It can't be helped.

122
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,689
She said she suddenly had to attend to an urgent business of her friend.

123
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,789
What's this? Don't tell me you're going after my sister?

124
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,989
No! I just thought that with your younger sister around,

125
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,389
the atmosphere would be a bit more comfortable.

126
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,489
I mean, today,

127
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:44,589
we're eating together so that Waka and I can smooth things out, right?

128
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,589
I haven't talked to her since we broke up, you see.

129
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:49,889
I guess so.

130
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,889
I'm sure that Mr. Kaga who'll be coming later

131
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,489
will help keep the atmosphere exciting.

132
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,789
Excuse me.

133
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,489
Are you by chance, Kei's older sister?

134
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,389
Yes.

135
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,289
I'm Ran Mouri who used to be in the same class as her last year.

136
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,089
Since she's showed me a picture of you several time before,

137
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,089
I thought that you may be...

138
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,189
Oh, is that so?

139
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,989
What a coincidence.

140
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,389
The fact is,

141
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,389
I was supposed to join you for a meal in place of Keiko of Class A today.

142
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,189
If that man is a playboy as he's rumored to be,

143
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,989
I figured he'd sneakily try to give me the eye

144
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,889
when he thinks she's not watching.

145
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,689
But you've got a way better figure than me and you're also much cuter.

146
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:37,889
So, won't you please play the role for me?

147
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,589
If he's really that kind of guy,

148
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,689
I'm sure that he'll jump at the bait as soon as it's laid out before him.

149
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,389
Okay. I'll just sprinkle a bit of bait to begin with.

150
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,089
So...

151
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,089
Conan, I know you're hungry

152
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,189
but you haven't decided what you want to eat yet, have you?

153
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,189
No.

154
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,189
You're so obvious.

155
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,589
Why don't you come and eat with us then?

156
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,689
One child more is no big deal.

157
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,089
Thank you so very much.

158
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,889
Talk about an easy catch.

159
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,389
Good job.

160
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,589
Waka sure is late, isn't she?

161
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,589
It's after noon time already.

162
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,589
It can't be helped.

163
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,989
She was drinking till 05:00 this morning, you know.

164
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,089
"Mitsuaki Kaga (22), University student" -I'm sure she still sleeping.

165
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:36,789
There you are, Kaga!

166
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,289
Was there a restroom in this lobby?

167
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,289
Yeah. It's on the other side of the elevator.

168
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,989
I guess I'll go use the john then.

169
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:48,589
If so, I'll go see on Waka.

170
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,389
If you're going to Waka's room...

171
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,089
Can you give this spare key back to her?

172
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,489
I don't need it anymore, you see.

173
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,889
Kenya...

174
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,189
Hey, hey, don't drop it.

175
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,689
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,389
And, he's left all alone with Ran.

177
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,989
If he's going to reveal his real self,

178
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,589
this'll be the time.

179
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,689
Sorry, but can you go with her?

180
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,189
If Waka' not sober yet,

181
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,289
she may bite at Rumi, you see.

182
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,689
True.

183
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,889
I'm the one who took Waka's boyfriend.

184
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,489
If somebody who she doesn't know is with me,

185
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,889
maybe Waka will be a bit calmer.

186
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,789
I don't mind.

187
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,589
Okay, then please come with me.

188
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:41,889
Yes.

189
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,689
It could be that she just suddenly felt like not wanting to see me again

190
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:51,989
and is just cooped up in her room.

191
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,189
If so, won't you tell her that I'd like to see her personally

192
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,489
and apologize for a lot of things.

193
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,489
He's got more...

194
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:04,189
-common sense than I thought. -Common sense than I thought.

195
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,189
"Hashitani"

196
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,589
There's no answer.

197
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,189
I wonder if she's still sleeping after all.

198
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,289
Then, maybe I should use this.

199
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,789
Waka?

200
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,389
Are you asleep?

201
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,889
I'm sorry, it's a call.

202
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,389
I'm sorry, but can you go wake Waka up?

203
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,689
"Kenya Settsu"

204
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:41,089
When she comes home drunk,

205
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,389
Waka has a habit of sleeping in weird places, you see.

206
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,089
Please look inside the closet and other places too, okay?

207
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,589
Okay.

208
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,889
Sorry to keep you waiting.

209
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,689
Is the connection unclear?

210
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,789
I'll be out on the veranda, then.

211
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:00,489
Waka? Are you there?

212
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:01,589
Waka?

213
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,589
Waka?

214
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,189
What shall I do?

215
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,989
She's nowhere in sight.

216
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,489
The bathtub room?

217
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,789
I'm Rumi's younger sister's friend

218
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,689
and I was told to come and get you, Waka.

219
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,089
Waka?

220
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,889
Are you all right?

221
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,789
Waka?

222
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,289
Please get a hold of yourself! Waka!

223
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:41,689
Waka...

224
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,652
Ran.

225
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,152
Ran, wake up!

226
00:12:57,552 --> 00:13:01,352
Ran! Ran!

227
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:02,552
Conan.

228
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:04,652
I'm glad! You're back.

229
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:05,952
Are you okay?

230
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm sorry for all this.

231
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,252
Masumi.

232
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,152
What happened to me?

233
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,952
Ouch.

234
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:16,452
You were collapsed in the bathroom.

235
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:21,652
It's terrible! I found Waka in the bathroom floor bleeding!

236
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:24,252
Yeah. So, see.

237
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,852
The police are here now and investigating.

238
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,652
What happened?

239
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:34,852
I heard the sound of the shower coming from the bathroom.

240
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:38,952
I went inside and found Waka inside the steam.

241
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,652
I tried to carry her up

242
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,052
but I suddenly felt faint.

243
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,152
Didn't you see anybody suspicious?

244
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,552
Nope.

245
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:49,052
I searched in the closet too,

246
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,752
but found nobody.

247
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,452
Why the closet?

248
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:56,452
Waka has a habit of sleeping in strange places when she comes back drunk.

249
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,952
Rumi who was with me told me so...

250
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,352
Come to think of it, what about Rumi?

251
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,052
I'm fine.

252
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:07,752
I'm sorry I got you messed up in something terrible like this.

253
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,052
Rumi!

254
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:10,352
Unfortunately,

255
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:15,552
I fainted in the bathroom too after finding you and Waka.

256
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:18,452
I didn't see the culprit though.

257
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:21,452
Kenya, you and the others came to look for us

258
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,652
because we didn't return for quite a while, right?

259
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,052
Yeah.

260
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:27,852
You weren't back even after 30 minutes,

261
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:30,752
so I called you on the cell but got no answer either.

262
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:33,552
We told the manager of this condo what happened

263
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,352
and had him open the door for us.

264
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,052
-Right? -Yeah.

265
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:40,952
Then, we found all three of you collapsed on the floor.

266
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,252
We rushed and called the police.

267
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,852
But, what was that smell?

268
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,252
I felt faint at the bathtub.

269
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,352
Chloroform.

270
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,852
It's a kind of anesthesia

271
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:00,552
and if a lot is inhaled, you pass out.

272
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:03,252
There are cases when it can kill you too.

273
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:07,252
It evaporated in the bathtub and filled the entire room.

274
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:12,752
Well, this boy turned on the ventilation right away,

275
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,652
so it's all right now.

276
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:18,152
So, the anesthesia got to Waka...

277
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:21,752
Can't you see for yourself?

278
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,952
She was slugged to death!

279
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:28,652
She was hit on the head with a blunt object and killed.

280
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:31,952
But, why was the anesthesia used?

281
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:34,852
Besides, is the one who's dead really Waka?

282
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,552
We can't see her face through that facial pack.

283
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:40,552
Then, please confirm it, will you?

284
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,552
Waka!

285
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:47,952
Watch it!

286
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:50,652
Don't go inside.

287
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,852
Talk about a strange corpse.

288
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,652
She's winking.

289
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,552
Besides,

290
00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:58,952
something's dripping out from the corner of her eye.

291
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:02,452
Mascara?

292
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,952
At first glance, it looks as if someone struck Waka on the head

293
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:12,152
just as she was getting ready to take a bath.

294
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,152
This may be...

295
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:20,252
Then, this is what happened?

296
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,652
You four had arrangements to have lunch together today.

297
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:30,052
And, you were all going to gather here at the condo of the victim at noon.

298
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:34,452
But, since you got worried that she didn't come down at all,

299
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,452
Ran who coincidentally happened to meet Rumi

300
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:40,352
came to check things out at this room together

301
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,652
but even after the doorbell was rung, there was no answer.

302
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,052
So, you used the spare key

303
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,552
that Mr. Settsu who used to go with the victim gave you,

304
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:51,552
opened the front door and came inside.

305
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,152
Then, at that time,

306
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,952
Mr. Settsu called you, Rumi, on the phone.

307
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:59,252
So, Ran ended up having to go to look for Waka alone.

308
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,352
And found her collapsed on the bathroom floor,

309
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,652
but she collapsed from inhaling the chloroform.

310
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:08,452
Rumi, who came along later, also fell asleep.

311
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,352
Then, 30 minutes later,

312
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,452
worried about the two that didn't come back for some time,

313
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,552
all of you came up here to check.

314
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:18,352
As a result, you found the three collapsed on the floor in the bathroom.

315
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,652
Yeah, that's about right.

316
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:24,552
The front door was locked

317
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:26,152
and we had some difficulty trying to open it,

318
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:28,652
so reporting to the police was a bit delayed.

319
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,052
I happen to be a worrier,

320
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,352
so I have a habit of locking doors no matter where I am.

321
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:36,552
By the way,

322
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:40,252
is it true that the victim was drinking liquor till 05:00 this morning?

323
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:43,352
Yeah, she was drinking with me in this room, just the two of us.

324
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,352
We invited Settsu and Rumi to come too,

325
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,752
but they didn't come saying they'd be seeing us tomorrow anyway.

326
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:51,752
I had to listen to a load of stink talk about her ex-boyfriend, Settsu,

327
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:54,252
until she fell asleep wasted.

328
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:56,552
Then, what about the key to the front door?

329
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:58,252
Of course,

330
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:00,152
I woke Waka up before I left

331
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:01,952
and made her lock the door.

332
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,752
But this sure is a fine condo to be living alone in.

333
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:12,352
Waka's father is an executive of a famous company, you see.

334
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:15,852
Well, the only one who wasn't surprised at seeing this room

335
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:19,852
was a freshman who entered our circle this year.

336
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,152
Her father

337
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,752
seems to be the chairman of a company affiliated to Waka's father's.

338
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,752
Hey.

339
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,752
When you came in here with Ran using the spare key,

340
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,352
Mr. Settsu seems to have called you,

341
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:35,052
but what did he call you for?

342
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,252
He asked me to look for something for him.

343
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:41,552
He forgot something here when he was going with Waka.

344
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,552
He asked me to look for it and bring to him.

345
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:47,052
Well, he asked me for it before,

346
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:50,052
so I was going to bring it to him even without the phone call, though.

347
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,252
What did you forget?

348
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:55,752
A wristwatch. It was my favorite.

349
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,952
I thought I left it somewhere in the living room, you see.

350
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:02,452
If Waka was still asleep,

351
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:03,552
I was going to ask her to go in with the spare key

352
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:07,352
and secretly retrieve it.

353
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,552
It seems that she couldn't find it,

354
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:12,252
so Waka may have found it and got rid of it.

355
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:16,952
The living room is the large room where the veranda is, right?

356
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,652
Yes.

357
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,452
I got the call and went out to the veranda,

358
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,752
so it was great timing for me to look for it, but...

359
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:26,052
Since this is a skyscraper,

360
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:29,052
unless I go out to the veranda, the connection is bad, you see.

361
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,752
That's why I asked you to go look for Waka.

362
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:33,852
Yes.

363
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:37,152
Which means...

364
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:40,952
Rumi went in from the front door over to the living room to the left

365
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:45,052
and Ran went to look on the right side where the bedroom is.

366
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:47,152
Talking of the veranda,

367
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,352
there were times when Waka came home drunk

368
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,452
and slept on the veranda too, right?

369
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:55,352
Yeah, I heard about that some time ago.

370
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:57,652
She was really wasted and called me

371
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,852
saying that she was trying to sober up by getting some breeze.

372
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:03,652
But, she fell asleep on me on the phone.

373
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,352
I got worried and came to check,

374
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:08,152
and found her leaning against the veranda fast asleep.

375
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,552
There were times when she fell asleep under the bed too.

376
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,752
But this time,

377
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:15,352
she didn't sleep on the veranda or under the bed,

378
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:19,052
but was sleeping in the bathroom as a corpse.

379
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,152
And the person who did this to her

380
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:26,952
is the one who had the key to this room.

381
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,852
In other words, one of you two.

382
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,752
-Hey! -Hold it.

383
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:35,652
Her ex-boyfriend, Settsu had a spare key,

384
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,052
but I didn't have any key.

385
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,452
I'll bet you drank with the victim till early in the morning today,

386
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,052
got her wasted

387
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:43,052
and secretly took the key home with you.

388
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,552
As long as you come running over,

389
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,952
and throw the key out somewhere here, you could easily deceive everybody.

390
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,052
It's possible that you were here until noon

391
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:52,152
when you were supposed to meet with everyone else too.

392
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:55,552
If... if it's the key, Rumi may also have had it.

393
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,352
Because until Settsu and Waka started going with each other,

394
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:59,852
she was room sharing here with Waka.

395
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:02,252
I returned the key to her long ago!

396
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,852
I see.

397
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:11,652
If there's a possibility that all three of you had the key,

398
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,852
all three of you could've committed the crime.

399
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:16,252
No.

400
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,952
The only ones who could've killed Waka by the time Ran found her...

401
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:26,552
are Mr. Settsu and Mr. Kaga.

402
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,052
What the...

403
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:36,052
Mr. Kaga came just before Ran and Rumi went to call Waka at her room.

404
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:38,052
Just about 30 minutes before that,

405
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:41,452
Mr. Settsu left to go to the restroom, right?

406
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:45,952
If the two had the key to Waka's room...

407
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:49,452
If you use the stairs where they are no surveillance cameras...

408
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:54,252
it's possible to kill Waka without being seen by anyone.

409
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:58,252
As to that, Rumi was with me right through until we all came here.

410
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,752
She didn't even go to the restroom

411
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,352
until we went to Waka's room.

412
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:05,852
She couldn't have committed the crime.

413
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:07,652
You were with Rumi?

414
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:09,752
Rather, who are you?

415
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:10,852
A detective...

416
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,752
Who was hired by Rumi.

417
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,652
"Next Episode" -At any rate...

418
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,352
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:51,352 --> 00:23:53,752
Thank you for helping me pick them up!

420
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:55,052
Here you go.

421
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,952
Be careful not to drop it again.

422
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:02,152
If that corpse wasn't Waka,

423
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,752
it would be a different story.

424
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,252
What?

425
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:08,752
Next Conan,

426
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:12,652
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 2)".

427
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,152
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,852
"Wink".

429
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,752
-It's almost June. -From May to June.

430
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,677
Mascara from the eyes.
