1
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,718
The members of the Youth Detective Squad are today's hero.

2
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,218
A boisterous racket breaks out.

3
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,618
Right before the game soft appears on the market.

4
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,218
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,918
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,919
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,058
Hey! It's there!

8
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,258
Look!

9
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,258
So that's where "Gadlin One" was made, isn't it?

10
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,258
It's amazing!

11
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,759
Yeah, I know!

12
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,258
It's so cool!

13
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,358
I really can't wait.

14
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,458
So, is that it?

15
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,758
Is that the TV game you all got hooked on?

16
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,958
That's...

17
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,259
-"Gadlin"! -"Gadlin"!

18
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,558
And this is where the awesome game is being made!

19
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,058
The Shining!

20
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,658
How can you forget, Conan?

21
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,659
"Gadlin" is a million-seller TV game, you know?

22
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,358
This is episode one!

23
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:52,358
I think you are the only one

24
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,758
who doesn't know about this TV game.

25
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,458
I don't really care.

26
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,658
Episode two is finally coming out next week!

27
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,558
There were seven mysteries left unsolved in episode one,

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,658
but everything is gonna to be solved in the second one.

29
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,758
I really can't wait!

30
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,058
What's waiting at the end!

31
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,059
Gadlin! Please, tell me!

32
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,958
Hey!

33
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,659
Where do you guys think you're going?

34
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:38,059
"Fugitive TV Game."

35
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,558
Can I help you?

36
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,459
What? Yes.

37
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,458
Actually...

38
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,058
Could you do us a favor?

39
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:52,558
Could you tell us the seven mysteries in "Gadlin Two", please?

40
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,758
You don't have to tell us everything. Just a little!

41
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,958
Please?

42
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,558
"Yukari Hachisuka (25)" -No. I cannot do that.

43
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,258
Okay, then, what about a hint?

44
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,259
Please?

45
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,858
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,658
You have to wait until it comes out,

47
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,659
Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

48
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,858
Do you know my name?

49
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,458
Yes. Of course!

50
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,959
You are famous.

51
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,259
That's not so true.

52
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,658
You got your name tag on your backpack.

53
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,659
What?

54
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,058
I see.

55
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,658
I need to go!

56
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,558
I need to go to washroom.

57
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,158
What? Washroom?

58
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,358
Oh, please, Genta!

59
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:45,858
I really can't hold it! I'm in danger!

60
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,558
I'm going to use your washroom, okay?

61
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,559
Kid!

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,558
-Hey! -Genta!

63
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,259
This is bad... I need to hurry!

64
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,758
Oh my god. Where is it?

65
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,058
Hey, what are you doing here?

66
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,858
You can't come up here!

67
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,358
Wait, I'm going to pee in my pants!

68
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,458
Let me use your washroom, please!

69
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,958
Genta!

70
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,258
Hey, you! Wait!

71
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,858
Don't talk to me...

72
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,558
-Hey! -Where is it?

73
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,858
-Wait! -Hey!

74
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,358
I'm going to pee in my pants if I keep running.

75
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,558
Wait!

76
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:19,859
Oh no! Don't tell me it's a dead end!

77
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,958
Come on, hurry up!

78
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,858
Washroom... Is it this way?

79
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,159
Kids, where are you!

80
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,959
-Let's go, guys! -Is it okay here?

81
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,859
Which floor is the washroom?

82
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,259
"This Month's Topic: Nobukazu Michiba."

83
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,659
Come in.

84
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,658
President Michiba!

85
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,558
The subscription sales of "Gadlin Two" have gone over two hundred thousand!

86
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,558
"Nobukazu Michiba (36)" -It's gonna be a huge hit.

87
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,358
Even bigger than the first one!

88
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,558
Of course.

89
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,158
For "Gadlin Two",

90
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,358
I worked as hard as I could.

91
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,558
It have to be a huge hit.

92
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,858
Nobukazu Michiba, a genius game producer.

93
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,958
You're the superstar of the gaming world.

94
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,158
You're also a genius scenario writer.

95
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,559
Well, let's do the final check.

96
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,658
You can never be too sure, right?

97
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,859
See you later.

98
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,958
Michiba!

99
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,558
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

100
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,058
"Shinji Kobayashi (36)" -It was what I wrote when I was in college!

101
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,658
It was all in my notebook!

102
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,758
And you just stole them all without my permission!

103
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,158
So what are you trying to say?

104
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,558
I'm going to tell the media that you stole my idea!

105
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,058
See you in court!

106
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,358
Darn it!

107
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,859
-What are you doing? -You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

108
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:29,258
Kobayashi was murdered...

109
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,058
two nights ago in this room.

110
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,058
Who are you?

111
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,058
Me?

112
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,158
I'm a detective hired by Kobayashi.

113
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,858
Kobayashi had been searching for evidence of plagiarism.

114
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,558
It will be quite useful in court.

115
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,058
So for his evidence searching,

116
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:51,259
I was hired to spy on you with a hidden camera.

117
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,459
It was worth doing it.

118
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:04,658
With two hundred million yen, you can buy this disk.

119
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,258
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:09,558
Hey! Stay right there!

121
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:13,358
Sorry, I just don't wanna be shot like Kobayashi.

122
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,758
Oh, yeah, before I forget...

123
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,858
If anything happens to me,

124
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:22,358
the master tape of this movie will be played in public, just so you know.

125
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,658
Now again, it's two hundred million yen.

126
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,958
You earned tons and tons of money with "Gadlin One".

127
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,858
This much money is nothing to you, right?

128
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:32,959
But remember, I'm not here to negotiate with you!

129
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,258
I got it.

130
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,558
Yeah, that's my friend.

131
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,058
Mr. President.

132
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,959
Who would?

133
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,459
What are you doing?

134
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,159
What are you trying to do?

135
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,459
Where did they go?

136
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,158
He's gone.

137
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,259
Hey, where's Genta?

138
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,858
Where is the master tape?

139
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,959
Say it!

140
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:25,058
Or you want to die, right now?

141
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,458
Now I'm back!

142
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,758
It was close though...

143
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,659
What... Where is this?

144
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,159
Looks so nice. Whose room is this?

145
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,659
A TV game?

146
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,358
"Gadlin Two"?

147
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,758
No way!

148
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,658
It's "Gadlin Two"!

149
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,959
Genta!

150
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,458
Where were you?

151
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,658
We were worried about you!

152
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,158
The guard is still looking for us. He's mad.

153
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,958
Look what you did!

154
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,158
We got to get out of here right now!

155
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,958
Come on, Genta! Hurry up!

156
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,059
Kids?

157
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,758
-I'm sorry! -Hey, wait!

158
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,259
It's nothing! Kids, stop!

159
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,758
There you are!

160
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,858
Go that way!

161
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,558
Mr. Michiba!

162
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,358
Get them, go! They stole "Gadlin Two"!

163
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,459
What?

164
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:39,658
Take the stairs! I'll be coming too!

165
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,759
Yes, sir!

166
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,959
I'm over if that disk goes public!

167
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,659
Hurry up...

168
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,959
-Conan! -Hurry...

169
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,858
Now, hurry!

170
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,158
Hey!

171
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,858
Wait!

172
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,958
Where did they go?

173
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,258
Outside! They went outside!

174
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,459
Okay!

175
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,958
A gun? What's going on?

176
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,059
All right.

177
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,759
I'm so sorry!

178
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,458
What are you doing here? Is that your friend?

179
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,858
-What? -Forget it!

180
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,059
Get out of here!

181
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,558
I'm sorry. I couldn't catch them.

182
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,658
What?

183
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,558
They all had a bike.

184
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,858
I could never imagine kids sneaking into a huge building

185
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,258
and stealing things!

186
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,558
You got to be kidding!

187
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,658
Who are they?

188
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,958
Sorry.

189
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,658
He is...

190
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,458
I remember his name is Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School.

191
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,258
Teitan Primary School.

192
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,558
Genta Kojima?

193
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,558
Should I call the police?

194
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,958
No, don't! I'll go!

195
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,458
You guys go back to work!

196
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,859
Yes, sir.

197
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,958
Those kids think that the disk is "Gadlin Two".

198
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,158
They'll play it as soon as they get home!

199
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,058
I must prevent it or else, we are over!

200
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,959
Search the address of Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

201
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,558
Now I see what is happening.

202
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,758
When you get the info, go to his house before him, got it, Bee?

203
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,259
Bee? Is that the name of his partner?

204
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,558
For kids, it would take 30 minutes to get to Beika-cho.

205
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,658
If they don't come home within 30 minutes, then.

206
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,758
Darn!

207
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,158
What bad timing!

208
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,058
The bug is broken!

209
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:57,758
This is bad. They are in danger!

210
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,458
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

211
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,659
Ayumi!

212
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,286
Beika. Beika.

213
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,886
Please do not forget your belongings when leaving the train.

214
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:13,187
Hurry!

215
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:16,887
Here!

216
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:23,287
"No entry for cars."

217
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:27,686
What are we gonna do?

218
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,386
Those guys looked mad.

219
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:34,286
I just used the washroom. What's wrong with that?

220
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:37,087
I'm so hungry since we ran so hard.

221
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:42,286
This happened because you went inside the building all of a sudden!

222
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,586
Did you know that?

223
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:45,786
What the...

224
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,687
What? What is it, Genta?

225
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:50,887
Actually...

226
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:51,986
What?

227
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:53,887
I got something in my bag.

228
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,786
This is...

229
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,487
-"Gadlin Two", isn't it? -"Gadlin Two"! No way!

230
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,386
It's real!

231
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:06,987
Although this is the dummy version, it's the real "Gadlin Two"!

232
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,786
Yeah, I know.

233
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:14,386
But Genta, how did you get this?

234
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:18,786
Well, actually it was just inside my backpack.

235
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,486
In your backpack, you said?

236
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,686
How? How did I get this?

237
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,386
It's the fancy room!

238
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:32,286
No wonder they were trying so hard to catch us.

239
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,886
Hold it! Hey!

240
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,286
I see. So this is the reason why.

241
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,686
Genta! We are in a pretty serious situation right now.

242
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:40,886
That's right.

243
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:44,586
Although it wasn't intentional, this is still stealing.

244
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:47,786
Plus, the game is not in store yet.

245
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,586
Stealing? Me?

246
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,687
This is why we're being chased.

247
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,287
"If you have seen this boy, call 110."

248
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,186
Finally, the suspect, a primary school boy,

249
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,486
Genta Kojima, has been arrested by the police!

250
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,986
According to the police,

251
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,886
it's been found that the suspect is involved in many other crimes

252
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,487
besides the stolen "Gadlin Two" case.

253
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,786
-Genta! -Genta!

254
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,486
Genta Kojima!

255
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,586
We've got all the evidence already!

256
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,786
You're the one who broke the headmaster's vase, aren't you?

257
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,787
Me?

258
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,586
I know you didn't do your homework three days in a row

259
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:28,586
and also skipped your cleanup duty.

260
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,786
We've got a witness saying that you didn't wash your hands

261
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:33,886
before eating your lunch!

262
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,886
What are you? A beast?

263
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,286
Have you forgot your own language!

264
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,386
We know you did it!

265
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,286
Come on, spit it all out!

266
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,586
Genta Kojima!

267
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,287
I'm sorry!

268
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:54,587
I think you should turn yourself in, Genta!

269
00:15:56,587 --> 00:16:01,286
But before that, I want to eat grilled eel.

270
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,886
My mom told me that we're having grilled eel for dinner!

271
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,486
It's not too late yet, right?

272
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,687
What the...

273
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,586
It's been an hour already.

274
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:12,886
Those people from The Shining must think that

275
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:16,886
the kids have seen what's in the disk.

276
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:19,187
They're seriously in danger!

277
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:22,487
They're back!

278
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,387
Hey!

279
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,887
What the...

280
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,886
Everyone! Move! Move!

281
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:48,887
Oh no!

282
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,486
It hurts...

283
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,886
That guy is seriously mad!

284
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,686
-Let's go! -Ayumi! Hurry up!

285
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,087
Wait!

286
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,487
Take this!

287
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,386
Hey! Wake up!

288
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:43,886
Take that gun and kill them, Bee!

289
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,486
Go, now!

290
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,386
That was his partner, Bee.

291
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:52,687
Bee has a gun and is chasing Genta and the rest now.

292
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,486
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

293
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,586
Ayumi!

294
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,886
Where are you all?

295
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:01,987
It's possible that they went there.

296
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,786
Hurry, Genta!

297
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,186
I'm starving. I can't walk anymore.

298
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:15,387
Be a man! You're the one who caused this trouble!

299
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:21,486
Let's just go and put the game back.

300
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,386
And apologize.

301
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:24,487
Let's go!

302
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:34,286
No one's here.

303
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,286
It was here.

304
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,287
Then, put it there.

305
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,086
Okay? Three, two, one.

306
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,286
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry.

307
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,786
I hope our apology is accepted.

308
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,486
I hope so too.

309
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:50,686
Genta!

310
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:51,986
Hey!

311
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:55,086
Can we watch "Gadlin Two" just a little, before we go?

312
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,986
Oh, no!

313
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,186
Don't!

314
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:00,686
What are you doing?

315
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,786
Only the seven mysteries.

316
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,786
Just a little.

317
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,386
-The seven mysteries? -The seven mysteries?

318
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,687
Just a little, yeah?

319
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:23,887
Michiba!

320
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:26,886
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

321
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,486
What is this?

322
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,986
See you in court!

323
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:34,286
You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

324
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,586
What are you doing, Michiba?

325
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,586
You jerk!

326
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,586
You stole my "Gadlin"!

327
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,486
Now you're stabbing me in the back!

328
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,086
Just because you can't beat me! Michiba,

329
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:46,486
you haven't changed at all since you were in college.

330
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,786
Shut up!

331
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:53,087
How hard do you think I worked on creating this software?

332
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:59,186
No way! You're better than this, Michiba!

333
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:00,187
-No way! -No way!

334
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:03,087
It... It's the woman that was at the front desk!

335
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,186
Yes, it was me.

336
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,287
-What? -What?

337
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,586
You saw what's in the disk.

338
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,487
Now I have to kill you all.

339
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,886
No. Please, don't!

340
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,486
No! I have to eat mom's grilled eel.

341
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:27,687
Really? That's too bad, Genta Kojima.

342
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,586
As I suspected, it was you.

343
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:32,987
Yukari Hachisuka.

344
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,586
Conan!

345
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,586
-Conan! -Conan!

346
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:43,586
When Michiba called his partner "B", it dawned on me that.

347
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:46,586
"B" stood for "Bee", an insect.

348
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,687
In Japanese, bee is "hachi"?

349
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,186
Hachisuka.

350
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,786
Your last name has also the word "hachi" in it,

351
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:00,187
so I concluded that Bee was your code name.

352
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,986
I guess you are in a relationship with Michiba, aren't you?

353
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:07,886
Yes. We are gonna get married soon.

354
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,486
And in order to protect our promised future,

355
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,286
I would do anything!

356
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,986
Anything, literally.

357
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:14,987
Conan!

358
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:17,486
Miss! Please, don't!

359
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:18,686
Did you know?

360
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:22,887
That all this conversation is being recorded by the police.

361
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,187
Cell phone!

362
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,686
Yukari Hachisuka!

363
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:35,186
You're under arrest for attempted murder!

364
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:36,987
It's game over, isn't it?

365
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:43,186
Thus, Yukari Hachisuka and President Michiba were arrested.

366
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,586
The blackmail detective was found alive.

367
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,486
Also, the kids seemed to have learned that

368
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:53,687
their stupidity had caused a lot of trouble.

369
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,086
If I didn't go to the washroom,

370
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:29,286
the murder case would have still been left unsolved!

371
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:30,886
Yeah, you are right!

372
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,086
Good job, Genta!

373
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,487
You're the man, Genta!

374
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:40,186
We are gonna fight the evils.

375
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,986
We are the ones to save this town!

376
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,586
-Yeah! -Yeah!

377
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:47,687
-Victory for The Youth Detective Squad!

378
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,486
Hey! Haven't they learned the lesson!

379
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:53,987
Oh, shoots!

380
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:01,387
"Next Episode."

381
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:09,286
That is...

382
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:11,286
The uniform of the Jaguars.

383
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,987
Police!

384
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,787
How did you know?

385
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:27,487
Next Conan, "The Silent Route (Part 1)"

386
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,986
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:44,987 --> 00:24:47,486
"Tennis ball."

388
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,286
-Next week is the Athens Olympics! -Let's go, Japan!

389
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,987
-The week after next, we will be in Okinawa! -That's not fair!
