1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,033
Hold it! Freeze!

2
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,633
Stay away!

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,733
You're not getting away!

4
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,333
A canvas stained black with crime.

5
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,833
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

6
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,933
Pops is full of weak points,

7
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,033
but they have to be overcome.

8
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,833
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,833
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,233
His name is Detective Conan!

"Weak Point of the Great Detective"

12
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,347
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

13
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,947
"Taxi"

14
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:01,447
What? The gun disappeared?

15
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,247
Just what do you mean, Inspector Megure?

16
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,347
When the suspect was arrested,

17
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:10,147
he didn't have a gun, much less a knife.

18
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:12,447
Well... but...

19
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,747
Yes. It's true that he robbed the bank

20
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:17,147
and fired the gun.

21
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:21,547
And, it's also a fact that he fired at you, Mr. Mouri

22
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,047
who determined where he was and fled.

23
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,547
Which means...

24
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:28,347
He either hid it somewhere or disposed of it.

25
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:31,447
Those are the only options.

26
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,447
It's strange.

27
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:38,847
The gun wasn't found at the site of his arrest either, was it?

28
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,247
Conan.

29
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:41,247
Ran.

30
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:44,147
Gee, you really had me worried, Dad.

31
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:47,047
It's nothing but a scratch.

32
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:01,847
"Mouri Detective Agency"

33
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:20,547
He had a fear of heights to begin with,

34
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,347
and went through that sort of experience.

35
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,747
So it seems he's in a slight state of shock.

36
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:30,547
The doctor said that he'd be fine

37
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:33,747
if he refrains from going out for a while and rests.

38
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:36,547
Darn.

39
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,547
Two days have already gone by since then and yet.

40
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,747
How pathetic, for Kogoro Mouri,

41
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,047
a great detective like me.

42
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,447
Dad.

43
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:52,347
The doctor also told you to keep from drinking too, didn't he?

44
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,347
Shut up.

45
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,547
I know.

46
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,447
"Live"

47
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:01,847
"Taizo Sakaki (43), President of a futures group" -The bail is expensive.

48
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:05,347
If I'm innocent, the courthouse is the real scam.

49
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,247
Just kidding.

50
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,647
Defendant Taizo Sakaki has just been released on bail.

51
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:16,047
He will later stand trial for fraud charges of the group he leads.

52
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:35,447
That's...

53
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,147
He's been shot.

54
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:42,047
Defendant Sakaki's been shot.

55
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,047
-What? -No.

56
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,547
Darn. That gun...

57
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,047
Hello.

58
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:57,247
Mr. Mouri.

59
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,547
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush over to the site.

60
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,547
What? What did you say?

61
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:05,147
The gun that was used was the gun that disappeared?

62
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,447
"Beika General Hospital"

63
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,047
"Forensic Investigation Laboratory" -It matched. Yes.

64
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:26,147
It's undoubtedly the same gun.

65
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:28,647
"Sasaki" -Yes.

66
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,847
He's in critical condition needing to be hospitalized for a month.

67
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:34,247
But, since it was a 22 caliber of small impact,

68
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,247
his life is not in danger.

69
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,947
Are you really okay, Pops?

70
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,447
Ran's worried about you too.

71
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:45,747
As long as I don't climb up somewhere high, I'm just fine.

72
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,447
Rather, this is my case.

73
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:51,447
I'll get the gun back with my very hands.

74
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,347
That's fine but... to begin with...

75
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,247
Stay away!

76
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:59,147
The robber who had the gun and...

77
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,847
The person who was shot,

78
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,647
did they have any connection?

79
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:07,147
Connection? Why would they?

80
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:09,547
As for the gun, it was an absolute coincidence

81
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:12,547
that the perpetrator got hold of it.

82
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,247
Probably back then...

83
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,347
Wasn't any likely person there?

84
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:37,847
While you were chasing the robber?

85
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,547
So, in order to recall back then...

86
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,047
I'm here again at the site...

87
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,347
Come to think of it...

88
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,247
Hold it!

89
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:58,247
Excuse me.

90
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,447
I won't let you get away!

91
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:05,947
Don't tell me that she took the gun?

92
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,847
Do you remember her face?

93
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,947
What about her clothes or something she was holding?

94
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,547
If I remember correctly,

95
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:17,347
she had a tote bag

96
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,847
and a convenience store bag.

97
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,547
Pops, look at that.

98
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:25,747
Do you know her?

99
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,247
Really?

100
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,747
I think she's a regular.

101
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:30,847
What's her name?

102
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,347
I don't know.

103
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:36,147
Only she always comes out of that condo over there.

104
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:42,047
Pops, look.

105
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,847
This license plate...

106
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,247
It's the perpetrator's motorbike.

107
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,247
Room 403, is it?

108
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:58,147
All right. Found her.

109
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,947
Don't you have to call Inspector Megure?

110
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,347
I know.

111
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,947
Rather, how come you're here?

112
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,947
It's dangerous, so go on home already. Understand?

113
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,447
Inspector, Mouri here.

114
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,047
I'm worried about you.

115
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,447
Rather, did you just realize now that I was here?

116
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,847
Hey. I said it's dangerous so go home.

117
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,847
Never mind, just hurry.

118
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,947
Room 403 is...

119
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,047
You...

120
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,647
Hold it!

121
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,847
Pops.

122
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,047
This smell?

123
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,647
This is...

124
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,047
The perpetrator's...

125
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,947
Shoots.

126
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,246
We found the suspect.

127
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:44,746
Izumi Onda, age 26.

128
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:47,546
She works for a printing office nearby.

129
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,246
She seems to have been a candidate

130
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:52,546
for the Olympic Shooting sport in the past.

131
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:55,246
Her motive was that her father invested a large sum

132
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,646
in the futures offered by the Sakaki Group,

133
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:02,146
"Onda Machinery" -which eventually led his factory to bankruptcy.

134
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:04,946
He committed suicide six months ago.

135
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,646
Her mother also fell ill after that

136
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:10,246
and died as if following her husband.

137
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:11,546
And...

138
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:17,846
"Sasaki Group Information, Taizo Sakaki, Kohei Shibazaki, Rina Kadota"

139
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:21,946

00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,646
"Sasaki Group"

Let me go.

144
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,246
Let go.

145
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:58,546
Let go, I said.

146
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,146
Mr. Shibazaki and Ms. Kadota.

"Kohei Shibazaki (35), Trader"

148
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,746
President Sakaki's confidants

149
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,346
and the ones who are rumored to be arrested of the same fraud charges

150
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:13,446
"Rina Kadota (32), Analyst" that he's been accused of.

151
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,046
Who the heck are you?

152
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:16,746
Just where do you think this is?

153
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,746
We're sorry to intrude on you without notice.

154
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:22,446
Did anyone come to ask you

155
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:25,946
of what your schedule for today is?

156
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,246
My secretary was asked that a while ago.

157
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,146
I figured it was a call from the media or something.

158
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,546
Was it from a man or a woman?

159
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,946
I think she said it was the voice of a young woman.

160
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,446
So, you're saying that you're going to guard us

161
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,546
since someone is after our lives?

162
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,346
Don't you understand?

163
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:54,046
There's no need for anything like that.

164
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,146
Mr. Mouri, Conan.

165
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,546
Are you all right?

166
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,246
Hold it! You...

167
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:13,246
Are you all right, Pops?

168
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,646
Darn.

169
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:17,246
Takagi, Chiba, do you know where the perpetrator is?

170
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,246
Our APB's haven't found her yet.

171
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:23,246
Rather, I think you should rest, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,646
We'll take care of things here.

173
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:28,546
If the perpetrator appears, we'll make sure she doesn't get away.

174
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,146
What is it?

175
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,946
Something's bothering me.

176
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,646
I wonder what on earth it is?

177
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:40,046
It's been two hours since then.

178
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,746
I wonder what the perpetrator's doing?

179
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,046
Hurry up and show up.

180
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:48,846
I wonder why she didn't target these two first?

181
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:49,846
What?

182
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,346
The perpetrator got a hold of the gun

183
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:55,746
two days before President Sakaki was released on bail, right?

184
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:59,046
Back then, the police didn't even know

185
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,046
that she was going to target these two.

186
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:04,746
Maybe she just wanted to get rid of the big shot first.

187
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,546
What? Wait a second.

188
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,746
Back then, it wasn't even known

189
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,646
if he was going to be released on bail or not either.

190
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:11,946
It's odd.

191
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:15,946
She hasn't even finished off the big one yet.

192
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,746
She fired an accurate warning shot but...

193
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:23,346
She failed to shoot down her actual target.

194
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,846
She was riding a motorbike then.

195
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:33,046
Even a candidate for the Olympics...

196
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,046
probably didn't think she'd miss either.

197
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:41,346
But it was a serious but non-fatal injury.

198
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:46,546
Would she really leave the unexpected remain the unexpected?

199
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,746
I get it.

200
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,946
In other words, the perpetrator asked about the schedule

201
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:56,546
to mislead us.

202
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,246
Yeah, I think you're right.

203
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,846
She's trying to distract us,

204
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:05,246
while in the meantime she finishes off her primary target.

205
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:09,646
And finish Sakaki off.

206
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:12,946
"Evacuation drill today"

207
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,446
"Sasaki"

208
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:23,746
Where did Mr. Sakaki go?

209
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,546
That's why we should buy now.

210
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,846
We'll definitely sell soon.

211
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,046
You...

212
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:42,446
I see, so it was you.

213
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,546
I've got to make sure to get rid of you.

214
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:48,146
Otherwise, nothing will begin and nothing will end.

215
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:51,946
Darn. It's not coming at all.

216
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,446
-Pops. -What?

217
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:54,746
"Stairs"

218
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,246
No joke?

219
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,946
What floor is this?

220
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,146
Pops, are you all right?

221
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:12,846
Of course I am. This is no big deal.

222
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,246
I'll go on ahead, then.

223
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:18,946
Wait! Kid! It's dangerous, let's go to...

224
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:21,246
Darn. I won't look.

225
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,146
I'm not going to look.

226
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:34,746
Pops! We can't go out from here!

227
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:37,546
What?

228
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,946
Why didn't you hurry up and tell me?

229
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,846
"Emergency exit" -What? That's...

230
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,646
Idiot.

231
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,046
I would never come alone.

232
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,546
I did it in self-defense!

233
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,346
Get lost!

234
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,046
Don't underestimate me.

235
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:08,846
I can handle heights.

236
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:10,646
Even if I'm scared...

237
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,146
I'm...

238
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:16,146
The great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

239
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:21,346
Pops.

240
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,746
Pops, you did it.

241
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,546
Don't shoot!

242
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:56,546
Don't shoot.

243
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:59,546
Move. If you don't, I'll shoot you too.

244
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,446
Forget it already, Izumi.

245
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:22,146
Don't be ridiculous. Stop it!

246
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:24,146
If I can't even avenge their deaths,

247
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,546
I've no other choice than to die,

248
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:29,646
because I'm so worthless.

249
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,246
I finally got it...

250
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:34,146
why you didn't go after those two.

251
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:36,846
You weren't sure, were you?

252
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,546
Shoots.

253
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:46,746
Hello. Inspector, I have a favor to ask you.

254
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:48,546
Please hurry.

255
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:51,546
Rather... after he was arrested,

256
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:55,146
you had long decided against taking revenge, right?

257
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,546
This is my hunch as a detective but,

258
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:05,746
back then you were in shopping, weren't you, Izumi?

259
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,946
You overcame your anger and grief

260
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,446
and was getting back to living a normal life.

261
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:12,546
Am I wrong?

262
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:18,946
But, it's a fact that deep down you weren't sure.

263
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:23,146
That's why you happened to take the gun

264
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,146
that the robber accidentally dropped.

265
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:33,246
But, you still weren't sure.

266
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:39,146
You didn't go after those two,

267
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:42,346
but after you saw Sakaki released on bail,

268
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:45,346
your feelings of revenge built up again.

269
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:46,946
Even so...

270
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:49,546
why would you want to kill yourself?

271
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:50,746
You're unworthy?

272
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,046
Wrong.

273
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:53,346
Izumi.

274
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:57,546
Didn't you have an intimate relationship with this guy?

275
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:07,246
I'd like you to check on this once more on these lines.

276
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:10,346
I found it.

277
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,646
From Takagi?

278
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,246
This is...

279
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,846
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

280
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,446
You're absolutely correct.

281
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,546
Just because they trusted that guy

282
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:31,446
for being their daughter's boyfriend.

283
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:35,246
Dad and Mom...

284
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,846
More than anything else,

285
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,446
I cannot forgive myself!

286
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,846
But, if you didn't have the gun in the first place...

287
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:46,646
If only I had taken the gun back then...

288
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,146
It's my fault,

289
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,146
no matter if it was a coincidence that you ended up picking the gun up.

290
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:54,446
So, if you're going to shoot, shoot me!

291
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:55,746
Don't die!

292
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,346
Pops.

293
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:02,846
Thank you.

294
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,546
But...

295
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,446
It's too late.

296
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:08,646
Don't!

297
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,246
Pops!

298
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:35,546
They made it.

299
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,246
Later, it was decided

300
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:44,146
that Attorney-At-Law Kisaki would serve as Izumi's lawyer.

301
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,046
As for the group that committed fraud,

302
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:48,246
a new evidence was found

303
00:21:48,246 --> 00:21:49,946
and another investigation was started.

306
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,946
Completely recovered!

307
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:32,146
I guess I'm still not completely cured.

308
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,546
Rather, you're just drinking too much.

309
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,846
Gee. I tell you, Dad.

Yeah, the floor on the very top.

Die!

314
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:59,146
I did it.

315
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,446
Mr. Takarada?

316
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:08,646
Yeah. He asked for it.
