1
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:23,236
Today's problem is a ghost scare.

2
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:24,836
Shine the light on unseen feelings

3
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,836
to resolve the ghost scare at school.

4
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,336
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,136
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:32,134
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:03,212
Due to the off-season ghost scare at Teitan High school,

8
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,812
Ran begs Pops to solve the mystery of the scare,

9
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:09,012
but he refuses, saying that it is nonsense.

10
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,812
Therefore, out of my consideration for Ran whom I know hates ghosts,

11
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:14,512
I decide to participate in solving the mystery.

12
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:17,312
After school, when we were checking out the school building,

13
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:21,713
we find a desk that is very inappropriately on the campus grounds.

14
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,013
My grudge has not yet vanished.

15
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:37,712
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 2)"

16
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:41,212
"Principal's office" -I was on campus in the rain?

17
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:42,812
I haven't gone outside at all today.

18
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:43,912
What?

19
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:48,812
Besides, I was at a faculty meeting while it was raining.

20
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:52,312
We were discussing the ghost scare.

21
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,212
By the way, Dr. Araide.

22
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:57,112
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

23
00:02:57,113 --> 00:03:00,612
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

24
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,912
I see.

25
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:03,812
Hey, what on earth is going on?

26
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,512
Don't tell me that the upper classman is lying.

27
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:07,512
No way!

28
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:10,312
She probably mistook someone for him.

29
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,812
Hey.

30
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:13,412
Why don't you ask Kazumi's friend

31
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:16,012
who is resting in the infirmary, then?

32
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,712
The ground is visible from the infirmary because it's right in front,

33
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:21,312
so he may have seen somebody, right?

34
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:23,912
"Infirmary" -No, beats me.

35
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:28,212
After I left you guys, I was asleep in this bed here.

36
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:29,412
Besides...

37
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,712
Take a look.

38
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,712
Even if you were to look outside,

39
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,912
it's virtually impossible to see anything on campus from this floor, right?

40
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:39,912
What kind of garden was the principal thinking of making anyway?

41
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:43,212
So, even if someone suspicious was to be loitering on the ground,

42
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,112
I don't think I would've noticed.

43
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:48,912
By the way, where's the nurse?

44
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,112
She left for the day saying she was going to driving school.

45
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:54,812
She told me to hurry on home and go to bed

46
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,712
because my house is really close to school.

47
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:00,412
After the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

48
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:01,712
is the grudge filled library,

49
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:05,512
the cursed stairs, and now the chair and desk on campus.

50
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,812
Poor Hosaka.

51
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:12,312
I heard that you were childhood friends with Hosaka.

52
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:13,412
Yeah.

53
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,212
I was with him from elementary to Jr. high,

54
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,512
but after we entered high school, I hardly got to see him

55
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,012
because I got into an accident riding my motorbike

56
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,312
as soon as I entered high school,

57
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,512
and was hospitalized for nearly half a year.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,212
Then, you didn't know that he fell down the stairs.

59
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,212
No, not until I was discharged from the hospital

60
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,812
and came back to school.

61
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:35,012
And? Was there anybody who was all worked up over this ghost bit?

62
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,312
Those guys who're making a big thing of this ghost scare

63
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:39,612
are the very ones who probably made this all up

64
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,012
and are having their thrills laughing inside, right?

65
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,612
What? You mean me?

66
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,013
It's possible.

67
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,912
One other person I can think of that was making a fuss over it is

68
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,312
the guy confined in the art room all alone drawing pictures.

69
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:52,712
Don't you think he's suspicious?

70
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:57,212
Even the guy we just saw in the infirmary is just as suspicious.

71
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:01,213
Because the storeroom where the desk was is near the infirmary.

72
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:05,712
Moreover, if you use this slated drain board,

73
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:08,212
you can go directly out to the campus.

74
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,612
Then, the suspicious ones are those two?

75
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,312
Not really. There's one more person.

76
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,412
Kazumi is also to be suspected.

77
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,112
What? Why?

78
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:19,012
Well, if she went to the restroom,

79
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:21,812
it means she left the library, doesn't it?

80
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,212
I guess so.

81
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:26,212
Now that you mentioned it, I wonder why she came

82
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:29,312
when we were checking the storeroom of the gym?

83
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,212
It must've been by chance and besides,

84
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,112
if she did play such a prank,

85
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,612
wouldn't she have left for home?

86
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:36,812
Not really.

87
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:40,812
Before I went out to campus to go to the desk with Dr. Araide,

88
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,012
just a while ago, I went to the shoes box to get my shoes

89
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:46,812
but despite the doorway and the school building being wet with rain,

90
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,712
I saw no footprints.

91
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:51,612
Which means that the person making up the ghost scare is...

92
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,412
Still in the school building somewhere.

93
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:55,612
Yes.

94
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:59,912
If the same person is making up all four ghost scares,

95
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,312
it's extremely likely that this person

96
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,012
knows about the student called Hosaka

97
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,212
who accidentally died two years ago,

98
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,712
as well as know a lot about the scene of the accident.

99
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:12,312
Hardly no one passes through this corridor after school,

100
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:13,812
and moreover, if the teachers were all gathered

101
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,612
in the teacher's room having a conference...

102
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,412
Whether it be from the infirmary on the first floor,

103
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,312
the art room on the second floor

104
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,312
or from the third floor library,

105
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:25,412
the person could secretly without being seen by anyone

106
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:29,413
carry the desk and chair out to campus. It's not impossible.

107
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:33,512
The problem is, how were the desk and chair placed there

108
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:36,812
without leaving any footprints behind, and for what purpose.

109
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,312
There must be something involved.

110
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,113
A reason for causing the ghost scare.

111
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,912
Huh?

112
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:50,112
I wonder what this is on top of the drain board.

113
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:52,212
It looks like traces of someone having splashed water.

114
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,512
I wonder if there were water traces like this

115
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,112
when we passed here a while ago?

116
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:57,713
Don't tell me that...

117
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,212
Conan!

118
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,712
If that's the case,

119
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,013
the traces of it should be somewhere on the campus.

120
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,013
I found it! This is it!

121
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,012
You're not supposed to go outside with slippers.

122
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:18,312
To think that I didn't notice how such an easy trick was carried out...

123
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,512
But this trick can be carried out by any of the three.

124
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:26,112
In order to get the evidence, although it's a bit reckless...

125
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,912
Ran.

126
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,812
Will you all wait for me in front of the art room?

127
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:34,412
I've figured out a way to find out who is doing all this.

128
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,812
What?

129
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,512
"Art room."

130
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:39,012
He's late!

131
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,412
How long does he intend to keep us waiting?

132
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,613
Oh, there he is!

133
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,212
What'd you do?

134
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,712
Oh, some things.

135
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:49,612
I hope we're really going to be able to figure things out here

136
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:52,012
about the culprit of the ghost scare.

137
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,713
Hey, you glasses kid...

138
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:58,412
Hey! I thought I told you not to come inside!

139
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,612
Are you getting ready to go home?

140
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,512
Getting ready to go home?

141
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:06,812
Yeah, I have everything here so that I can go home right away.

142
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,612
Hey there! Sorry to intrude on you.

143
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,313
Seko? What brings you here?

144
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:15,413
This brat told me that if I come here,

145
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:18,612
I'll get to see who the one that's causing the ghost scare is,

146
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,112
so I came.

147
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,512
He said that it may take a while,

148
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:25,612
so I gathered my stuff before coming.

149
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,012
Oh, my.

150
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:28,312
Same here.

151
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:30,912
Kazumi?

152
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,312
Your umbrella's all muddy.

153
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,912
Right.

154
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,512
I was watching the weather forecast this morning

155
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,512
and in my rush, I picked an old umbrella

156
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:40,913
that I used to use when I was a child.

157
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,712
Hey, stop dusting mud off here!

158
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,512
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,712
So? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

160
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,912
Nope. It seems the show's going to start now.

161
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,813
Hey. Are sure everything's going to work out, Conan?

162
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,313
No doubt about it.

163
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:02,565
That one's the culprit.

164
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:11,503
"Art room."

165
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:12,803
And?

166
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:15,903
Where's the one who caused this ghost scare?

167
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:18,303
You said that we'd all find out if we came here, right?

168
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,203
-Conan. -Yes.

169
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:24,103
That ghost scare is rumored to be the doings of the spirit of the person

170
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:27,703
called Hosaka who fell off the stairs two years ago and died, right?

171
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,703
Yes.

172
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:33,503
The stairs is the one near the art room.

173
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:37,503
If so, let's just wait forever very quietly.

174
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,103
Wait for what?

175
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,403
What else...

176
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:45,704
but for the ghost of Mr. Hosaka to come dripping wet down the stairs.

177
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:47,634
Hey!

178
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,435
It hurts!

179
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:54,134
Listen, we're trying to find the bad one

180
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,434
who's trying to make everything look like the doings of the ghost.

181
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:00,934
Mouri. Sorry, but I think I'll head for home.

182
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,435
I guess I will, too.

183
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,934
I'm leaving, too.

184
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,735
I can't possibly concentrate on drawing with you guys around.

185
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,434
It's only starting to get interesting now.

186
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:12,734
Thanks to the glasses kid,

187
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,134
I can't seem to come up with any inspiration.

188
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,935
The fun of it all is disappearing, so I guess...

189
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,335
Sonoko?

190
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,634
Sonoko!

191
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:29,434
Did the usual come?

192
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,934
The usual?

193
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,034
Sonoko is just like my father,

194
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:35,434
doing that when she figures out a case.

195
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,534
No. The way she fell just now was not normal.

196
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,434
Let me check her.

197
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,635
Oh, no!

198
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:45,234
Don't touch me, okay?

199
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,934
Huh?

200
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,434
Because I, deduction queen Sonoko,

201
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,834
is about to start a deduction show now.

202
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,134
So, it came after all.

203
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,234
Yes, I've figured it out

204
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,734
the identity of the one who started all this ghost scare

205
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:00,734
while sneaking and hiding behind the scenes.

206
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,234
As for you, I think you need to hide a bit of something.

207
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,634
What?

208
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:08,134
Talk about showing it all!

209
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,635
Sonoko, your panty's showing!

210
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,734
Oh, my! I'm sorry!

211
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,034
Since I've figured out the truth,

212
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:17,234
I seem to have gone weak and relaxed a bit too much.

213
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,235
Gosh.

214
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:22,334
Because it turned out to such a simple trick.

215
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:23,534
Simple?

216
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:25,234
Then, you've figured it out?

217
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,634
The mystery of the desk and chair put out on campus

218
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,534
without leaving any footprints.

219
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:34,134
The piece of paper on the desk was not wet at all.

220
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,534
Right, that piece of paper.

221
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,734
I was thrown off by the paper that wasn't wet at all

222
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:41,434
and had completely forgotten about something.

223
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,634
Even if the desk and chair were carried out while it was raining,

224
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:48,134
the footprints would be erased by the rain.

225
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:51,334
The footprints may disappear,

226
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,634
but won't the piece of paper on the desk also get wet?

227
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:57,734
If you don't want to get wet, what would you do, Ran?

228
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,934
Well, I'll wait somewhere until it stops raining.

229
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:03,334
Or wear a raincoat.

230
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:04,935
Or...

231
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:07,734
You mean...

232
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:08,934
Right.

233
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,634
All the culprit did was cover the paper,

234
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,534
so that it wouldn't get wet,

235
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,534
using an umbrella with a long string attached to it.

236
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,934
After it stops raining,

237
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,234
the string attached to the umbrella is pulled

238
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,234
and the umbrella is retrieved to the school building.

239
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,634
This way, no footprints are left behind on the wet, muddy campus

240
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:26,934
and the piece of paper is still dry.

241
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,634
The traces were clearly left behind on campus.

242
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:33,534
The traces of the tip of the frame of the umbrella touching the ground

243
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,434
when the string was pulled to take the umbrella in.

244
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:38,234
On the drain board that is placed from the campus grounds

245
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,834
to the entrance of the school building,

246
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,034
there were traces of water being splattered.

247
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,534
This serves as yet another evidence.

248
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,134
The water that was splattered there was from the umbrella

249
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,534
that was retrieved and shook to shake off excess water.

250
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:51,634
But that's not enough to shake off all the rain water.

251
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:55,534
The more time passes, the more water sinks in.

252
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,334
Then, the person who caused the ghost scare was...

253
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,134
-Could it possibly be... -Yes, that's right.

254
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,934
The culprit is the one who owns the umbrella

255
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:05,134
that has rain water flowing out of it.

256
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:08,134
You, Kunishige Seko!

257
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,034
You were sleeping in the infirmary

258
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:11,834
saying that you weren't feeling good

259
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:15,134
just to carry out this trick.

260
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,034
The weather forecast said that there would be a shower

261
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,134
from around noon to sundown,

262
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:22,534
but you didn't know exactly what time it would be.

263
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,334
You carried the desk and chair that were in the storeroom of the gym

264
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:28,334
out to the campus grounds secretly,

265
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,234
covered the desk with an umbrella with string attached to it

266
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,434
and went back to the infirmary for the time being.

267
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,434
All you had to do now is wait for it to stop raining

268
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:37,834
pull the string and retrieve the umbrella.

269
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:42,434
But, what if someone saw the umbrella on the desk?

270
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,534
The campus ground cannot be seen from the first floor

271
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:46,634
because the trees are in the way,

272
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,434
and if viewed from the 2nd and 3rd floor,

273
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,734
it would just look as if someone is standing in place

274
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:52,334
in the rain with an umbrella.

275
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:55,834
Then, do you mean that the principal I saw was...

276
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,934
You just made a mistake because the color of the umbrella

277
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,534
was the same as the one the principal who used to go out

278
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,234
into the grounds everyday had.

279
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,834
Hey. You're going to call me the culprit

280
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:06,334
just because my umbrella was wet?

281
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,034
Since my umbrella was really dirty,

282
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:12,134
I washed it off at the faucet just a while ago, that's why it was wet.

283
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:13,934
Besides, if it's a trick like that,

284
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:17,134
Monobe and Tsukamoto could've done it too, right?

285
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,534
No, you're the one.

286
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:22,534
It's interesting that if you are the one,

287
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:25,534
the answers to all the other ghost scares fall into place.

288
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,334
The library of grudge, the cursed stairs,

289
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,734
and the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

290
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,134
that is, the three ghostly phenomenon!

291
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,334
First for the library of grudge,

292
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:35,734
where the four books that Hosaka had borrowed,

293
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,134
being left out without being put away for 4 consecutive days.

294
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:41,534
But, isn't that something that anybody could've done?

295
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,234
If you look at the library card,

296
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,734
you can get the names of the people who borrowed the book in the past.

297
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,934
Do you remember the title of the four books?

298
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,634
The title?

299
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:52,734
I think it was electric, something...

300
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,834
"Theory of Telecommunication".

301
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:57,034
"Report of the Destruction of Tropical Rainforests".

302
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,834
"The History of the University System".

303
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,034
"Analysis of Rock Destruction Sound".

304
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,234
No ordinary person could search and find these four books

305
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:06,334
that virtually no one would bother to touch at all.

306
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,134
But, you, Mr. Seko, was his childhood friend

307
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,734
and knew his hobbies very well.

308
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,534
Then, what about the cursed stairs?

309
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:17,434
So you're saying Seko is responsible

310
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,234
for the bottom of the stairs being wet?

311
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:24,034
Yes. Isn't there a hole there where the extinguisher is kept?

312
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:27,034
Mr. Seko probably got ice ready

313
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,334
and hid it behind the fire extinguisher after school.

314
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,734
The following morning,

315
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:33,534
he wanted someone to find the water soaked floor

316
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:36,334
because of the melted ice, which he prepared during the night.

317
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,534
That's why you put wax on the floor right below the dent, right?

318
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:42,934
You used the wax as a water repellent,

319
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:45,734
so that it wouldn't look as if water flowed out from the dent.

320
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,934
Mr. Seko, whose house is near the school

321
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,734
is the only one who could've done something like this.

322
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,134
I see.

323
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:54,834
He went home to get the ice after school.

324
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,434
But, why?

325
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,334
Why would you, who used to be Hosaka's childhood friend

326
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,434
do something like this?

327
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,834
Depending on your answer, you're going to get it!

328
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:04,334
The whole thing probably started

329
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,235
with the wailing in the storeroom of the gym.

330
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,834
The wailing that the students

331
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,334
who came for early morning practice heard

332
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,734
was Mr. Seko's voice.

333
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,934
If Mr. Seko's ping-pong club also had early morning practice that day,

334
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,534
it's natural that he would be in the storeroom of the gym.

335
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:24,234
Maybe he noticed Mr. Hosaka's desk and chair for the first time that day,

336
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:26,734
it's not strange to think that.

337
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,534
Mr. Hosaka's death was no accident.

338
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:30,934
Yeah, that's right.

339
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,134
It dawned on me right away

340
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,934
that Hosaka was bullied and killed

341
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:37,335
while I was in the hospital!

342
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:40,434
You mentioned just a while ago,

343
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:41,534
that I knew what kind of books he would borrow

344
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,734
because I was his childhood friend, right?

345
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,734
Actually, that's not it.

346
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:49,834
Those four books were the books that Hosaka brought with him

347
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:52,134
when he came to visit me everyday at the hospital.

348
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,834
In order to cheer me up,

349
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:59,434
he told me about the funny and interesting stories he made up

350
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,234
after reading those books.

351
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,434
But he suddenly stopped coming.

352
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:06,034
I thought that maybe he found a girl he liked or something.

353
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,234
I didn't think he had died of an accident.

354
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,334
After being discharged from the hospital,

355
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:10,434
I investigated on his accident,

356
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:13,634
but all I found out was that he fell from the stairs.

357
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,734
That is, until I found his desk with his signature

358
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,334
on it in the storeroom of the gym!

359
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,434
That's why I wanted to find

360
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,934
the one who hid his desk into the storeroom.

361
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:28,834
I wanted to find the one who pushed him off the stairs!

362
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:30,534
Wrong.

363
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:33,534
Hosaka didn't fall off the stairs, nor was he bullied.

364
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:34,834
I'm to blame!

365
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,234
What?

366
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,734
That day, early in the morning,

367
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:42,134
two stone statues were scheduled to be delivered to school.

368
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:45,434
Both Hosaka and I were weekly monitors that day,

369
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,434
so we secretly carried the two statues

370
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,134
to the art room early in the morning.

371
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,734
We were planning to place the statues by the door

372
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,535
to surprise the art teacher.

373
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:58,034
But because we were rushing to set up the statues

374
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,534
before the teacher arrives,

375
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:02,234
we went past the 2nd floor art room to the 3rd floor.

376
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,334
Since Hosaka told me this, I rushed to turn back

377
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,135
and tripped.

378
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:16,934
Hosaka tried to protect me from falling

379
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,434
and was crushed by me and the statue.

380
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,334
That's why Hosaka wasn't being bullied.

381
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,034
That's a lie!

382
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,034
Then, why was his desk put in a dimly lit place like that

383
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,934
and covered with dust?

384
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:31,034
-No matter how you look at it... -We didn't want to erase the signs

385
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:35,334
that Hosaka was coming to the same school as we were.

386
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,934
His signature was written in pencil,

387
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,334
so if left as it would've rubbed off eventually, right?

388
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,734
After the accident,

389
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:44,434
the drawings of the faces of all his classmates

390
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:47,434
was found in his notebook, so we got sad

391
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,934
and asked the teacher a favor.

392
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,034
That is, to put his desk out in one of the classrooms

393
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:54,434
on the day of our graduation,

394
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:57,734
so that he can graduate together with us.

395
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:00,534
At first, the teacher gave a sour look,

396
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,234
but we asked the teacher to let us

397
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,634
keep the desk and chair in the storeroom of the gym

398
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:06,434
after the class collected enough money to buy them.

399
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:09,134
We should've told you about it too,

400
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,634
but we found out that you were childhood friends with Hosaka

401
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:15,134
only after the ghost scare.

402
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,334
I see.

403
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:19,034
That's why you were at the storeroom back then.

404
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,035
Yes.

405
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:25,134
I thought maybe Seko might be where Hosaka's desk was.

406
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,434
Then...

407
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:31,534
he wasn't bullied or had a grudge on anybody.

408
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:32,734
No.

409
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,234
If anybody, I'm the only one he'd have a grudge against.

410
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,034
After all, I'm the one who thought up that stupid prank, too.

411
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,634
No.

412
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:42,534
I'm sure he holds no grudge against you.

413
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:46,434
Well, I was the first one to be called to the site of the accident.

414
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,134
Back then, he kept mumbling.

415
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,234
That maybe the teacher will be even more surprised

416
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,835
if he fell to the ground as is.

417
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,135
Just as expected of him.

418
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:29,935
Just as expected of you, Sonoko!

419
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:33,834
Your deduction was superb as always.

420
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,034
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:38,135
I don't remember, though, like always.

422
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:42,334
But what a surprise it was to hear that Dr. Araide

423
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,534
heard the last words spoken by that student.

424
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:46,934
Oh, well...

425
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:50,334
The truth is, he was in no condition to talk at all.

426
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,734
But I figured at that time, it was best to say so,

427
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:55,434
to make those seniors feel relieved.

428
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:56,934
I couldn't help lying.

429
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,534
I see.

430
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,634
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

431
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:02,635
Huh?

432
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:05,834
Well, what a relief that there were no ghosts.

433
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:08,734
Yes! I won't have to worry about being monitor next week anymore!

434
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:11,734
Okay! Maybe I'll go talk to the newspaper club about my deduction

435
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,234
-and give them a scoop article! -I think you shouldn't do anything.

436
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,634
There'll be no ghost scares anymore.

437
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,635
Besides, rumors vanish with time.

438
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,034
I'm sorry. I've got an important phone call.

439
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,034
We'll be on our way then.

440
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:31,435
Goodbye, Dr. Araide!

441
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,434
Hello?

442
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,535
Yes, Araide here.

443
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,534
Really? I'm happy for you

444
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,934
that you got yourself smoothly into school

445
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:46,034
without anyone being suspicious.

446
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,134
Yes, thanks to you.

447
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,334
Since you told me

448
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:54,434
how the imposter was going around in school.

449
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:57,534
Then, this is the last time I'll be calling you.

450
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:00,334
Forget me completely.

451
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,934
Wait! There's one thing I'd like to ask you.

452
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:06,534
The person who was disguised as me...

453
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:10,134
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always.

454
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:11,534
Was that person really...

455
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:16,534
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

456
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:20,034
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

457
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:23,034
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

458
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,534
Was that person really...

459
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,435
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

460
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:31,635
A bad person?

461
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:36,834
Every time I get in touch with the students or teachers at school,

462
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:38,534
he just doesn't seem to be a bad person.

463
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:39,634
What a fool!

464
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,534
A person who can smile when killing someone

465
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:43,735
can never be a good person!

466
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,934
Yes. All that woman did was trace your personality

467
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:53,534
in order to become your imposter.

468
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,335
And she did so frighteningly accurately.

469
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:59,235
That's all.

470
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:05,935
"Next Episode."

471
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:26,035
No, there's got to be a way.

472
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:32,235
Next Conan, "City Crows".

473
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,434
Next Conan's Hint:

474
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,834
"Lottery."

475
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:53,034
City crows resemble...

476
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,534
-Information society. -Why do you say that?

477
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,334
Problems of scattered trash are resolved by the net.

478
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:57,435
I see.
