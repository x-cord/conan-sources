1
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:06,221
You're in good hands, leave everything to me.

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,921
I, Kogoro Mouri will give you my word

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:13,721
that I will nab the burglar who broke into your house, Junko.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,121
I hope you don't get your hand dirty, though.

5
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,821
"Junko Miyoshi (26), Client" -I'm counting on you, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,221
Just the other day,

7
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:23,621
a jewelry shop near the station was robbed, right?

8
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:25,922
That's why I'm really scared.

9
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,421
All right then, Junko,

10
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:32,121
I can spend the night over at your place from tonight.

11
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,021
No, that won't be necessary.

12
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:36,822
My boyfriend's supposed to be coming over.

13
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,721
Your boyfriend?

14
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,521
That's good to hear.

15
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:44,221
So, please nab the burglar

16
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,721
as soon as you possibly can, Mr. Mouri.

17
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,721
Of course, my pleasure.

18
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,322
He's been brushed off.

19
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:55,121
There was a bug on your head, a bug...

20
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,222
He heard me.

21
00:00:57,022 --> 00:01:00,121
Thank you so much

22
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:02,421
for seeing me home.

23
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:03,521
No problem.

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,222
Walking alone at night is dangerous.

25
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,221
I wonder what it is?

26
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,522
It seems to have come from the parking lot of the condo.

27
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,222
What seems to be the matter?

28
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:22,522
Over there...

29
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,221
Mr. Mouri, what on earth?

30
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,321
Junko, please stay back.

31
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,621
And please contact the police right away.

32
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:33,722
All right.

33
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:36,422
Mr. Kitagami?

34
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:39,821
Do you know him?

35
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:43,221
Yes. He lives next door to me.

36
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,522
Mr. Mouri. How's Mr. Kitagami?

37
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:48,321
From the looks of it,

38
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,822
he's already...

39
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:07,921
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

40
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:10,121
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

41
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,021
While discussing theft prevention,

42
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:14,321
the neighbor experiences a strange fall.

43
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:16,021
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:18,321
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:20,822
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:54,481
"Security System Pitfall"

47
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,580
"Naotsugu Kitagami (32)" -The victim is Mr. Naotsugu Kitagami,

48
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,080
"Company Employee" -age 32.

49
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,180
He's a company worker who lives in room 704 of this condo.

50
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,780
The cause of his death is most likely brain contusion

51
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:12,080
caused by a strong blow to his head.

52
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,680
There were many scratches on the front part of the body,

53
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,681
so most likely...

54
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:19,281
He most likely fell to his death.

55
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,380
Mr. Mouri.

56
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,880
His body smells of alcohol.

57
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,180
I think he got wasted,

58
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:30,580
slipped on the veranda and fell over the railing.

59
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,881
Pops.

60
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:37,480
There's a weird smell mixed in with the smell of alcohol.

61
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,180
He smells kind of like peppers.

62
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:42,580
Never mind, just stay with Junko, will you?

63
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,680
Okay.

64
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,380
Come to think of it, the girl that was with you, who is she?

65
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:47,580
Well...

66
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:50,080
We're not in any sort of intimate relationship.

67
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,980
That's not my question.

68
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:55,180
She's one of the victims of the burglaries

69
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,580
that have been occurring recently in this neighborhood.

70
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,980
She called me to discuss this problem,

71
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,380
so I came and ended seeing this incident.

72
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,580
It turned out that she coincidentally

73
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:08,680
happened to live next door to the victim, Mr. Kitagami.

74
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,280
I see.

75
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,980
Inspector, I think we should start heading over to the room of the victim.

76
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,480
Right.

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,580
Go get the manager of the condo then.

78
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:18,680
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,280
Officer Chiba!

80
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,480
We're going up to the victim's room!

81
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,581
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,981
This way please.

83
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,880
He has a private security camera.

84
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,180
And...

85
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:39,780
he's even registered with a security company.

86
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:42,880
It seems he was a very cautious character.

87
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:43,881
Yes.

88
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,680
What seems to be the matter?

89
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,081
The lock's open.

90
00:05:55,681 --> 00:06:00,780
It seems that he just carelessly forgot to lock the front door.

91
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,280
The security system is turned off

92
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:07,080
and the key to the house is hanging here too.

93
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:11,380
Inspector, I guess the victim was drunk after all.

94
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,881
He seemed to be totally wasted.

95
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,481
Inspector Megure.

96
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,681
There are liquor bottles on the veranda too.

97
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,080
I guess it's just as I deduced.

98
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,980
But, why did the victim come out to the veranda?

99
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:32,580
I guess he wanted to cool down his body that got hot.

100
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:33,980
And...

101
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,680
he tripped over the liquor bottles,

102
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:39,580
lost his balance and fell over the railing.

103
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:43,180
And fell upside to the ground.

104
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:45,481
I see.

105
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,180
Officer Takagi and Chiba.

106
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,180
Just in case, can you two split up

107
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,980
and ask around the neighborhood for information?

108
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:00,181
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

109
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,781
Thank you for your cooperation.

110
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:10,480
"Sawada"

111
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:11,580
Yes.

112
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:14,180
Excuse me, I'm from the police,

113
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,980
could I ask you some questions?

114
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,381
Please wait for a while.

115
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm sorry to be intruding on you.

116
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,080
"Ryosuke Sawada (30)" -I thought something was noisy

117
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,080
"Ryosuke Sawada (30)" -below in the parking lot.

118
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,680
Is something wrong?

119
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,880
Do you know Mr. Naotsugu Kitagami of Room 704?

120
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,180
Yes, I know at least what he looks like.

121
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:39,580
Mr. Kitagami was found dead in the parking lot.

122
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:40,980
Seriously?

123
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,380
Do you know something?

124
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,080
I stayed home all day today

125
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,280
but I didn't notice anything in particular.

126
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,680
I see.

127
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:53,380
Was your room burglarized, sir?

128
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,680
Conan?

129
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,180
What's with this brat?

130
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,580
Well...

131
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:03,180
There's a scratch on the keyhole of the door,

132
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,781
so I thought that maybe...

133
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:06,881
Really?

134
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,980
True.

135
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,880
Maybe it's just a prank.

136
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,180
Nothing was stolen either.

137
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:17,880
Please check carefully once more.

138
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,180
And if you find something suspicious...

139
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,780
Then,

140
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,481
Will you show us the veranda of your room?

141
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,481
Do you mind if we check your veranda?

142
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,180
Did you find anything?

143
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,080
No, nothing in particular.

144
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:56,581
Thank you for your cooperation.

145
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,080
Conan, let's go.

146
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,081
What's the matter?

147
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,880
I have to use the restroom.

148
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,581
I was holding it from some time ago.

149
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm sorry but could he use your restroom?

150
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:13,780
Go ahead. Its...

151
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,981
I'm fine. I know.

152
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,080
Conan, here we are.

153
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,381
I'm sorry. I was thinking of something.

154
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,381
Inspector Megure, I'm back.

155
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,180
Is something wrong?

156
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:40,580
We found the perpetrator.

157
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,880
The perpetrator? Wasn't this an accident?

158
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,380
Yeah, no...

159
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,580
That's not it.

160
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:51,280
This necklace seems to be Mrs. Miyosh's but...

161
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,980
My boyfriend bought it for me when we were abroad,

162
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,180
so there's no mistake about it.

163
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:57,980
What about it?

164
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,380
That necklace came out from this room.

165
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,980
What? Then, don't tell me that...

166
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:09,580
Yeah. In other words the perpetrator who burglarized this area

167
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,580
is a resident of this room got drunk,

168
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,480
and fell to his death from the veranda.

169
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,181
His name was Naotsugu Kitagami!

170
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:23,580
And how did the interrogation go, Officer Takagi?

171
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,780
Well...

172
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,580
We didn't get a hold of any useful information.

173
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:28,880
I see.

174
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,380
So just as Mr. Mouri said,

175
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,580
he got drunk and fell to his death.

176
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,081
The case is settled.

177
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,680
I see, I get the picture.

178
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,081
This is not a mere death fall case.

179
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,292
About the stolen objects and burglary,

180
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,992
we'll have the 3rd investigation department contact you immediately.

181
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:55,392
Thank you.

182
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,793
Have a good day, then.

183
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:02,192
What an unexpected conclusion, don't you think?

184
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,992
That the person who happened to fall to his death

185
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,792
was coincidentally a burglar.

186
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,192
I guess so.

187
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,192
All that's left is how do we prove it.

188
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:13,692
What're you doing, Mr. Mouri?

189
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,493
Well, I was just...

190
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,392
I was looking at my own reflection

191
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:20,693
and wanted to prim up a bit.

192
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,692
This wall sure is shiny like a mirror.

193
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:29,892
That's because it's UV coated.

194
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,092
It's quick trying and glossy,

195
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,993
so is often used in elevators.

196
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:41,692
What's the matter, Conan?

197
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:45,892
Maybe I dropped the detective badge...

198
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,692
I had in my pocket.

199
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:51,292
Do you have an idea where you dropped it?

200
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,293
Well...

201
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,792
I think I dropped it in Room 604, Mr. Sawada's room.

202
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,492
May I go get it?

203
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:00,593
Of course.

204
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:08,592
What's up? Go and get quick.

205
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:11,392
Aren't you coming with me, Pops?

206
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:14,592
Why do I have to go with you?

207
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,793
I don't want to go alone.

208
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:21,392
You always go everywhere on your own.

209
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,592
What's the problem, Mr. Mouri?

210
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,892
Just go along with him.

211
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,992
Gosh, come on let's go!

212
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:29,593
Thanks, Pops.

213
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,092
"Sawada"

214
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,292
I'm so sorry.

215
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,792
It's okay,

216
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,392
but once you find what you're looking for,

217
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:38,392
leave right away, will you?

218
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,992
Yes, of course.

219
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,392
Hey, did you find what you're looking for?

220
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:46,792
Not yet... Strange.

221
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:48,292
Gosh...

222
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:49,592
Are you sure you lost it here?

223
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:50,793
I found it!

224
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,192
Let's go if you found it.

225
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,193
Okay.

226
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,892
The door's that way.

227
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,293
We're sorry to have intruded on you.

228
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:07,692
Hey, hey.

229
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,392
What kind of joke is this?

230
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:10,592
Hey!

231
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,393
What are you getting all comfy for?

232
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,693
Yes.

233
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:18,992
Detectives...

234
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,392
Excuse me.

235
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:24,892
Mr. Mouri asked us to come up here.

236
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,492
Good timing.

237
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,893
Will you do something about him?

238
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,892
Mr. Mouri, what are you doing in his room?

239
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,192
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:39,092
I fell asleep while waiting for you to come up.

241
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,392
And? What is it you want?

242
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:49,092
It bothered me that Mr. Kitagami who was so into security measures

243
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,892
forgot to lock his front door.

244
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:54,592
But, people sometimes do forget to lock their doors, don't they?

245
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:56,892
But, he was a burglar.

246
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,392
There was proof of that in his room too.

247
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:02,592
I wonder if a person like him can be so careless?

248
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,392
And, the way his body was found also is of concern.

249
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:08,192
The way his body was found?

250
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:11,492
Officer Takagi, when you drink at home,

251
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:13,392
how do you dress?

252
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,692
How?

253
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,392
Do you wear your suit and necktie?

254
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:18,893
No way.

255
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:25,492
Right. Mr. Kitagami's corpse was wearing a suit and tie

256
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:28,992
despite drinking at home.

257
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,792
But, Mr. Mouri...

258
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,792
The liquor bottle that was found in the room

259
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,492
was something from some while ago,

260
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,792
-so it's thinkable that he drank elsewhere. -That's not possible.

261
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:42,192
The beer that was found in the glass cup of Mr. Kitagami's room

262
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,692
still had some foam in it.

263
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,992
Which means, that maybe the beer was poured into the glass

264
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,093
just a while before we went into the room.

265
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:53,892
It's true that it's odd.

266
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,792
But what's even odder is you, getting all comfy in this room.

267
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,992
What on earth are you getting at?

268
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:03,092
Of course I'm trying to solve the case

269
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:06,992
of Mr. Ryosuke Sawada, who is the resident of this room

270
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,093
having killed Mr. Kitagami.

271
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,192
What?

272
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:15,392
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,892
Mr. Mouri. Just what're you talking about?

274
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,492
Mr. Kitagami got drunk,

275
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:24,492
tripped over the liquor bottle and fell off the veranda of his room.

276
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,892
Yeah, that's what you said.

277
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,592
There were scrape marks all over the body of the corpse.

278
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:36,192
But, there were no scratches on his veranda that matched those marks.

279
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:38,592
Isn't that because the scratches found on him

280
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:41,492
were scrapes made when he fell to the ground?

281
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:45,092
Officer Takagi, please check the veranda of this room.

282
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:46,992
There should be scratch marks.

283
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:47,993
Yes, sir!

284
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,492
Mr. Mouri, yes, there are!

285
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,592
New scrape marks.

286
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,492
Mr. Sawada, after killing Mr. Kitagami,

287
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:07,692
you probably tried to throw him over your veranda.

288
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:12,192
But, it's not easy throwing someone over.

289
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:15,292
That's why in order to throw Mr. Kitagami over the veranda,

290
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,792
you carried him up to the railing once.

291
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,792
When you did so, the buckle of Mr. Kitagami's belt

292
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:24,092
rubbed against the railing and scratched it.

293
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,692
And of course, you'll scrape marks on Mr. Kitagami's belt buckle too.

294
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:30,892
Then, you lifted his legs up and dropped him slowly.

295
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:34,793
That's when he got scrape marks all over the front part of his body.

296
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:38,392
How rude can you get?

297
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,892
Barging in like this

298
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,692
then saying that I'm a murderer?

299
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:45,692
The guy called Kitagami fell off his own veranda, right?

300
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:49,392
It could be that he scraped his body against the wall of this veranda

301
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:50,992
when he went falling, no?

302
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:55,392
Besides, in the first place, why do I have to kill him?

303
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,092
I never even really talked to him too.

304
00:16:58,093 --> 00:16:59,492
Motive...

305
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:01,592
Mr. Mouri, how about it?

306
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:05,392
Mr. Kitagami was a burglar.

307
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:10,293
And there are traces of this door having been picked.

308
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:13,492
Then, don't tell me that...

309
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:17,792
Yes, he burglarized this room.

310
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,992
And coincidentally ran into you

311
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:22,292
when you came home.

312
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:25,792
Are you saying that he happened to run into the burgler in his place

313
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:28,492
and inadvertently killed him?

314
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:29,692
Yes.

315
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:31,392
But, Mr. Mouri...

316
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:36,492
Why didn't Mr. Sawada report it to the police or flee?

317
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:40,192
What if it's not that he didn't but rather couldn't?

318
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,792
He couldn't?

319
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,292
Why not?

320
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,593
I think I know why.

321
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,392
When I borrowed the restroom here,

322
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:52,892
there was a big bag shoved into the cabinet.

323
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,992
-You brat! -Come, come, now...

324
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:58,092
Officer Takagi, will you bring that bag over here.

325
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,292
Yes, sir!

326
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:01,293
You don't mind, do you?

327
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,292
Inspector Megure.

328
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,192
Just as Conan said, the bag was there.

329
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:08,493
And the contents?

330
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:11,993
What?

331
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,092
This is...

332
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,792
Mr. Sawada, excuse me

333
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,992
but you don't look to be someone who would have enough money

334
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:21,392
to own valuable things like these.

335
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,592
What on earth are these?

336
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,093
How about it?

337
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,492
Oh, right.

338
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:30,892
Those valuables are the ones that I robbed!

339
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:35,492
Mr. Kitagami, who broke in here found these valuables

340
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:37,992
so you killed to shut him up.

341
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,692
Wrong!

342
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,092
It's true that I panicked when he found them

343
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,492
but I made a deal with him.

344
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:44,692
A deal?

345
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:47,392
Since he found the valuables,

346
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,992
I gave him a piece.

347
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:52,292
With that we decided that I would forget

348
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:55,392
about the fact that he was a burglar

349
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:58,692
and he would forget that I was a robber. Then, he left.

350
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:02,892
I know nothing about him falling to his death!

351
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,292
Enough with delusive stories!

352
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:11,092
Mr. Mouri, I hope your deduction is based on proof.

353
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,892
Of course. Besides the valuables,

354
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:17,692
there is pepper spray in that bag.

355
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:20,392
I guess you used it when robbing.

356
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,192
Mr. Kitagami's eyelids were red and swollen,

357
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,792
not because of the liquor

358
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,793
but because pepper spray was used on him.

359
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,692
That won't serve as proof.

360
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,092
Mr. Mouri.

361
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:35,292
I borrowed what you asked for from forensics.

362
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:38,792
Good. Conan, please help me.

363
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:39,893
Okay!

364
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:45,393
Officer Takagi, may borrow that?

365
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,393
Yeah.

366
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,892
When using this type of spray,

367
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:54,893
it sprays a bit on the user too.

368
00:19:56,193 --> 00:20:00,392
Since the fluid's transparent, it's hard to tell.

369
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:01,892
Don't worry.

370
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:04,592
UV coating is used in pepper sprays

371
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:09,892
so that the perpetrator who flees can be pursued!

372
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:13,992
So Officer Chiba, will you turn off the light of the room?

373
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:14,993
Yeah.

374
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:20,592
Officer Chiba, can you shine the black light on my hand

375
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,493
and Conan's clothes?

376
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,992
See?

377
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,892
I see.

378
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,592
Which means...

379
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:36,592
If Mr. Sawada's sleeve glows like Conan's clothes...

380
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,593
Excuse me.

381
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:44,793
How about it? Do you still insist you didn't do it?

382
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,792
He said that he changed his mind

383
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,793
and suddenly demanded to have all the valuables.

384
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:56,992
He overwhelmingly came at me

385
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:00,692
so I impulsively sprayed him with the pepper spray that was in the bag.

386
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,992
He squirmed around because it stung,

387
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,192
his feet tripped over the table

388
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:07,992
and he hit his head on the corner of the shelf.

389
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:11,192
He barged in here on his own and died on his own!

390
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:14,292
Why do I have to take responsibility for this?

391
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:17,192
Since I realized he lived right above me,

392
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,492
I figured it wouldn't look unnatural

393
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,692
even if I dropped him from this veranda.

394
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,692
Besides, I had the key to his room too.

395
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:27,292
You tried to cover up your crime.

396
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:29,292
You idiot!

397
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,992
On top of robbing jewels,

398
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,392
you threw Mr. Kitagami off the veranda

399
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:37,192
and tried to use childish measures to cover up your crime.

400
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:39,193
Do you understand the seriousness of the crime you committed?

401
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,593
Darn.

402
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,493
Darn!

403
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:14,592
It's about time you get up, Mr. Mouri.

404
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,593
We're leaving.

405
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,893
Where am I?

406
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:32,392
My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

407
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:35,392
Something's on my hand...

408
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:36,792
Your deduction was superb,

409
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:39,092
but how unsightly of you now.

410
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,993
You've got to take care of your eyes.

411

"Next Episode" -Koji Haneda.

412
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,992
Shards of glass?

413
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,792
There's a pattern and letters on it.

414
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,192
It probably spelt...

415
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,092
"Put On Mascara".

416
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,692
So what?

417
00:23:56,693 --> 00:24:00,092
Are you saying that I'm the one who did it?

418
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,992
I'd like to go

419
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:06,093
to the crime site too.

420
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:08,692
