1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,320
I was checking on the connection between Kir of the Black Organization,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,020
the new student who transferred from another school to Ran's class.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,020
I found out that Eisuke's father

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,620
was hired at a place called "the Company".

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,120
And that Eisuke was looking for his older sister

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,220
who had left home ten years ago,

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,020
that looked exactly like Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,820
Is Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi,

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,720
one and the same person?

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,620
We went to visit Mr. Anno

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,920
who happened to be a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
We came to see you, sir.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,720
We've got a favor to ask you.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,320
We want you to take a look at the picture of this woman!

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,120
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,720
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,920
Eisuke Hondo looks for his older sister with all his might.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,520
An unexpected truth is revealed through blood types.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,020
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,620
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,020
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:48,996
"Red and Black Crash: Kin."

24
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:53,096
"Anno."

25
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,271
No matter what angle I look at her from,

26
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,871
she looks like none other than Rena when she was young.

27
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,346
You think so too, don't you? Don't you?

28
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,371
Then maybe she's your older sister after all, Eisuke.

29
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,171
Huh? Are you Rena's younger brother?

30
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,571
Come to think of it, you have her eyes!

31
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,971
Could you get me her autograph?

32
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:20,771
Oh, but I think that the announcer called Rena Mizunashi

33
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,271
and sis are two different people.

34
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,671
He's looking for his older sister who left home,

35
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,771
that's her in this picture, you see!

36
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:30,071
I'm sure it's her, then!

37
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,571
I'm a great fan of hers and I would never make a mistake!

38
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,271
But...

39
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,871
Come to think of it, when Rena first came on TV,

40
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,471
she had a hair style very similar to that of this woman.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,271
Maybe watching a video of back then may help?

42
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:49,471
This is a recording of the news program that made her popular.

43
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,871
Well, take a look at it.

44
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,771
This is an image taken from the air.

45
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,571
The scene sure looks like a battlefield!

46
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:57,671
This chemical plant suddenly exploded.

47
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,671
Although it is still unconfirmed,

48
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,971
there seems to be a number of over 100 casualties.

49
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,871
The victims are being moved into

50
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,571
a hospital nearby one after the other.

51
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,971
This disastrous incident occurred while we, at Nichiuri TV

52
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,271
were conducting an interview here.

53
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,971
I was also slightly injured myself because of the explosion...

54
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,371
Excuse me!

55
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,771
Is there anyone here that is blood type AB,

56
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,671
any AB blood type people around?

57
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,071
We don't have enough blood.

58
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,371
Is there anyone with blood type AB?

59
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:22,271
I'm sorry, I have blood type AB, so I've got to go!

60
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,571
What, Rena?

61
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,671
Oh, I'm blood type AB!

62
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:30,871
My, you're hurt too.

63
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,771
Yes, but I've got a lot of hot blood.

64
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:36,171
I see, please come inside with me.

65
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:39,871
Did you see that? She's hurt herself, and yet she has the kindness

66
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,371
to offer her blood to someone else!

67
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,371
That's not easy to do, right?

68
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,071
No, it's not.

69
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:49,471
The fact is, she was at this plant doing an interview,

70
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:52,371
and had a bad wound that required several stitches herself.

71
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:54,771
That's why after she gave blood for blood transfusion,

72
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,771
she went faint and had to receive transfusion herself.

73
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,071
Cute try, don't you think?

74
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,871
I'm completely recovered now.

75
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:10,071
How about it, Eisuke? She's not your older sister?

76
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:12,371
-No, she isn't! -Huh, why not?

77
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,171
Go on, and take a closer look at her!

78
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:17,171
It's not her, I'm telling you it's not her.

79
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,871
If what his older sister said...

80
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:24,371
Your blood type is one that you can give to everybody.

81
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,871
If what she said is true,

82
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,771
his blood type is the only blood type

83
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:29,571
that can be given to anyone.

84
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,171
Blood type, O.

85
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,571
Normally, blood of the same type is used for transfusions,

86
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,471
but when there is a need for a large amount of blood transfusion

87
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:40,171
or in a life or death situation and blood is needed right away,

88
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,171
no matter what blood type the person is,

89
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,771
blood type O is used.

90
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,671
The situation in the video just now, was just that.

91
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,171
But, O blood type people

92
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:52,071
can only receive from other O blood type people.

93
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,671
If he received blood from his older sister in the past,

94
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,971
his sister should've also been blood type O.

95
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,471
However, the woman in the video

96
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,171
declared that she was blood type AB.

97
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,671
Moreover, she received blood transfusion herself later on too.

98
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,271
If she were actually blood type O,

99
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,771
and for some reason lied saying that she was blood type AB,

100
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:11,071
she can give blood to a person who is blood type AB,

101
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,871
but she cannot receive that blood type!

102
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,271
In other words,

103
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,571
Rena Mizunashi and the woman in the picture are two different people.

104
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,871
Then, the reason he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

105
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,471
is not because she's his older sister.

106
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,571
But, rather, it's because she looks exactly like his older sister.

107
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:30,271
"Haido Central Hospital."

108
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,371
A young man who has an older sister

109
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,371
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi.

110
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,471
Yep. It seems as if he found out that Rena Mizunashi

111
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,071
was hurt badly in that incident in the past.

112
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:46,371
Now he's going around to various hospitals looking for her.

113
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:50,071
So, he may just show up at that hospital.

114
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:53,171
Okay! So you want me to work it out, right?

115
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,371
Don't worry!

116
00:06:54,371 --> 00:07:00,371
Only a few doctors and nurses are aware that she's here.

117
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,271
But what a surprise that.

118
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,571
Rena Mizunashi had a younger brother.

119
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:07,571
No, Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo's older sister

120
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,871
are two different people!

121
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,071
They have different blood types.

122
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,471
Huh, what do you mean?

123
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,571
It's most likely that the guys in black

124
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,171
made the real Rena Mizunashi undergo plastic surgery

125
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,071
to make her look just like Eisuke's older sister

126
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,871
because of something having to do with Eisuke's father.

127
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:26,671
What? What's the identity of that boy's father?

128
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:30,471
I don't know yet, but all I can say is that

129
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,271
he is most probably a member of "the Company".

130
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:35,471
Company?

131
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,471
Don't tell me that...

132
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,271
I'm just saying most probably.

133
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,471
It's not that he himself said so.

134
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,571
Hey, you.

135
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,471
Aren't you prying a bit too deeply? It can be dangerous.

136
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,671
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

137
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,571
Yeah, at least for now.

138
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,671
At least for now?

139
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,971
Oh, I want to confirm something before I go.

140
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,571
Do you know what blood type Rena Mizunashi is?

141
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:58,371
Blood type AB, RH+.

142
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:00,271
Just as I thought.

143
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,871
Okay, I'll try checking on his father, on our side too.

144
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,771
But, promise me that you won't step into the dangerous zone!

145
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,571
Okay, thanks Jodie.

146
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,671
And, how was it?

147
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,371
Were the older sister of the boy named Eisuke

148
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,971
and Rena Mizunashi really two different people?

149
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,771
Yeah, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

150
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:22,971
and Eisuke Hondo is blood type O.

151
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,671
If the story about Eisuke receiving a blood transfusion

152
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,771
from his older sister is true,

153
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,371
they're two different people.

154
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:28,371
Because blood type O people

155
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:31,071
can only receive blood from people with the same blood type!

156
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,871
But, he received the blood transfusion

157
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:34,871
when he was a child, didn't he?

158
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:38,471
It could be that he's mistaken.

159
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,971
Yeah, it's possible.

160
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,171
Including the fact of whether he really has blood type O.

161
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,271
Why don't you go confirm it by asking him directly then?

162
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,471
Or, hospitalizing him and checking it out?

163
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:50,971
Oh, come of it!

164
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:52,271
Either way, it's true that

165
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,971
we've got to check up on that as soon as possible.

166
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:58,271
We've got to find out why he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

167
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,571
and make him stop,

168
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,571
before those guys in black take note of him!

169
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:07,371
Right! Those guys were also looking for her.

170
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:10,871
Yeah, and most probably really desperately too.

171
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:14,471
Wouldn't it be a good idea to make them see each other then?

172
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,771
You know where she's hospitalized,

173
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:19,271
and besides that boy named Eisuke

174
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,671
is not a member of their group, right?

175
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:25,671
No, I can't risk letting them see each other yet.

176
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:29,171
Because there's still a possibility that Eisuke Hondo

177
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:33,371
is being used by them without his being aware!

178
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,871
"Haido Central Hospital."

179
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,571
"Aoyama General Hospital."

180
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:23,471
You've finally awakened?

181
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,271
You're...

182
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,071
You don't remember?

183
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,271
I'm the one who ran you down with my car.

184
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:32,171
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

185
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,771
I'm sorry, just because of my carelessness.

186
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:44,671
No, I was absent-minded too.

187
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,971
Don't you have a headache? Does any part of your body hurt?

188
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,171
No, I'm fine.

189
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,171
I'm glad! I'll go get the doctor now!

190
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,471
What's your name?

191
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,871
I'm Akemi Miyano.

192
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:03,771
I'm Dai Moroboshi. Nice to meet you.

193
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:07,571
Oh, yes, same here!

194
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:33,638
What? You know where Rena Mizunashi's condo is?

195
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:34,638
Are you serious?

196
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:38,238
Yep. She asked us to check on an incident for her in the past.

197
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,138
Right, dad?

198
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,738
Yeah.

199
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,738
Doorbell prank?

200
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:52,038
And you want me to nab the one who's doing it?

201
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,838
See, I told you that it'd be rude to ask him.

202
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:04,638
I checked and found out...

203
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,638
A kid!

204
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:09,538
No good. If you're a boy, be strong

205
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:12,138
and put your mother at ease.

206
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:17,238
So, it turned out to be a prank played by a kid.

207
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,238
I'm home!

208
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,738
Oh, hi, Conan.

209
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:25,038
Then, why didn't you take Eisuke along?

210
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:26,638
He can make out if it's really his older sister or not

211
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,338
if they meet, right?

212
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:31,438
Because I didn't think it was a very good idea to tell him

213
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,838
where a famous announcer lived without asking permission first.

214
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,138
And, I didn't want to build up his hope,

215
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,338
then find out she was the wrong person and disappoint him even more.

216
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,238
I'm telling you it's not her!

217
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:44,038
He watched that video of Rena Mizunashi

218
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,738
but insisted that she wasn't his older sister too, right?

219
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,538
I guess so.

220
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:51,338
It's good that he didn't go.

221
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,638
Those guys in black are likely

222
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:57,738
watching that condo now after Rena Mizunashi disappeared.

223
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:02,338
If Eisuke Hondo was taken to her place,

224
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:03,738
they would immediately lay their eyes on him,

225
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,138
and things would have taken a turn for the worse.

226
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,638
So, Rena Mizunashi wasn't the older sister,

227
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:13,438
who ran away from home of that klutzy boy?

228
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,938
Nope, well, he said she wasn't.

229
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:19,038
Come to think of it, back then.

230
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:26,138
I used to have a younger brother about his age in the past.

231
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,138
So, it wasn't the klutzy kid she was referring to then?

232
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,338
I guess not.

233
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,538
Besides, I'm sure that his blood type was not the same as Rena,

234
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:37,038
when I asked him about it some time ago.

235
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,938
Come on, Ran, just because their siblings,

236
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,338
their blood types don't have to be the same, you know.

237
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:44,138
But, in that video she said,

238
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:46,338
"I'm blood type AB!"

239
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,538
Blood type AB people

240
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,638
can only give blood to the same blood type people, right?

241
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:51,638
Yep.

242
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,238
If I remember correctly,

243
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:54,938
Eisuke mentioned that his older sister gave him blood for a transfusion

244
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:57,238
when he was a child and saved him.

245
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:00,638
I see, so if that klutz and Rena Mizunashi are really siblings,

246
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:03,338
they should both be blood type AB.

247
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:07,638
What blood type did Eisuke say he was?

248
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,438
If I remember correctly...

249
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,038
Blood type O.

250
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,038
Hey, are you all right?

251
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:21,338
Yes, I just tripped over something on the floor.

252
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,738
Oh, I see. The tile is a slightly flipped over.

253
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,538
Oh, unlucky, as usual.

254
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:30,338
No, I think you're possessed by something else.

255
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,038
When did Eisuke come?

256
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,338
Together with us a while ago.

257
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,338
He was using the restroom.

258
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:40,638
I'm the very first assistant of the Mouri Detective Agency, you see.

259
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:44,038
But, unfortunately, I have no work you can help me with.

260
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,038
Is that so?

261
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:49,738
By the way, what's all this interest in my blood type about?

262
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,638
We were wondering what blood type you are.

263
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:55,038
You see, we're interested in what blood type you are.

264
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:58,938
Come on, why don't you tell him straight that he's blood type O,

265
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,938
so he's not Rena Mizunashi's younger brother?

266
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,238
But, what if he's thinking somewhere in his heart

267
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:05,538
that she may be his older sister?

268
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,638
I feel so sorry for him.

269
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:10,838
-Hey, are you really blood type O? -Yes.

270
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:13,738
Have you donated blood recently?

271
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,838
Oh, no, I haven't.

272
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,438
Then, have you been brought to the hospital

273
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,538
because of a bad injury or something?

274
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,538
No, I haven't.

275
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,838
I used to go to the hospital a lot when I was little

276
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,938
because of wounds and illness.

277
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:29,238
I remember it was back when I just entered grade school.

278
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,938
Bye bye.

279
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,638
I was run over by a car.

280
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,138
But, I haven't been hospitalized since.

281
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:39,938
You mean when you received blood transfusion from your older sister?

282
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,138
Yes. Well, I do slip and fall,

283
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,738
and get little cuts and bruises every day even now, though.

284
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,538
I'll bet.

285
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,138
Oh, right.

286
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,838
If you're that interested in knowing what blood type I am,

287
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,238
why don't you come with me tomorrow to where I'm going?

288
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:56,238
I'm sure you'll get your answer.

289
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,238
I was contacted by a person of the mansion

290
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,038
that my mother and I used to stay at before,

291
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:02,338
telling me that my mother's belongings were found.

292
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,738
So, I'm going to go pick them up.

293
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:06,738
Belongings? Your mother passed away?

294
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,538
Yes, from an illness.

295
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:12,438
It seems that my mother-child booklet is in there too.

296
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,738
What shall we do?

297
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:17,138
I don't think so, because I've got something to do tomorrow.

298
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:21,638
Oh, but, it's the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho 3-chome,

299
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,138
very near from here.

300
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,538
Huh? If it's to the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho,

301
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:28,038
I'm going there tomorrow too.

302
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,238
Dad.

303
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,838
Is it for work?

304
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:35,238
Yeah. Something about the oldest son of the family

305
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,538
was killed in a queer way, a year ago.

306
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,138
And they have no clue as to who the killer is.

307
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:43,838
They contacted me, the famed, Kogoro Mouri

308
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:46,738
to re-investigate the case.

309
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,538
Oh, their son, you mean Tango?

310
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,538
Oh, I'm sure that was the name.

311
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:54,538
Oh, so you know him, Eisuke?

312
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:57,338
Rather, it was when I was a child,

313
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:59,738
so the only thing I remember is his name.

314
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:01,438
But, how cruel.

315
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,238
You just said you didn't have any cases.

316
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,138
I meant, I don't have any cases

317
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,138
that a klutz like you can help me with.

318
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,538
Oh, come on.

319
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:18,438
Your mother was working here as a housekeeper?

320
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,938
Yes, we lived here. She raised me while working here.

321
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:32,038
Back then, what were your father and older sister doing?

322
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,838
I was told that my dad was working in Osaka

323
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:38,438
and that my sister was studying abroad as an exchange student.

324
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,838
But, she used to come home, every vacation she had.

325
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:44,738
As for dad, the most I got to see of him was during New Years.

326
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,838
"The morgue."

327
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,438
After my mother passed away,

328
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,738
my father took custody of me,

329
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,538
and I ended up living in Osaka with him for a while.

330
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,238
For a while? You mean you don't live with him now?

331
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:02,338
No, it seems that father went abroad on a business trip.

332
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,638
And since then, I was taken care of at an acquaintance's house.

333
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,138
What an irresponsible father.

334
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:10,538
I wouldn't be surprised that your older sister left home.

335
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,938
But, my father sends me money every month.

336
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:21,838
"Eiko Okudaira (56)" -My Eisuke, long time no see.

337
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:24,138
Has it been about ten years since I last saw you?

338
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:26,238
You've really grown!

339
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,838
Yes, thanks to everyone.

340
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,438
I've taken your mother's belongings out.

341
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:33,238
Come on in, everyone.

342
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,738
Oh, Kikuyo, will you please show them in?

343
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,538
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:43,838
She's the housekeeper that came to work for us after your mother.

345
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,338
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -She's not all that amiable,

346
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:48,138
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -but she's a very kind person.

347
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:49,638
Well...

348
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,338
My, are you also here accompanying Eisuke?

349
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:53,438
Oh, no,

350
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:58,138
I'm Kogoro Mouri and have come by request of your husband.

351
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,638
My, you mean that famous detective.

352
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,238
I've heard about you from my husband.

353
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:04,938
Yes!

354
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:09,238
I'll show Detective Mouri to my husband's study,

355
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:12,438
so you go ahead and show Eisuke and the others to the living room.

356
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:14,538
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:27,338
Oh, they sure look alike.

358
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:29,938
Eisuke really looks like his mother, doesn't he?

359
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:34,638
I guess so because he didn't look like his father.

360
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,738
Oh, here it is.

361
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,538
The mother-child booklet!

362
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,738
It's written over here, see?

363
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:46,838
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

364
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,738
True.

365
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:51,038
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

366
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:52,338
I see.

367
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,938
So, all that's left now is to verify the story

368
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,938
about whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

369
00:19:56,938 --> 00:20:00,438
I'm sorry, that the bag is slightly squashed.

370
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,538
I wonder why that bag was where it was.

371
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:06,138
It was stuck way in back of the drawer in my dresser.

372
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,438
But, I'm glad it was found.

373
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,338
We showed it to Mrs. Okudaira

374
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,638
and found out it was the belongings of the housekeeper

375
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,438
who worked here before,

376
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:16,338
that's why we called you.

377
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:21,238
Moreover, today is the first anniversary of Tango's death.

378
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:22,538
First anniversary of death?

379
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:23,938
Mrs. Okudaira remarked that

380
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:27,538
she thought that her son had summoned everyone here.

381
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,038
Long time no see.

382
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:30,338
Although it's been ten years since I last saw you,

383
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:32,438
you haven't changed much, Mr. Segawa.

384
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,038
No, the one who was working here when you were here

385
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,838
was my older brother.

386
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:42,138
He also passed away two years ago today of a traffic accident.

387
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,138
Then this is the story.

388
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:50,338
Mr. Okudaira, while you were showing the home video

389
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:53,538
that you filmed to everyone except your son,

390
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:55,538
who was drowned in the pool

391
00:20:55,538 --> 00:21:00,438
by someone who had snuck in from outside.

392
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:04,538
Yeah, the police said that the estimated time of death of my son,

393
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,438
was between 9:00 to 10:00 pm.

394
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:09,238
We were all in the living room for 5 hours from 7:00 to 12:00

395
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:12,838
watching the video right through.

396
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:27,838
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

397
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:30,738
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

398
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:32,838
Talk about terrible.

399
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,638
But, why the video?

400
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,438
Well, the housekeeper

401
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:40,238
was screaming at the top of her lungs the following morning

402
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,638
about my son being in the pool with all the water drained.

403
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:44,738
I thought that she was playing a joke on us,

404
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,538
trying to surprise us.

405
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,438
But, it was no joke

406
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:52,738
and it turned out that he was really dead.

407
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:54,638
Do you have any idea of anyone

408
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:57,038
who could've had a grudge against your son?

409
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,238
An idea of anyone,

410
00:21:59,238 --> 00:22:01,938
not outside, but rather inside this house.

411
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:04,138
Just what do you mean?

412
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:07,738
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

413
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:11,038
My son was killed by someone sly and clever

414
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,638
who lives in this house.

415
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:53,538
A year ago,

416
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:57,038
the oldest son of the Okudaira family was murdered.

417
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,438
The murder has still not yet been found.

418
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,038
But the master of the house insists that

419
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:03,738
the murderer is someone in the house.

420
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:06,538
Is it really so?

421
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,438
Before even getting to reveal the truth,

422
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:12,838
the head of the household himself dies along with a shriek.

423
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,338
Next on Detective Conan,

424
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:20,738
"Red and Black Crash: A Shriek."

425
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,238
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:40,638
Valuable vase.

427
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:41,938
Eisuke, don't go near it!

428
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,938
Don't worry, I'm just going to take a look.

429
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,938
He's been punished.
