1
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:13,194
What? You're Kaneyama's punk friend?

2
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:14,994
"Onda Kazuyoshi (48)" -Did he tell you to make me come...

3
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:17,394
"Game Software Company President" -to a place like this?

4
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:18,694
"Oomine Ryosuke (24)" -Shut up!

5
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:21,194
Cut out your blabbering and give me all the money you got!

6
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:26,194
I'm paying Kanayama salary like I should.

7
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,094
But that's only chicken feed.

8
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,394
You should paid the equal amount of money

9
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,794
that is right for the work.

10
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,894
What you guys are doing is none other than mugging people.

11
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:37,494
I'm reporting you to the police!

12
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:43,894
What's wrong?

13
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,094
You're a 4th dan in Judo

14
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:48,994
and was even a candidate for the Olympics, weren't you?

15
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:51,194
Try sticking me out to the police!

16
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:54,794
You made a lot of dough

17
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:57,594
from the game software made by Kanayama, didn't you?

18
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:01,494
You can't even handle a computer yourself, and yet...

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,194
you go ahead and make a profit of 20 billion yen.

20
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,994
What does Kanayama get, just a mere 100,000 yen?

21
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,894
Talk about ridiculous!

22
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:10,194
No, you see the company

23
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:13,794
also invested quite a lot to the development of the game.

24
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:16,794
Shut up! Miser!

25
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,694
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,994
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,694
A kidnapper that's a bit dense.

28
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:03,894
Held as hostage, what goes with my fate?

29
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:05,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,294
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,294
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:56,348
"Two Days with the Culprit (1st Day)"

33
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:01,748
"Mix Mall."

34
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:05,848
"Cream Heaven."

35
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,432
We're lucky to have you around!

36
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,687
Yes, really. Thanks to you, Conan.

37
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:14,187
We get to eat the Dragon Mountain Parfait of Creamy Heaven...

38
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,587
"Kid's Service for those..." -with a 20 percent discount.

39
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:18,487
"who bring along an elementary student" -We're sure lucky.

40
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,987
I'm unlucky

41
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:25,087
because I wanted to watch the soccer game on TV.

42
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,187
The toy department is over there!

43
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,287
Don't go too far!

44
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,487
Just come back before we finish eating!

45
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,687
Yes, that's right.

46
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,487
There's probably no doubt that it's Oomine.

47
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:54,287
It seems that he's taken a child hostage.

48
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,087
Please save Kayoko.

49
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,587
Please.

50
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,487
We give you our word that we'll save her.

51
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:04,687
The girl that's been taken hostage is 5 years old Kayoko Yuuki.

52
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:07,387
Yes, we'll be careful.

53
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,887
Because it seems as if he's armed with a gun.

54
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,087
Please come along with us, Mrs. Yuuki.

55
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,687
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,587
A child's been taken hostage.

57
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,387
The kidnapper's armed with a gun.

58
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:35,587
If the kidnapper tries to escape from the shopping mall...

59
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:45,287
he could only do so by car.

60
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:53,587
Ran, that brat would never get lost.

61
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,187
True.

62
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,887
Inspector Megure?

63
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,787
This is Mrs. Natsumi Yuuki, the mother of Kayoko

64
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,187
that is being held hostage.

65
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,287
If he were to get hold of a car,

66
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:07,687
it would be a place where people wouldn't see him.

67
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,487
Like behind a pillar,

68
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:13,287
and some place far away from the entrance.

69
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:33,287
It's Kayoko that's being held hostage.

70
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:40,787
I'm borrowing your car!

71
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,787
What are you doing?

72
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:54,187
Here we go!

73
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:57,687
Stay still.

74
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:05,787
Kayoko!

75
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,187
There he is!

76
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,187
Oomine is in the parking lot!

77
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,487
Come, hurry!

78
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,587
You brat!

79
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:16,787
Conan?

80
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:19,487
Darn.

81
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,587
Okay... you're fine now!

82
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:26,287
Oomine! Throw your gun down and turn yourself in!

83
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,787
You can't get away!

84
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:31,487
Don't dare move, you brat!

85
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,087
First I've got to check if he's armed with a gun,

86
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,387
or it's too dangerous for me to do anything.

87
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,287
Oomine's in the parking lot!

88
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,087
All of you block the entrance and exit!

89
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,787
I wonder what it is?

90
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,087
Talk about junk driver!

91
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,787
Halt! Police!

92
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:21,787
Out of the way! Stupid!

93
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,787
It's dangerous, please get out of the way!

94
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,487
Conan?

95
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,787
The life of the hostage is top priority!

96
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,687
-Copy? -Yes, sir!

97
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:47,987
Dad! Conan's in big trouble!

98
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:53,987
Junk driver!

99
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:57,487
You're a hostage, so stop acting so haughty, brat!

100
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:58,587
Up ahead!

101
00:08:58,587 --> 00:08:59,887
What?

102
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,587
And, the next news is...

103
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,287
That's...

104
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,987
Is it Oomine?

105
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:20,587
How dare he...

106
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:22,387
Inspector Megure!

107
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,687
Chiba?

108
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,987
We've safely rescued Kayoko.

109
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:30,387
However, please stay calm.

110
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,587
Conan's being...

111
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,487
Conan's being held hostage!

112
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,387
I found out quite a while ago!

113
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,587
You guys hurry up and come over here and join us!

114
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,287
It looks like he got away, did he?

115
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,987
Yes, looks like he did.

116
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,287
Last night, the president of a company,

117
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,687
Mr. Kazuyoshi was found murdered in a park in Shibuya ward.

118
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,087
The prime suspect is.

119
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,587
Ryosuke Oomine, 25 years old.

120
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:58,987
-Idiot! -He is now on the wanted list.

121
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,087
-I'm still 24! -Oomine seems to have

122
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,987
taken a boy hostage at the shopping mall in Haido cho,

123
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,287
and is now on the run.

124
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,387
There's strong possibility that

125
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:11,387
he is armed with a gun...

126
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:14,287
Are you a murderer, mister?

127
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,987
Yeah, did it bugs you?

128
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:22,387
Of course it bugs me. Give me a break.

129
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:24,287
Did you said Conan's been kidnapped?

130
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:27,987
I'm sorry, despite me being with him...

131
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,487
Which way did his car go?

132
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,687
I'd advise you not to get involved this time.

133
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,387
Inspector.

134
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,887
Oomine who kidnapped Conan

135
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,087
is a punk who loiters around the Shinjuku area.

136
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,187
He has a record and has been arrested twice

137
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,487
on charges of mugging, battery and assault.

138
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,087
Mr. Onda who was murdered

139
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:49,687
is the president of a major game software company,

140
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:53,287
a successful man who has an annual income of a several million yen.

141
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,687
But, he was plagued with money trouble

142
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,787
because he paid his employees extremely low salaries

143
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:01,187
and failed to pay his suppliers as well.

144
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:04,887
Oomine had heard of President Onda's

145
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:08,287
dictator-like actions from his colleague, Mr. Kanayama

146
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:11,787
who was working at the company.

147
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:15,087
It seems that Oomine was angered at Onda's ways

148
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,487
and tried to take money from him,

149
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:20,087
but inadvertently shot him.

150
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,887
All of what happened

151
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:25,387
was found in the surveillance camera set up in the park.

152
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:31,587
It is very likely that Oomine is still armed with a gun.

153
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:34,087
Leave everything to us this time.

154
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:37,087
We've already set up cordon too.

155
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,887
Conan.

156
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:00,052
We're staying here for a while.

157
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,252
Let me go home already.

158
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:04,452
You don't need me anymore.

159
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,069
If I let you go,

160
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:08,969
you're going to tell the officers about me, right?

161
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:09,969
No, I won't.

162
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:12,269
I know you'll tell them!

163
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,469
Do I look like I'll do something like that?

164
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,169
Yep.

165
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:21,869
I'll have to check

166
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:24,669
whether he has a gun on him or not.

167
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,469
After that, I either grasp the chance to knock him down or flee.

168
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,569
He abandoned the car here?

169
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,969
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,869
He's either hiding somewhere around here

171
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:44,569
or used this place as a relay station and fled.

172
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,869
-Search the vicinity thoroughly! -Yes, sir.

175
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:55,369
Dad?

176
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,769
In the papers about 2 months ago, I'm sure that

177
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,069
there was an article special on Mr. Onda's company.

178
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,069
Here!

179
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,269
What do you want to search for?

180
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,469
About a man called Kanayama,

181
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:15,369
an employee working under President Onda, as well as Oomine's friend.

"Seiichi Kanayama."

00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,269
This sure is convenient!

185
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:29,669
We changed our line to wireless (Musen ran) too last month.

"Youngest programmer." -He developed this many game software?

190
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,669
This guy sure is a genius game developer.

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,369

193
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:55,969
Of course.

00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,669
I won't connect.

197
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,769
Okay, I guess I'll do it.

198
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,769
I'm scared!

199
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,169
Wait!

200
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,869
-What? -A mouse!

201
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:19,069
There's no mouse here.

202
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,069
He doesn't have a gun.

203
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,069
Cut it out, you...

204
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,969
If he doesn't have a gun...

205
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,469
Come.

206
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,869
It should be this room.

207
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,269
Why do you have so many keys on you?

208
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,669
Stop asking questions at a time like this.

209
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,369
What's that sound?

210
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:19,869
Hurry up and get inside.

211
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,869
Bingo. I can get outside from there.

212
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:31,669
Back then...

213
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,269
Do you know the person that fired the gun?

214
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,669
Of course not.

215
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,169
Then, who was it?

216
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:51,669
How did he know you were there?

217
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,669
And besides, why did he fire the gun?

218
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:55,769
How should I know?

219
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,769
Hurry up and come.

220
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,169
It seems that the guy gave up.

221
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,769
He gave up quite easily.

222
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,169
Besides, what was that explosive sound?

223
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,569
Why didn't you say anything?

224
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,469
The guy that just passed by is a police officer, right?

225
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,269
Since you're a hostage,

226
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,569
if you see an officer, you'd try to ask for help, right?

227
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:38,569
Really?

228
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,469
That's only natural, right?

229
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:43,769
But why did you risk getting shot to protect me?

230
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,069
You could've fled alone.

231
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:48,969
That's true.

232
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,969
That's only natural, right?

233
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,169
I guess.

234
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:55,069
Are you really a murderer?

235
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,769
I'm the one who shot him, so there's no doubt about it!

236
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,469
You don't look like that kind of a character, though.

237
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:05,069
Will you lend me your cell phone?

238
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,569
-Why? -Quick!

Doc.

00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:42,269
You're Mr. Seiichi Kanayama, aren't you?

242
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,069
"Seiichi Kanayama (24)" -Famed detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

243
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,769
It took you more time then I expected.

244
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,169
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

245
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:53,569
Did you go shopping?

246
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,569
I went to the convenience store.

247
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:01,569
Well, rather than standing here and talking,

248
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:04,069
please come over to my room.

249
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:08,269
You've got a lot of things you want to ask me, don't you?

250
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:11,269
Yes. I guess so.

251
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,469
"Unit 202, Seiichi Kanayama."

252
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,669
The child that Oomine took hostage

253
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,169
is the boy staying at your place, isn't he?

254
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,269
Oomine hasn't been arrested yet

255
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,969
and I guess as the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

256
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:28,069
you'd like to find Oomine yourself, wouldn't you?

257
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:33,269
If so, he would first come to my place.

258
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,169
That's the only natural way to think, right?

259
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,569
You seem to be Oomine's colleague.

260
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:43,869
He was my classmate during my intermediate school days in Morioka.

261
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:47,369
And, I used to meet him now and then, even after coming to Tokyo.

262
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,569
Oomine tried to take money from Mr. Onda for you

263
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,969
and ended up doing what he did.

264
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,169
As to that, I do feel bad.

265
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,669
Because I did bad mouth the president.

266
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,469
I said that he only paid cheap salary despite making a big profit.

267
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,769
Just because he was strong at judo, he was tyrannical

268
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,269
and resorted to violence for almost everything.

269
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,569
The president was really sly.

270
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,869
He used to take millions of yen.

271
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:15,969
I developed the game software

272
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:19,869
and yet my annual salary was only 3 million yen!

273
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,169
Excuse me.

274
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,969
"Missed call from Oomine" -I haven't been answering.

275
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,969
That mark looks familiar, doesn't it?

276
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,669
Well, he calls. Just answer.

277
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:38,969
What's this?

278
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,769
You mean the police didn't come to the apartment?

279
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,869
Don't be silly.

280
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,869
Aren't you the one who tempted Oomine

281
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,169
to commit the crime, Momoko?

282
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:50,669
"Momoko Uemiya (24)" -Why would I, the president's secretary

283
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,369
do something like that?

284
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,969
You used to call him "daddy"

285
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,869
and sucked a lot of cash out of him, didn't you?

286
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:01,269
You mean you're sulky because I brushed you off?

287
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,569
Well, who cares.

288
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,369
Why don't you work rather

289
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,869
doing chat from the company.

290
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:08,669
That's none of your business!

291
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,769
I think you should suspect Momoko.

292
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,369
She's Mr. Onda's secretary.

293
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,369
Is there anyone else?

294
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,569
Well...

295
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,569
"OnDack Co."

296
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:24,969
"Satoshi Kanda" -The vice president, Mr. Kanda.

297
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:29,069
"Satoshi Kanda (32)" -Because he was being bullied by the president.

298
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:33,369
Bullied? In other words, power harassment?

299
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:37,169
If I were him, I would've quit the company long ago.

300
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,369
Well, if there were to be an accomplice,

301
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,969
I think this is about it.

302
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:46,569
There's another major figure left, isn't there?

303
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,469
You, Mr. Kanayama.

304
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,769
Hey, watch your step.

305
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,469
Did you hear something just now?

306
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:09,469
Over that way.

307
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,469
You go around from that side.

308
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:12,769
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,769
I can't afford to make him get caught just yet.

310
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,569
Hurry and hide.

311
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,369
Quick.

312
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:53,469
That was dangerous!

313
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,969
Is that you, Dr. Agasa?

314
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,069
What brings you here?

315
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,269
Oh, well, you see...

316
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,469
An emergency. I'm very much in a rush.

317
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,469
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,869
So, I've got to go. Bye.

319
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,369
No need to worry anymore.

320
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,169
Thank you, Doc.

321
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:24,069
You're a life saver.

322
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:29,369
Right, nothing will be solved if he gets caught now.

323
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:33,469
I have a feeling there's something more behind this case.

324
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,469
"Next Episode" -Ran! Are you've been taken hostage too!

325
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,969
-Dad! -Renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

326
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:09,869
has captured the murderer Ryosuke Oomine!

327
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:14,169
Mr. Oomine may have been used by someone.

328
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,069
There's blood on.

329
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,569
