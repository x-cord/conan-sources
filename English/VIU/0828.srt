1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,457
We all end up going to the ramen shop

2
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:04,457
that MA frequents after school

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:09,357
since seeing the special program on ramen the day before.

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,057
There, we run into Ms. Yuna Shono,

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,057
Mr. Sosuke Mizushina

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,557
and Mr. Osamu Nakanishi.

7
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:21,457
They were all a bit odd in that they each used

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,458
a lot of seasoning such as vinegar, soy sauce and pepper.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,557
As the three leave the shop, in turn,

10
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:32,057
lady cop Yumi Miyamoto and Naeko Miike come bursting into the shop.

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,457
According to them, the threesome were suspects of a murder case

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,158
that occurred in the neighborhood.

13
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:42,358
A week ago when we were patrolling this area...

14
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:45,757
Hey, you over there!

15
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,358
What're you doing?

16
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:49,858
Hold it!

17
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:54,257
So, I quickly went around with the car and waited.

18
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,358
But only Yumi showed up.

19
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,557
It seems that they had a get together of all the shops that day

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,257
that almost all the lights of the shops were out, with no passersby.

21
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:06,457
And the only place open was

22
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,757
this "Ogura Ramen Good Enough to Die For"!

23
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:18,257
Then, isn't the last person who came rushing in here the perp?

24
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:19,457
The thing is

25
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,457
the three came at about the same time like they did today.

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,957
From the time the three came, till the two lady cops came,

27
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,657
quite some time had gone by.

28
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:31,957
What? Didn't you run after the perp, Yumi?

29
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,758
Well, Yumi seems to have fell while she was chasing the perp.

30
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,557
I fell because of the hose!

31
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,857
Hose?

32
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:45,957
The perp threw it at me while I was chasing him!

33
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,857
We thought it was the murder weapon at first.

34
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,157
What made you think it was the murder weapon?

35
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:55,257
The lady was bleeding from her head and died, right?

36
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:56,957
When we first saw the perp,

37
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,957
he was spinning the hose around

38
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,857
in front of the front door of the victim's house with all his might!

39
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,057
Spinning the hose...

40
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,857
With all his might?

41
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,357
Talk about remembering...

42
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,957
On the day and time of the incident that day,

43
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,757
there was another person.

44
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,057
Another customer...

45
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:19,458
Was here?

46
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:25,957
A canvas stained black with crime.

47
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,557
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

48
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:30,457
Another dangerous customer?

49
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,657
Find the perp that is spinning the hose.

50
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,257
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:36,257
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,758
His name is Detective Conan!

53
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,410
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 2)"

54
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,009
Wait!

55
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,709
That day, when we came running into this shop,

56
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,909
only the three that was here awhile ago was here, right?

57
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,309
That's right.

58
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,109
Because that customer finished up his ramen

59
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,809
a minute before the three came in and left.

60
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,709
Yumi's boyfriend!

61
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,809
The ramen here is the best after all!

62
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,310
-What? Haneda Meijin? -What? Haneda Meijin?

63
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,009
But that can't be!

64
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,809
Because like I just said.

65
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,009
Back then, Yumi and I flanked the perp that fled

66
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,509
along the street in front of this shop!

67
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,909
We cornered him into this shop!

68
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,409
If her boyfriend went out just before the perp came into this shop,

69
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,209
either Yumi or I would've seen him!

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,710
Right?

71
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,009
The thing is...

72
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,710
What? Back then, you ran into him on this street?

73
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,109
It was while you were chasing the perp, right?

74
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,209
Yes, I guess.

75
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,209
When I tripped after the perp threw the hose at me,

76
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,110
he came running over to me.

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,609
Are you okay?

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,909
Chukichi?

79
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,409
Yumi?

80
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,009
What're you doing here?

81
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,309
What about you, Yumi?

82
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,909
I'm chasing after a suspicious guy!

83
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,109
Didn't you pass him?

84
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,909
Yes, a while ago. But it was dark,

85
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,309
so all I heard were footsteps and saw a silhouette.

86
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,709
A silhouette, huh?

87
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,110
And he threw something like masking tape and left.

88
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,909
Masking tape?

89
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,409
Either way, it's dangerous here, so go home, Chukichi!

90
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,610
I'll give you the details later!

91
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,309
I haven't contacted him since.

92
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,710
Because the case isn't closed yet.

93
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,209
I see. I was wondering why you took so long,

94
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,409
when all you did was trip.

95
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,909
You should've told me.

96
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,809
I'm sorry. Back then, he wasn't out of breath at all

97
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,109
so I knew he wasn't the perp.

98
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,009
And I didn't want to get him involved.

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,809
But no matter if he wasn't out of breath...

100
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,509
-What? -Yeah, I guess so.

101
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,809
Letting him go without doing anything isn't police like.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,409
But...

103
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,009
If he was eating ramen here up

104
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,909
until just before the incident happened,

105
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,409
Chukichi is completely innocent!

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,309
Right.

107
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,609
Come to think of it, your boyfriend's name is Chukichi?

108
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,409
He's my ex-boyfriend, though.

109
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,109
Then, why don't you try calling him?

110
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,809
He's got good memory, right? Your boyfriend.

111
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,209
My ex-boyfriend.

112
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,909
Okay then.

113
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,409
I guess I'll try calling my big brother too, then.

114
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,309
After all, he's the one who told me about this shop.

115
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,009
So, he may have seen the three.

116
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,010
Yeah.

117
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,309
Maybe we'll figure out who the perp is

118
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,109
just by asking on the phone.

119
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,110
No way.

120
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,609
Hello, Yumi.

121
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,109
I'm sorry about last time that I turned you down for a date.

122
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,909
I don't know why but I happen to come up

123
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,709
with urgent business on your day off.

124
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,109
Never mind that.

125
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,409
But, do you remember?

126
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,609
A week ago when I was chasing a suspicious person and tripped partway,

127
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,209
the time I ran into you.

128
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,710
Sorry, it's call waiting. Hang on.

129
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,809
-Big brother. -Gosh.

130
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,109
What? You're talking to someone important now so call you back?

131
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Hey, wait!

132
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,909
What? Are you done with your call?

133
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,409
Who was it?

134
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,709
-Don't tell me you found a new girl? -No!

135
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,309
Darn it. He hung up on me.

136
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,009
Their conversation's weirdly synchronized.

137
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,309
Well, whatever.

138
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,309
And about the guy you passed...

139
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,609
Is there anything you haven't told me?

140
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,709
Anything I haven't told you?

141
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,009
Come to think of it,

142
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,509
he made a strange sound each time he ran.

143
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,209
Like click-click.

144
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,210
What? He made a strange sound "click click" each time he ran?

145
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,809
Not click-click, but click click?

146
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,009
Not click-click, but click click...

147
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,809
Each time he ran?

148
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,509
I see.

149
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,509
In order to pick that up, the perp...

150
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,509
When you checked inside the shop,

151
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,509
did you check inside the restroom, too?

152
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,209
Of course, we did.

153
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,009
Inside the water tank, too?

154
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,509
We took a quick look,

155
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,210
but there was no accessory or anything like that.

156
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,410
What?

157
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,210
-Masumi? -Conan?

158
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,210
Hey.

159
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,409
I see.

160
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,609
That's why the perp was spinning the hose around.

161
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,809
In order not to leave this back at the scene,

162
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,610
and the fact that the perp is still continuing to come to this shop means...

163
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,509
He hasn't retrieved it yet.

164
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,110
The treasure worth several million yen.

165
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,992
"The following day"

166
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:58,491
-Hello, welcome! -Hello!

167
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,191
Thank you for your patronage!

168
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:02,292
There are no other customers today.

169
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,791
Until just a while ago, there was a group of people here, though.

170
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,592
Really?

171
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,491
Hello!

172
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,191
I've come again today, boss!

173
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:24,491
Hey. You're here with the kid today, Mari?

174
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,591
My name's Masumi.

175
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,691
Boss, may I order?

176
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,692
Yeah!

177
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:35,791
I want pot sticks, shumai, spring rolls and small rice.

178
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,691
Oh, come on! No ramen again today?

179
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,691
Have you gotten tired of it?

180
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:43,891
No, it's not that.

181
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:47,491
All you ever ate was the Great King Yama ramen and yet.

182
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:49,491
Really?

183
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:54,091
But then, why'd you sit in that seat?

184
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:55,391
Huh?

185
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:58,991
See, there's only a little bit of shoyu.

186
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,091
It'll run out right away, won't it?

187
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:05,491
Because with pot sticks, shumai and spring rolls...

188
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,491
You need shoyu, right?

189
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,891
You were using a lot of shoyu yesterday, too.

190
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,391
And since you ran out of shoyu,

191
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:13,791
you used another bottle of shoyu.

192
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,691
Well...

193
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,891
Besides, before we came here,

194
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,691
there were no other customers, right?

195
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,491
And yet, why did you sit where there was

196
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:25,391
only a little shoyu left in the bottle?

197
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,691
Why?

198
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,891
Well...

199
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:34,391
No matter if you ordered a lot of dishes that use shoyu,

200
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,591
nobody would check out the amount of shoyu

201
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,791
left in the bottle before sitting down.

202
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:42,491
He probably just happened to sit there.

203
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,891
Yeah.

204
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:46,191
It's not like popsicle where you'd find a prize

205
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:51,191
at the bottom of the bottle after it's empty.

206
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:52,592
Right?

207
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:59,891
Boss! I'd like a large serving of King Yama ramen

208
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:01,391
and pot sticks with fried rice.

209
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:03,091
Hey, Sato...

210
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:06,391
Satoko, you'll get fat eating so much.

211
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,092
I'll be fine, Taka... o!

212
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,992
Because I'm planning to have quite a work-out tonight.

213
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,891
Come to think of it, do you know?

214
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:26,791
About the murder that happened around here a week ago!

215
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,391
What? No, I don't.

216
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:33,491
Something about a lady forgot something and went back home to get it,

217
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,391
when she came face to face with a burglar?

218
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:37,991
She was knocked down by the burglar who fled,

219
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:42,591
hit her head strongly on the stairs by the front entrance and died.

220
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:46,091
But instead of fleeing the scene right away,

221
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:51,391
that burglar kept spinning a hose of about 2 meters around.

222
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,491
Don't you think that's creepy?

223
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:55,491
Seriously? This is terrible!

224
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,492
I'm scared!

225
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:02,991
Wasn't that hose that he was spinning around

226
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,691
have something stuck to the tip of it?

227
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:08,791
Yeah. According to the police,

228
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,691
there seem to have been traces of masking tape

229
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,191
being stuck on to the tip of one side of the hose,

230
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,491
so something could've gotten stuck to it.

231
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:18,691
If so, what?

232
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,891
If the thing that was stuck to the tip of the hose was a breathable fabric

233
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:26,791
and if the tip with the fabric on it was swung above the head,

234
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,291
it'll work like a vacuum cleaner!

235
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:34,691
The centrifugal force forces the air inside the hose out,

236
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,591
and an amount equaled to the air forced out,

237
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:39,891
is sucked in through the other end.

238
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:42,791
They did a similar experiment on TV the other day,

239
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,291
so maybe the perp saw it, too?

240
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,291
Really?

241
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,991
But, what kind of fabric is breathable?

242
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,291
Beats me.

243
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:54,291
It seems that the hose of that house was used,

244
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,391
so it may have been something that was there,

245
00:13:56,392 --> 00:14:00,291
or maybe something that the perp had on hand.

246
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:05,291
The cloth of a handkerchief would be too fine to serve as a filter.

247
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,191
What could it be?

248
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:11,091
Something that lets air through but doesn't have large holes?

249
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:14,591
Maybe a mask?

250
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,291
Because you can breathe when wearing it,

251
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,991
but it doesn't let dust through, right?

252
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,791
Yeah!

253
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,591
Right! And talking of masks...

254
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:29,591
On the day of the incident, you had one too, right, sir? A mask.

255
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:32,292
That day, I sort of had a cold, so...

256
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:37,391
But I wonder what it was that the perp had to suck up

257
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:40,091
with a vacuum even before thinking of fleeing.

258
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:44,391
That's right. The lady cop that told me about this said

259
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:47,491
there was a person who passed that burglar,

260
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,591
and at that time, he heard a strange sound.

261
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,591
-Sound? -Yeah.

262
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,991
It seems that the burglar was making a click-click sound

263
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:57,291
with ever step he took.

264
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,691
Click click...

265
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:03,692
Maybe something was stuck to one of his shoes?

266
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:07,791
Right. Maybe he stepped on something that was hard

267
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,191
and poked into the sole of his shoe.

268
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,491
But what? What did he step on?

269
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:16,491
It's something more important than fleeing, right?

270
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:20,391
Maybe it was glasses.

271
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:23,491
If you step on it, the lens will crack, right?

272
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:24,991
I'm sure that's it!

273
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,791
Maybe the perp dropped and stepped on his glasses

274
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,491
when he got into a struggle with the woman.

275
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,191
That's why even before he fled,

276
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,291
he tried to retrieve the cracked pieces of his glasses lens

277
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,391
with the hose vacuum cleaner.

278
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,091
Because even a small piece

279
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,191
can give away what kind of lens it was,

280
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:44,191
what degree the lens was, and who bought the lens!

281
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:47,291
The police are really something!

282
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,391
Bo...

283
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:54,191
Boss! I was wearing my glasses that day, weren't I?

284
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:57,291
Huh? Yeah, you were.

285
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:03,491
But back then, you had your glasses case with you, right?

286
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:06,791
Is anything wrong with that?

287
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,291
Conan, do you have a glasses case?

288
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,691
No, I don't!

289
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,491
I have my glasses on all the time, so I don't need a case.

290
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:15,891
People who carry cases are people who use

291
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,991
both far-sighted and near-sighted glasses.

292
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:22,592
Or somebody who just bought new glasses.

293
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,791
Sometimes, the lens of new glasses are too strong

294
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,091
and can make you dizzy.

295
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,291
So I hear that they are people who carry around their old glasses

296
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,691
until they get used to the new glasses.

297
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,691
Oh, yeah. And what about those new glasses?

298
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,491
What? Oh, my new glasses?

299
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:41,791
Hey, you were wearing them, weren't you?

300
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,291
On the day that the lady who was killed was pestering you?

301
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,991
Oh, yeah?

302
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:49,391
But how strange.

303
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:53,791
The police even checked the drainage of the restroom

304
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,691
but couldn't find the cracked lens, I wonder why?

305
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,191
What? Is that so?

306
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:03,391
There were three suspects and all of them were body checked,

307
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:06,391
but nobody had it on them.

308
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:11,091
But I'm sure they'll find it if we tell the police about this!

309
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:15,291
Because the Japanese police are really efficient!

310
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,492
I'm sure, Satoko!

311
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:20,591
Oh, no! Oh, no!

312
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,092
I've got to retrieve it before the police get to it.

313
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,792
What? It's gone! It's not here!

314
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,492
I'm inside!

315
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,992
I'm still inside!

316
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:45,691
Is this the cracked piece of lens that you're looking for?

317
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,091
I hate to disappoint you,

318
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:50,791
but we found it already a half a day ago.

319
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,491
You probably thought of flushing it down the toilet, too.

320
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:57,191
But if the police check the drainage, that's it.

321
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:01,591
That's why you sunk it down the water tank

322
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:03,991
together with the parts of your glasses.

323
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,891
With lens in the water,

324
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:08,391
you've got to look really closely to see it.

325
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:10,891
And if those new glasses are frameless,

326
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,591
all you have to sink down the tank

327
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,991
are the temples and the bridge for the nose.

328
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:19,991
So, it's highly likely that they would be overlooked

329
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,491
for the parts of the water tank.

330
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:26,491
At first glance, it doesn't look like the stolen accessory either!

331
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,291
Well, it seems that you retrieved the temples

332
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:32,391
and bridge of your glasses the following day.

333
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,891
But we found out after checking the lens that

334
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:39,292
it was for the glasses you purchased last month at an eyeglasses shop!

335
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:43,391
So, what?

336
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:46,691
That's no proof that I killed that lady, is it?

337
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,391
We also found the pierce earrings

338
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:52,191
that you hid in the shoyu bottle long ago.

339
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,591
Huh?

340
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,791
You probably hid it impulsively

341
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,791
just before Yumi and the other lady cop came in here

342
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,291
but you couldn't figure out which shoyu bottle it was,

343
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,091
so you kept coming here every day since, right?

344
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,791
That's why you kept ordering Tenshin dishes

345
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,791
that you'd be using shoyu with, correct?

346
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:14,291
The fingerprints on the shoyu soaked pierce

347
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:17,291
and your fingerprints matched.

348
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,391
We just got an arrest warrant,

349
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,391
so we charged into the restroom to come and get you!

350
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:26,791
You... You guys are police officers?

351
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,491
Did you forget?

352
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,892
We've met once before, haven't we?

353
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:38,991
MPD Section One Violent Crimes Division three, Miwako Sato!

354
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,292
And Wataru Takagi of the same department!

355
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,091
We were actually told to stay outside the shop

356
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:50,891
and keep an eye on you until the arrest warrant was issued.

357
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,391
But we didn't want to risk you

358
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,591
taking the employee here hostage or something so.

359
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:59,491
Besides, if we enter the shop when you already know our faces,

360
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,591
it's possible that you would flee on us.

361
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:06,091
That's why we disguised ourselves and put on an act

362
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:08,991
with the cooperation of Conan and the others!

363
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:12,591
Well, it did look like you were really enjoying yourselves too, though.

364
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:16,891
Besides, you were the ones who told us about the truth of the case!

365
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,891
It... It wasn't me.

366
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,391
It was rather, Masumi here...

367
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:22,392
Huh?

368
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:25,791
Where'd Masumi go?

369
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,691
She just left

370
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,691
saying she had something to do.

371
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:34,491
What? Did Mari leave?

372
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:37,991
I didn't get to return her handkerchief to her again.

373
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,391
What? Handkerchief?

374
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:43,091
Yeah. She forgot it here the last time she came.

375
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,491
Right, sonny.

376
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:47,291
I'm sorry, but will you go give this back to her for me?

377
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,592
Yes, okay.

378
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,591
I didn't mean to kill her.

379
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:58,191
I just wanted to see that lady go pale.

380
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,592
Yes, yes. Go tell that to the police!

381
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:06,891
Gosh.

382
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,691
It seems that he tried to leave a trace of the safe

383
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,591
being forced opened at the victim's house.

384
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,491
Only because he didn't want to be specified as the one

385
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,591
who heard about the pierced earrings at this shop

386
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,491
and committed the crime.

387
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,791
At any rate, let's hurry on back to the station

388
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:27,691
and record his defense statement.

389
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:31,491
We've got our hard work-out to do tonight too, don't we?

390
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:35,191
If you want to work out, why don't you go to the gym or something?

391
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,391
What?

392
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:40,092
I... I guess I'll do that.

393
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:42,892
Idiot.

394
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:08,091
See! There's an embroidery on the handkerchief, right?

395
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:10,291
It says "Mari"!

396
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:14,691
No, this isn't "Mari", but "Mary".

397
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:18,591
Which means that's not Masumi Sera's handkerchief

398
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:22,992
but the one of the girl who was in the picture with her.

399
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:25,491
Huh?

400
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:27,891
What made me think so?

401
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:32,592
It could be that Masumi Sera's real name is Mary too and yet.

402
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:38,091
Which means I met her elsewhere and heard her name.

403
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:40,692
But, where on earth was it?

404
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:45,992
"Next Episode"

405
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,891
What's that?

406
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:52,592
A kind looking grandpa and grandma used to run this shop.

407
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,091
It seems that the person who was found dead by the bridge

408
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,991
was also wearing brown shoes.

409
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,591
An insurance salesman came at noon.

410
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:05,291
Which means he was planning to drop by after work.

411
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:09,091
Yes, it's the soil of the shrine in back.

412
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:14,492
Next Conan, "Wonder Boy"
