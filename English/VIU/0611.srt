1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,847
Hey. Gramps!

2
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:20,747
I think there's a residence called Inbushi near here,

3
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:22,047
but do you know where it is?

4
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,047
Inubushi?

5
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,647
What do you want with them?

6
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:31,447
We're going over to help them get rid of a puppy's curse.

7
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,647
I'll be frank with you.

8
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,747
Forget it.

9
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,847
If you stick nose into it out of curiosity,

10
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:41,247
you'll be badly burned.

11
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:45,547
And? Where's the house?

12
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,247
You see that house with the castle-like roof

13
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:52,247
part way up that mountain?

14
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:55,047
That's the Inubushi Residence.

15
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,947
It's a house cursed by a dog.

16
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:03,547
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

17
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,047
Tears are the start of all dramas.

18
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,847
What lies behind the mystery of the burning dog

19
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,647
that attacks the cursed Inubushi family?

20
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,247
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,247
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,847
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,304
This is a case that Heiji Hattori had brought along.

24
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,904
The adopted children of Mr. Tsunechika Inubushi,

25
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:04,804
the chairman of the Inubushi Group, who died five years ago,

26
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,704
begin dying of bizarre causes one after the other.

27
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:09,604
Moreover, it is said that these are the doings

28
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:12,704
of a monster who resembles a dog enveloped in flames.

29
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:13,804
Since one of the adopted children

30
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:16,104
was Kazuha's mother's acquaintance,

31
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:19,204
we went along with Heiji to ask for the details.

32
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,504
Surprisingly, the person we went to visit,

33
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,204
although the Japanese characters were different,

34
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,304
was named Shinichi Kudo, and had the same name as me.

35
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:29,304
However, even before we got a chance to talk to him,

36
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,104
somebody had killed and framed him

37
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,704
as having committed suicide using a charcoal stove.

38
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:36,804
What on earth is the identity of the culprit

39
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:38,804
who dares to act as a possessed spirit?

40
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:42,004
And what is the meaning of the pearl

41
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:45,104
that Shinichi s corpse had in his mouth.

42
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:49,904
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

43
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,704
"(Will-O'-the-Wisp Chapter)"

44
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:56,104
Hey, Heiji. Is it true?

45
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:58,304
That story about the pearl that dropped out of the mouth

46
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,504
of the corpse of one of the

47
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,904
adopted children of the Inbushi family, called Shinichi.

48
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,804
It's true.

49
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,204
He probably bit off the pearl

50
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,704
that was attached to his necktie pin just before he died

51
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,404
with hope of leaving behind proof of the culprit.

52
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:13,804
Right?

53
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:17,204
If the saliva of that man is also on the necktie pin,

54
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:20,304
it could be a dying message.

55
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,804
It could be. You mean it's not definite?

56
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:26,504
No. Although saliva was found on it,

57
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,804
there is no trace of him having bitten it.

58
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,704
So, maybe the pearl

59
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,604
wasn't attached well enough to begin with or...

60
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:37,204
The culprit had a message he wanted to relay

61
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:40,704
and deliberately put the pearl into his mouth.

62
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,904
Right, big brother Heiji?

63
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:44,304
Right!

64
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,104
You two sure get along like always!

65
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:50,604
Really, it's just like you're Heiji's assistant!

66
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,404
Cut out that assistant stuff.

67
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,904
Either way, it's the doing of someone

68
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:58,004
who has a whole of grudge against the Inubushi family.

69
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:01,504
After all, Shinichi after giving up his portion of the inheritance

70
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:05,904
returned to Tokyo, and yet was killed.

71
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:09,804
Right. Satomi, the wife of elderly tycoon,

72
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,204
Tsunechika Inubushi, inherits his estate,

73
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:14,104
then falls ill.

74
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,404
If someone is trying to get rid of the number of adopted children

75
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:19,904
in order to increase the amount of the inheritance to be inherited,

76
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,504
Shinichi would've been counted out

77
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,004
because he gave up his portion.

78
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,904
If I remember correctly, he had eight adopted children, right?

79
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,004
Yes, although they all had different mothers.

80
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,004
So, it could be that a person

81
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:33,304
who is not his real child among the eight children,

82
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:36,104
and is trying to clear a grudge or something?

83
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:38,204
Even if it were to be his real child,

84
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,704
maybe that person could also be holding a grudge

85
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,704
because he left them be without looking after them.

86
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:46,604
And, who of the eight passed away?

87
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:50,004
Shinichi who was killed under the pretense

88
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,804
of having committed suicide by using a charcoal stove.

89
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,104
Before that, a lady by the name of Miwako

90
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,104
who drowned in the swamp.

91
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:58,804
The grass around the swamp where there was nothing

92
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,804
that could've caught fire seems to have burned.

93
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:03,404
And the first one who died was a man called Keiji,

94
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,104
"Keiji Inubushi" -who fell from on top a cliff!

95
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:08,404
It's said that he was chased by a demon dog engulfed in flames!

96
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,704
If you're scared, you should've stayed back home.

97
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,304
But if you hear the start of a scary story,

98
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,204
you want to find out what happens in the end.

99
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:22,704
I thought the same too, but I'm scared after all.

100
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,804
Hey, it's too late to say you want to go back from here, you know.

101
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,404
No! Go back!

102
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:30,204
There's a cliff up ahead so you'd better stop quickly!

103
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:40,204
What?

104
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,604
Look out.

105
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,204
Didn't you see the sign a little way back?

106
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,904
Be careful, will you?

107
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:51,604
Just the other day, somebody fell over and died too!

108
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,904
Oh, well...

109
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:54,504
we're on our way to investigate that case

110
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:56,804
and are headed for the Inubushi Residence.

111
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,004
"Miyuki Inubushi(28), Adopted Child of Inubushi"

112
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:01,804
I'm a family member of the Inubushi's.

113
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,204
It really looks like a Japanese castle.

114
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:12,104
It seems that the people around here call it the Inubushi Castle.

115
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:16,204
It doesn't look like a residence that is cursed by a demon dog!

116
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,304
I guess not.

117
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,404
What?

118
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:28,604
-How cute. -It's an Akita dog!

119
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:30,304
No, Hachi!

120
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,704
These people and the others officers who have come here

121
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:36,204
to investigate the accident big brother Keiji got into.

122
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,704
No, I'm not an officer.

123
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,804
You're the one that's no good, Miyuki!

124
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,504
When dogs bark for nothing, calling their name

125
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,104
"Takako Inubushi (47)" -or touching them

126
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,904
will make them mistakenly think that they're being praised.

127
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,104
How many times do I have to tell you before you understand this?

128
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,604
I'm sorry, Takako.

129
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:58,604
Never mind that, what did you want, officer?

130
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,504
Just the other day, another police officer

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,604
came and left after saying that

132
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:04,204
it was concluded to be an accident.

133
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,104
Oh, well, I'm not an officer.

134
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:09,404
However, something that doesn't look like an accident occurred,

135
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:13,004
so we've come all this way to ask you about it!

136
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,604
-Right, officer? -You.

137
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:21,304
Could you be talking of Shinichi who died in Tokyo?

138
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:24,704
Before he left here, Shinichi said,

139
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,304
a bunch of nonsense about somebody

140
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:29,104
using a cursed demon dog that is engulfed in flames

141
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,604
to annihilate the bloodline of Inubushi from its roots.

142
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,704
Is that what you're referring to?

143
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:36,504
But there's no such thing as a curse, so no need for worry.

144
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,904
Besides, if mother hears of this, it will make her sad.

145
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,104
Is Satomi here?

146
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:46,504
I was under the impression that she'd be in the hospital.

147
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,004
She's here.

148
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,604
Although she's bed-ridden and can hardly talk.

149
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:55,504
Cerebral infarction.

150
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:59,704
She's been this way, ever since she collapsed last month.

151
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:02,504
It's better for her to be hospitalized.

152
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:03,804
But, since she's already quite aged,

153
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,204
we decided to take care of her here.

154
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:09,604
Oh, I'm Tomoaki Inubushi.

155
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:13,204
I work as a doctor at the Inubushi Hospital near here.

156
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:16,704
Then, are you one of the eight adopted children too?

157
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,204
Yes. When I was at a loss what to do

158
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,904
after the hospital that I previously worked for went bankrupt,

159
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:25,204
Mother Satomi here came to my rescue.

160
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,204
And?

161
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,204
Didn't Satomi mention anything about

162
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:30,504
who seemed to be an imposter?

163
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,704
I wonder... not especially.

164
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:38,704
Wasn't that man called Shinichi the imposter?

165
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,604
Terrified over a demon dog rumor that could never be,

166
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:45,304
he's a betrayer who left the Inubushi house, you see!

167
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:48,104
How could you talk rough like that Yoshiya,

168
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:49,804
in front of mother!

169
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:53,804
She's not listening. She's asleep, isn't she?

170
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,604
One person is missing.

171
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:00,304
The eight adopted children! Three died, right?

172
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,304
So there should be five people left.

173
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:07,304
But over here there are only Miyuki, Takako, Tomoaki

174
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:10,304
and the one who just came Yoshiya, a total of four people!

175
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:13,104
True. There should be one more person.

176
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,804
Don't tell me that the person has a scar on the face

177
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:18,604
and wears a strange looking mask?

178
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,104
This isn't the Inugami family, you know.

179
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,104
The other one left is Saki!

180
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,004
She's picking up some clothes

181
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,704
at a cleaners a little far from here for me.

182
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:31,004
Well, why not drink some tea while you wait for her?

183
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,904
I guess it's difficult to listen to our story

184
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,304
unless all of us are gathered here, so...

185
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:37,704
While you're at it, why don't you tell them

186
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,704
about the demon dog story

187
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,904
that is handed down for generations in the Inubushi family?

188
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,404
Handed down for generations?

189
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,804
Burned it?

190
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,904
The ancestors of this house burned a dog?

191
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:53,604
Yes. It seems to date back to the Meiji Era, though.

192
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:56,504
All of the townspeople were helping to look for the only daughter

193
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,704
of the Inubushi family, who suddenly disappeared,

194
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:02,004
when the dog that the Inubushi family were keeping appeared

195
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:03,904
holding the daughter who was all scratched up

196
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,804
and on the verge of death in its mouth.

197
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:09,804
The angry owner whipped the dog repeatedly

198
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:13,804
and on top of it all, he set the dog on fire.

199
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:17,204
But, later, when the daughter came back to life,

200
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:19,304
after hearing that the dog had actually come to her rescue

201
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,504
when she was lost and fell in the mountains,

202
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,904
the owner who regretted what he did,

203
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,604
built a fine grave for the dog.

204
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,304
However, several days later, a fire occurred

205
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:33,404
and only the owner couldn't escape in time and died.

206
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,704
Since then, word went around that the Inubushi family

207
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,704
was cursed by a demon dog engulfed in flames.

208
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:40,704
It's like a story of long ago.

209
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,504
Then, does that grave actually exist?

210
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:44,604
Yes.

211
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,304
Under the cliff that your car almost fell from this afternoon.

212
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:51,004
Would you like me to take you there right now?

213
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,104
True.

214
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:57,404
The gallant beloved dog of the Inubushi family.

215
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:00,604
"Fusataro" lies here, it says.

216
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:03,804
So if a dog engulfed in fire appears,

217
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,404
it's understandable that anybody would think

218
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,904
it's the curse of Fusataro.

219
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:10,104
We'd better offer our prayers so that it won't curse us!

220
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,404
Same here.

221
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,704
There could never be such a thing as a curse.

222
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:17,804
Is the cliff that Keiji fell over this cliff?

223
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,804
Yes.

224
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:22,704
Right above this grave.

225
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,904
Saki?

226
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,504
Get a hold of yourself, Saki!

227
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:42,104
Saki, you mean the last of the adopted children?

228
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:45,204
Dog... burned.

229
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,204
Burned dog?

230
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:49,904
Kazuha! Call the ambulance and the police!

231
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,604
We'll go together with Pops Kogoro by car

232
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,604
to the top of the cliff!

233
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:55,004
What? You mean you want only us girls to wait here

234
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,404
in a place like this?

235
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,004
If you want to go to the top of the cliff,

236
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,704
it's faster to take the animal path up, than by car.

237
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:02,604
Okay, take us there then!

238
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:05,704
Ran, wait here with Pops Kogoro and the others then!

239
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:07,704
Okay.

240
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,104
Okay! Off to the top of the cliff!

241
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:21,404
It's burning.

242
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:23,704
There's no smell of oil.

243
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,904
It looks almost like a dog on fire walked through here.

244
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,304
Yeah.

245
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,609
Footprints that were on fire?

246
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:44,209
You're saying that you found something like that up on the cliff?

247
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,909
Yeah, that's right.

248
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,209
20m in the foreground from the edge of the cliff,

249
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,609
there were traces of fire here and there.

250
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:54,209
Just as if a demon dog engulfed in flames ran through the area.

251
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,609
What?

252
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:58,909
But, you didn't get to see the demon dog in question, did you?

253
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,209
I'll bet somebody just poured oil over the area

254
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,009
and set fire to make it look like a demon dog really exists!

255
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,309
No. There wasn't any smell of oil.

256
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,109
The space between the fire was greater

257
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,009
the closer you got to the edge of the cliff too,

258
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,009
and the fire got bigger too,

259
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,509
so it looked like something that was burning pass through there

260
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:17,209
as it got bigger.

261
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,309
Isn't that right, Miyuki?

262
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,309
Yes.

263
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:24,109
So the cursed demon dog...

264
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,209
Does exist after all.

265
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,909
Saki who fell from the cliff said,

266
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,109
"Dog engulfed in flames" too.

267
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:31,409
Idiot!

268
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:34,309
There could be no such thing as a demon dog in this world!

269
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,809
It's a trick!

270
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,109
Somebody's just trying to make it look as if a demon dog exists!

271
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:43,309
In order to put the blame on the demon dog for their crime.

272
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,109
Exactly!

273
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,609
I mean this is a time when the world is talking about

274
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:49,209
TV broadcasts going digital,

275
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,109
how can you possibly make us fuss over a demon dog?

276
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:53,909
It's really making me "dizzy dear".

277
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,109
Inspector Yamamura!

278
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:01,709
Oh, did you catch on to the play on words I just mentioned?

279
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,309
Who's this chum?

280
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,209
He's an officer from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station,

281
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,309
although he may not look it.

282
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,109
So, this is Gunma Prefecture.

283
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,909
And...

284
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,309
how is Saki who fell off the cliff doing?

285
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,809
Well, I heard that she was taken by ambulance to a hospital.

286
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,909
That's our hospital.

287
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,809
I got a call on my cell phone

288
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,409
and was told she died in the ambulance.

289
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,809
Oh, no.

290
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,409
I don't know who's manipulating the demon dog

291
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,609
but it's definite that somebody's

292
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,009
picking a fight with the Inubushi family.

293
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:38,309
That's true. Out of all the eight adopted children,

294
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,209
half of us, four have already died.

295
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,609
Then, for the time being, out of the four that now remain,

296
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,209
will the three of you who are here give us your alibis?

297
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,809
Tell us where and what you were doing around 19:00

298
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,209
when Saki fell over the cliff.

299
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:56,109
Miyuki has a concrete alibi because she was with us

300
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,009
when we went to look at the grave of the dog

301
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,609
located below the cliff!

302
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,209
At about 19:00, I was taking a bath.

303
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:07,009
Since Saki didn't come back for a while,

304
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,009
I went outside to check on her.

305
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,309
She still loses her way a lot even now so...

306
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,709
I was beside mother checking her body temperature,

307
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,409
blood pressure and feeding her liquid food.

308
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,909
Well, but since she's bed-ridden.

309
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:25,809
I can't have her testify for me, though.

310
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,209
As for you two,

311
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,109
you don't seem to have anyone who can testify for you either.

312
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:31,309
No.

313
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,609
Normally there are three people helping me,

314
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:37,409
but they've taken leave to visit their families.

315
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,509
Mr. Mouri! It's the job of the police to ask that question!

316
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:43,109
Please don't take my job away from me!

317
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:46,809
Oh, isn't he a police officer?

318
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:50,209
Oh, no. I lost the chance to introduce myself.

319
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,209
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

320
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:55,509
-Mou... -Mouri?

321
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:56,809
Kogoro?

322
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,909
Are you the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri?

323
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,209
Yes, well...

324
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,409
Huh? The atmosphere's changed.

325
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,109
You just surprised us a bit.

326
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,009
Before he left the house, the late Shinichi said...

327
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,209
You'd better give yourselves up

328
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,109
because he asked an acquaintance police officer to investigate

329
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,609
and to solve the mystery

330
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,109
of what is happening in the Inubushi family.

331
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,309
But I had no idea that it was going to be

332
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,609
the renown Sleeping Kogoro.

333
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,909
Well, I'm the one who actually asked to investigate the incident.

334
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,809
By the way, the day Shinichi

335
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,409
was killed in his residence in Tokyo,

336
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,409
I suppose there's no one here that went to Tokyo, is there?

337
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,309
All four of us were in Tokyo.

338
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:45,909
We went to persuade him to come back to the Inubushi family.

339
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,409
It seemed that he suspected one of us,

340
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,509
so we wanted to ask him why he thought so too.

341
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,209
Well, but he was so afraid that he didn't tell us anything.

342
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:59,709
It was as if he was saying that the culprit is among us.

343
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,009
We heard about Shinichi's death

344
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,609
as soon as we got back from Saki who we asked

345
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:06,209
to keep watch over the answer phone.

346
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,609
Which means that all four of you

347
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,809
were together all the while you were in Tokyo?

348
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,609
No. We all went together, but we all came back separately.

349
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:17,709
By the way, isn't it about time you tell us

350
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:21,009
about what you found out about Shinichi's case?

351
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,909
You also mentioned that the accident of Keiji and Miwako

352
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:25,709
that occurred previously had some connection

353
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,709
with the chain of events that is happening too.

354
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,309
We don't know yet if this has any connection to the incident,

355
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,409
but Shinichi had the pearl that

356
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,109
was on his necktie pin in his mouth!

357
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,509
What seems to be the matter?

358
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:46,809
Oh, nothing. There was one near Keiji who fell over the cliff like Saki.

359
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,609
A pachinko ball.

360
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,209
A pachinko ball?

361
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:53,209
That old man used to love playing pachinko

362
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:56,109
so I though t it just fell out of his pocket or something.

363
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,909
Besides, after that,

364
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:02,109
even on the surface of the swamp that Miwako drowned in,

365
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,009
there was a ping pong ball.

366
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,709
Balls, balls and more balls.

367
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,409
So, the pearl is not a dying message.

368
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,109
It seems to be a message that the culprit deliberately left behind!

369
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,609
-Then, maybe... -That's the same too?

370
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,209
We found it after Saki was taken to the hospital in the ambulance.

371
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,809
It was rolling on the ground near the dog's grave, a marble!

372
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,209
A marble?

373
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,809
Do you have that with you now?

374
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,709
We thought it was an offering, so we left it on the grave.

375
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,509
Okay, we'll go take a look at that marble,

376
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,709
so will you come with us too, officer?

377
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,509
I've got some things I'd like to ask you too.

378
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:42,009
Yeah.

379
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,509
Kazuha and the rest of you, stay still and wait here!

380
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,009
Ran, you too!

381
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:48,109
What? We'll go with you too!

382
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,109
We're the ones who found it, after all!

383
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:51,609
You can come if you want!

384
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,509
If you want to see the demon dog!

385
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,909
I... I guess not.

386
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,609
We'll wait here.

387
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,509
I... I'm sorry to have barged in on you like this,

388
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,009
and yet to be served dinner.

389
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,209
No problem, don't worry about it.

390
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,509
I wonder if Heiji and the others will be back before dawn?

391
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,009
I wonder.

392
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,909
More than that, we're really going to have it tough from now on

393
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:21,709
since Saki was the one who made preparations

394
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:24,609
and put things away most of the time.

395
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,909
Can I help you with something?

396
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,809
Then, could you go feed Hachi for me?

397
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,609
Okay.

398
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,709
I asked Takako and the others to do it, but they refused.

399
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,609
Why?

400
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,809
It seems that Takako is used to the dog and yet?

401
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,309
Yes. It seems that she had a dog before she came here,

402
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,109
so she knows a lot but...

403
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,509
it seems she's got her hands full with

404
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,109
making arrangements for the funeral and all.

405
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:58,209
Tomoaki had been bitten by a dog in the past

406
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:59,709
and really hates dogs!

407
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:03,709
Since he's always jittery, Hachi really barks at him too.

408
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,909
And Yoshiya's allergic to dogs.

409
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,209
When near dogs, he can't stop sneezing

410
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,809
and comes down with runny nose, he says.

411
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:15,809
That's why it used to be Takako, Saki or I who fed the dog.

412
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,809
-Could I ask you to do it for me? -Okay! Sure!

413
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,909
Where's the doghouse?

414
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,109
It's a bit far away.

415
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,409
Far? Don't tell me that it's outside the house?

416
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:30,109
Don't worry! It's towards the edge of house,

417
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,109
but it's fenced in so even the demon dog can't go inside!

418
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:36,709
Oh, I see.

419
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:45,909
Boy, it sure is a large yard.

420
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,509
Yes.

421
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,909
Isn't that it, the doghouse?

422
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,709
Right! Hachi's there too!

423
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,809
Hachi! We brought you dinner!

424
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,709
Eat it all now!

425
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,109
-He's so cute! -Yes!

426
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,109
It'd be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

427
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:17,809
What's the matter?

428
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,109
What's that?

429
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,609
Isn't there something glowing over there?

430
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,909
Yes.

431
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,309
This place is full of books on magic!

432
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,409
There's a magic circle drawn on the floor too.

433
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,509
I'm sure that someone cast a curse on the dog here.

434
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,509
The culprit will probably not get caught.

435
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,809
After all we're going after a Black Magic Magician,

436
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,009
who can curse a dog, you know?

437
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:23,409
Next Conan,

"Onions"

442
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,309
What will come out if you peel an onion?

443
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,709
Nothing's going to come out.

444
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,509
Tears are.
