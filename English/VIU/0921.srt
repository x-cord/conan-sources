00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:18,214
Thank you so much for towing our car.

2
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:21,114
The mechanic will have an easier time finding your car

3
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:22,914
"Ryohei Saeki (24)" -at the station up ahead

4
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,314
than in the middle of the mountains.

5
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:29,814
We were planning on stopping there to pick up groceries anyway.

6
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:33,814
Are you guys going camping?

7
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:36,014
"Takahiro Komada (22)" -Our college lab

8
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,814
always goes camping together.

00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:40,614
"Shoji Goto (50)" -Our professor enjoys this kind of thing.

10
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:48,514
"Haruka Inoue (23)" -Komada, you should get a smartphone already.

11
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,814
I will once this one breaks.

12
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:55,814
It takes too long to exchange data with you.

13
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:57,714
Try putting yourself in our shoes.

14
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:59,414
Sorry.

15
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,714
Oh, right.

16
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:03,014
This time we're also celebrating

17
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:05,014
the publication of our professor's paper.

18
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:07,214
Really? That's amazing.

19
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,414
The world must be ending

20
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,414
if that perverted drunkard is being recognized.

21
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,814
Haruka, he'll hear you.

22
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,314
He won't wake up.

23
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:18,514
He always gets like this when he's drunk.

24
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:22,214
Besides, it's not like you guys like the professor either.

25
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,414
Hey, what are you talking about?

26
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:27,314
Maybe you all actually think,

27
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:31,114
if only the professor would disappear from this world.

28
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,614
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

29
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:44,614
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

30
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:46,614
The conversation inside the car is rather ominous!

31
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:48,714
I hope nothing happens!

32
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:50,214
He sees through the one and only truth.

"The Murderous Carpool"

36
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:45,057
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:51,505
Excuse me. These are for you.

38
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,205
You didn't need to.

39
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:57,305
I wanted to thank you for your help.

40
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,405
Where's your friend?

41
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,605
Saeki? He's over there.

42
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:12,305
Looks like we're leaving soon.

43
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:13,905
We should go.

44
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,505
Hey, wait.

45
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,705
Mouri, are you all right?

46
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:20,505
Yes, thanks to you.

47
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,905
That's good.

48
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,505
Saeki, I'm putting some bags in the car.

49
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,405
Oh, thanks.

50
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:28,405
I was just thinking about bringing the car around...

51
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,505
Professor?

52
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,005
Professor, are you all right?

53
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:40,405
Darn it! His phone's stuck!

54
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,105
What should we do?

55
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:48,505
What happened?

56
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,605
His phone was stuck.

57
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:51,905
The strap was caught on his neck.

58
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:56,405
He's dead.

59
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:58,405
Did something happen?

60
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,805
Ran, call the police.

61
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,705
Got it.

62
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,905
Everyone else, please get out of the car.

63
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,005
Don't touch anything at the crime scene.

64
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,205
It's wet.

65
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,205
"Metropolitan Police Department"

66
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,605
So after you returned from shopping

67
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:36,005
at this store you always stop at,

68
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,805
Goto, who had been sleeping inside the car,

69
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,305
slid down in his seat,

70
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,705
causing his phone strap to strangle him,

71
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,305
resulting in his death?

72
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,105
Yes, that's right.

73
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:50,605
Komada, you were the last person to get out of the car.

74
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,905
Yes.

75
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,605
While getting out of the car,

76
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,705
I thought the air inside was a little cold,

77
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,705
so I draped a blanket over the professor.

78
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:02,905
Did you notice anything then?

79
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,805
Anything out of the ordinary?

80
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:10,005
Come to think of it, I didn't recognize the air cushion

81
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:12,805
that the professor was using.

82
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,405
He said he'd hurt his back recently,

83
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:18,005
so maybe he bought it for today.

84
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:24,905
Inoue, you returned to the car before entering the store.

85
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,105
That's right.

86
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:29,105
I forgot my phone, so I went to go get it.

87
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,005
But the professor was asleep.

88
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,105
He was snoring loudly.

89
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,305
Not that I went inside and got a good look at him.

90
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:39,905
Isn't that right, miss?

91
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,405
Yes.

92
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,505
What?

93
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,205
You were with her?

94
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,605
Yeah. I dropped my wallet inside the van,

95
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,805
so I followed Inoue.

96
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:56,605
My wallet was on the seat, so I left immediately,

97
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,605
but I did hear some loud snoring.

98
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:03,305
In other words, he fell from his seat after that.

99
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:08,105
Finally, Saeki, you went to the convenience store next door

100
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:11,405
to buy cigarettes after you finished shopping?

101
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,005
Yeah, I'd just run out.

102
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:18,305
I returned to the car after having a smoke over there.

103
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:23,105
We saw him smoking cigarettes. Right, Ran?

104
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:27,705
Yeah. From right around here, when we gave them our gift.

105
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:31,605
Come to think of it, did Goto always drink that much?

106
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:35,005
Every time he'd be plastered by the time we arrived.

107
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,305
He said he couldn't sleep unless he drank.

108
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:42,005
The professor took sleeping pills,

109
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,905
but he was a shallow sleeper.

110
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:46,305
Alcohol and sleeping pills, huh?

111
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,305
So that's why there aren't any signs of a struggle

112
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,405
even though he was strangled.

113
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:55,405
Anyway, it seems strange to me that Goto's phone was found open

114
00:07:55,405 --> 00:08:01,405
between the seat and headrest when the body was discovered.

115
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:04,505
Goto was probably making a call.

116
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,805
A call?

117
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:09,505
It's possible the drunked Goto tried to place a call,

118
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:15,505
but his hand slipped, and his phone ended up in that gap.

119
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:19,205
Maybe it was that.

120
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,605
Do you know something about that?

121
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:26,605
I got a call from the professor while I was shopping.

122
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:30,205
I thought he wanted me to get something,

123
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:33,605
but he didn't answer, so I hung up.

124
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,205
"Shoji Goto"

125
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:38,205
I knew it!

126
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:42,905
Takagi, investigate Goto's call history immediately.

127
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,505
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,805
He got what was coming to him.

129
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:49,205
Haruka, behave.

130
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:53,205
Saeki, aren't you relieved?

131
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:57,005
Now that the professor who refused to give you credits is gone,

132
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:00,205
you'll get that job you were promised.

133
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,705
That has nothing to do with this!

134
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,305
And, Komada,

135
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:06,605
the professor was awfully verbally abusive towards you.

136
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,505
How did you really feel about him?

137
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,005
No way in particular.

138
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,305
Well, you complained

139
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:14,405
that you wouldn't forgive the professor for sexually harassing you!

140
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,805
That's right. That's why I feel relieved.

141
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,705
You must feel the same way.

142
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:23,105
Don't you remember what he said last time he was drunk?

143
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,605
Listen up.

144
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:30,005
You idiots should shut up and listen to me.

145
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:34,605
I can change your futures with a single word.

146
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,205
That was...

147
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,505
Honestly, I couldn't take it anymore.

148
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,105
In the first place, he...

149
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:46,505
It sounds like all three of them

150
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,705
felt quite resentful towards the professor.

151
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:53,205
We'll need to investigate carefully.

152
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:56,105
Inspector.

153
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:57,705
Takagi, how did it go?

154
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:03,205
We found a call placed to Saeki in Goto's phone history.

155
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,505
We're certain it was during the time he was shopping.

156
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:12,905
Mouri, did anyone approach the car while you were here?

157
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,305
No. I was next to the car the whole time

158
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,705
since I was waiting for the roadside assistance,

159
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:19,705
but I didn't see anyone.

160
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:24,305
If Goto died after placing the call,

161
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:28,105
and no one approached the car after that...

162
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,505
Then it must've been an accident.

163
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,905
Hey, don't you think it's strange?

164
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:35,305
Conan, you shouldn't be in there!

165
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:37,105
Oh, sorry.

166
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:41,005
I dropped something inside the car.

167
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:44,105
Gosh. You're always barging into crime scenes.

168
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:48,105
So, what's strange?

169
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,805
The air cushion Goto was using.

170
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:52,805
Huh?

171
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,205
What's so strange about this?

172
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:01,705
They said he may have bought it because he hurt his back.

173
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:06,705
But there's a hole in it even though it's brand new.

174
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:10,905
Yeah. I was wondering about that, too.

175
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,105
I thought it had a hole because it was old.

176
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:18,805
And when I first looked at it,

177
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,005
the surface of the cushion was slightly damp.

178
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:25,905
There weren't any other wet spots on the seat.

179
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,905
Isn't that strange?

180
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:30,705
There's nothing strange about it.

181
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:34,305
It was damp because Goto spilled liquor on it.

182
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:38,205
And the cushion was defective, so a hole opened while he was asleep.

183
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:42,105
It made him lose his balance and fall from his seat.

184
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,905
Well? You got a problem with that?

185
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:45,805
Now, now, Mouri.

186
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,005
This was definitely an accident.

187
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,605
An accident!

188
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:51,105
No, he's wrong.

189
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,905
Using that, they could've made the victim fall,

190
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,305
even from a distance.

191
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,105
But without any evidence,

192
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:02,205
this will be treated as an accident.

193
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,305
Is there anything?

194
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,505
Anything that would definitively prove they did it?

195
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,805
What's that?

196
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,005
That's it!

197
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:16,105
This means that they must still have it on them.

198
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:20,005
The conclusive evidence the culprit used in their trick!

199
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,528
It's probably safe to assume there was no foul play.

200
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,828
Yes. They seem to have motives,

201
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:36,328
but those three couldn't have killed him.

202
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,128
Excuse me.

203
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:41,028
How long do we have to wait?

204
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,328
We'd like to leave now.

205
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:47,028
We have people we need to call.

206
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,428
Don't worry.

207
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:51,728
After reviewing the crime scene, all uncertainties have been...

208
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,828
It's become clear to me

209
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:05,128
that this is a murder made to look like an accident.

210
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:12,228
Goto didn't accidentally fall from his seat.

211
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:14,928
He was made to fall by the culprit.

212
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:20,328
Didn't you just say none of them could have killed him?

213
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,428
At first, that's what I believed,

214
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,928
but after examining the inside of the car,

215
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,528
I realized the trick the culprit used.

216
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,328
Hold on.

217
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:34,228
You think one of us killed him?

218
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,628
We were together the whole time.

219
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,728
We couldn't have killed the professor who was sleeping in the car.

220
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,928
It's not impossible.

221
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,328
All they needed to do was slip the phone with the strap

222
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:51,028
through the gap between the headrest and seat towards the back.

223
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,728
Even if that's true,

224
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:56,328
wasn't it a coincidence that Goto fell from his seat?

225
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:59,528
The culprit set up what you might call a timing device

226
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:02,628
that caused Goto to automatically fall from his seat

227
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:06,628
even if no one else was present...

228
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:11,828
using the rubber air cushion and dry ice.

229
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:15,428
Dry ice sublimates from a solid directly into a gas,

230
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:19,028
causing its volume to expand by a factor of 800.

231
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:22,928
The culprit packed dry ice inside the air cushion

232
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,228
and hid it on the seat.

233
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:29,528
As time passed, the cushion began to expand like a balloon

234
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:34,128
to a size large enough to cause Goto to fall from his seat.

235
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,328
The cushion was damp

236
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:38,328
because the low temperature of the dry ice

237
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:41,328
cooled the moisture in the air,

238
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,328
causing it to condense on its surface.

239
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:48,828
The cushion continued to expand after Goto fell,

240
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:52,728
and once it could no longer contain the gas, it burst.

241
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:57,128
Naturally, they experimented many times

242
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,428
to determine the exact amount they should use,

243
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:03,128
so it would all have turned to gas by the time the body was discovered.

244
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:07,128
That would certainly leave no evidence.

245
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:11,628
But isn't it difficult to transport dry ice?

246
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:15,728
That's why the culprit used a certain piece of outdoor equipment.

247
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,128
That's it! A cooler!

248
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,428
Yes.

249
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:24,628
Using a cooler allowed the culprit to preserve the dry ice

250
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,728
until they needed it.

251
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,228
Isn't that right?

252
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:33,028
The individual with the cooler who used this trick...

253
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,228
Komada!

254
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,728
You created an excuse to remain in the car

255
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,728
and passed the open phone with strap

256
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:46,428
through the gap beneath the headrest towards the back.

257
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:51,728
Then you draped a blanket over Goto's legs

258
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:54,328
in order to hide the dry ice-filled cushion,

259
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,928
and went shopping as though nothing had happened.

260
00:15:57,928 --> 00:16:00,528
I'm sure you calculated how large the cushion would expand,

261
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,328
and how long it would take to burst

262
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,528
and bought one accordingly.

263
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,928
Why me?

264
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:08,428
Surely you don't think I did it

265
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,828
just because I approached the professor.

266
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:13,628
And you said I passed the professor's phone

267
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:16,728
through the gap and over the back of his seat.

268
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:21,728
Have you forgotten that the professor called Saeki?

269
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,428
If his phone were back there,

270
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,728
he couldn't have called anyone.

271
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:31,528
I never said it was the professor's phone that was used.

272
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,428
What are you...

273
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:38,028
I'm saying you're the one who called Saeki.

274
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,728
You swapped out your phone for Goto's

275
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:44,928
and used it to fabricate your alibi.

276
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,128
In other words,

277
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:50,928
the phone attached to the strap that strangled Goto was yours.

278
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:57,128
That's why you behaved strangely.

279
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:02,728
Conan told me that when you saw Saeki return to the van,

280
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:07,828
you returned to the car while carrying heavy bags full of groceries.

281
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:14,428
Looks like we're leaving soon.

282
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:15,728
We should go.

283
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,528
Hey, wait.

284
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:20,028
Saeki, I'm putting some bags in the car.

285
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,828
Oh, thanks.

286
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,128
I was just thinking about bringing the car around...

287
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,128
Professor?

288
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:31,228
Inoue, you were with him.

289
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,728
Didn't you wonder why he didn't have Saeki bring the car

290
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:38,128
in front of the store instead of carrying so many heavy bags?

291
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,928
Well, yes.

292
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:44,628
But, Komada, you went out of your way to carry the bags.

293
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,328
Why is that?

294
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:50,028
There's one reason you returned.

295
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,528
It's because you needed to discover Goto's body with someone else,

296
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:54,728
approach the body first,

297
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:59,228
and swap out your phone, which you used for the murder

298
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:04,228
for Goto's, which you used to fabricate your alibi.

299
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:08,828
As the only other person with a flip phone like Goto's,

300
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:11,428
only you could've used this trick.

301
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:13,228
If you wanted to save Goto,

302
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:17,428
you simply needed to pass the stuck phone through the gap.

303
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,628
I knew something was off

304
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:23,128
when you deliberately removed the phone from the strap.

305
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:26,528
You probably planned to reattach it,

306
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:27,828
but you gave up on the idea

307
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:32,528
when Conan and I entered the car unexpectedly quickly.

308
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,328
You're making this all up!

309
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:40,528
Even if it was dry ice, there's no evidence it was used!

310
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:44,728
If I'm the culprit, show me the evidence!

311
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,328
I could say the same thing.

312
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,428
What?

313
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,728
Officer Takagi, how did it go?

314
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:56,928
I didn't find the damage you described on Goto's phone.

315
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,828
Damage?

316
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:04,028
And aren't these pieces of plastic?

317
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:08,028
Yes. They were stuck to the blanket.

318
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:12,828
When Goto fell, the phone dangling over the back

319
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:15,428
struck a metal piece of the seat.

320
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:19,328
The shock sent those pieces of plastic flying.

321
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:24,428
Komada, using an old phone came back to bite you.

322
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:34,328
As we just heard in Officer Takagi's report,

323
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:39,628
Goto's phone was not damaged.

324
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:44,128
Which means a different phone was used in the crime.

325
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:46,628
You have that phone on you right now.

326
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:51,428
One with dents that should match those pieces of plastic.

327
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:52,428
Darn it!

328
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:05,028
Komada, why would you do this?

329
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,328
Why?

330
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:10,428
You probably had no idea.

331
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,228
The professor's paper that won the award...

332
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,328
It was originally my thesis.

333
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:19,228
The professor stole my research topic.

334
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,628
What? Is that true?

335
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,828
Naturally, the professor threatened me.

336
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:28,128
He told me to keep my mouth shut

337
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,228
if I wanted to keep doing research at the university.

338
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,728
You should've told someone.

339
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:35,928
I had a dream!

340
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:39,328
Since I was a child, I dreamed of becoming a researcher!

341
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:43,028
But that man...

342
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:45,628
Professor, this isn't what you promised!

343
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,128
Why can't I go to grad school?

344
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,628
Don't worry.

345
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:55,128
I'll help you get a job at some company.

346
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,128
A job?

347
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:58,828
Even if I can't stay here,

348
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,328
can't I at least go to a lab at another university?

349
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,028
Have you forgotten?

350
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,328
I have a lot of influence in this world.

351
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,728
I can change your future with a word.

352
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,828
You were never meant for research.

353
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:16,328
That's all.

354
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,928
It really is a shame.

355
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,428
I ignored my research

356
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:29,028
to repeatedly experiment and perfect this method.

357
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:32,428
I was pretty confident it would work.

358
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,828
But I messed it up in the end.

359
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,728
I guess I wasn't good enough to be researcher after all.

360
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:04,228
If you didn't know where we were going,

361
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:07,528
you should've followed the police.

362
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:10,728
We came this way on the way here.

363
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:15,128
I'm not doing something as pathetic as asking the police for help.

364
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,428
But we're lost now.

365
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:20,428
We even have a GPS! How does this even happen?

366
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:23,528
Because it's giving we weird directions.

367
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,428
Hey, look at that.

368
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:27,728
We made it out.

369
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:31,528
I knew my instincts were right.

370
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:35,528
Huh? Weren't we just here?

371
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:38,928
We won't be getting home for a while...

372
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:45,428
"Next Episode" -I'm hungry.

373
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:46,828
Where are we?

374
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,828
Who are you?

375
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,128
Hello, Inspector Megure?

376
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:57,328
What? You're staking out a counterfeiting operation?

377
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:00,628
It's money!

378
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:03,228
You violated the contract, mister.

379
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:07,028
Why don't you return all the notes you took?

380
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:13,028
