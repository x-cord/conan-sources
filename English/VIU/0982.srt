1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:05,078
The day Ayumi-chan took a badly injured cat to a vet,

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,307
at a restaurant called Bocchan Restaurant,

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:11,988
head receptionist Uranari-san was found murdered.

4
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,878
Judging by the situation,

5
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,007
the culprit was someone working at this restaurant

6
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:21,018
that recreates the world of Natsume Soseki's novel "Bocchan."

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,668
Suspicion initially fell on the manager Red Shirt,

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:31,149
who was involved in a romantic rivalry over the waitress Madonna-san.

9
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:36,578
But we learned waiters Bocchan, Yamaarashi, and Nodaiko

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,099
all had motives for murder and didn't have alibis.

11
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,119
However, the next day, Red Shirt was found hanging from the neck,

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,348
and the police determined that he was the culprit

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,919
and killed himself when he realized he couldn't escape his guilt.

14
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,209
But I won't be fooled.

15
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:59,008
It wasn't Red Shirt who killed Uranari-san,

16
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,109
and Red Shirt's hanging was faked by the true culprit.

17
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:08,159
The search for the truth begins now.

18
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:15,148
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

19
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,098
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

20
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,838
Behind the restaurant murders are relationships that extend beyond the novel!

21
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,408
Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,208
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,549
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:10,569
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant (Part Two)

25
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,809
How do you know that?

26
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:19,689
The night before last, Uranari-san was actually killed here.

27
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,319
Because that cat happened to be here at the same time,

28
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,319
they were harmed by the culprit.

29
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,488
The culprit who stabbed Uranari-san used a car or something

30
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,579
to transport the body to Bocchan Restaurant

31
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,939
in order to convince us that Sanshiro Lake was the crime scene.

32
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,339
So they could frame Red Shirt, who lives at the restaurant.

33
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,669
Yeah. No culprit deliberately makes themselves look suspicious.

34
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,118
You're right.

35
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,679
Which means Red Shirt is innocent.

36
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,559
Then there was no reason for him to kill himself.

37
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,908
Which means...

38
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,939
That suicide was faked by the true culprit as well.

39
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,449
So that Red Shirt would be framed and the investigation would end.

40
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,699
But who among Bocchan, Yamaarashi, and Nodaiko is the culprit?

41
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:19,468
In any case, we should tell Inspector Megure and the old man about our reasoning so far—

42
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:20,589
Conan-kun!

43
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,789
I want us to be the ones who find the culprit who was so cruel to that kitty.

44
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,388
You're right.

45
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,669
Let's find the culprit responsible for that and nail both of them at once.

46
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,959
Indeed.

47
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,929
Yeah.

48
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,178
Let's go talk to those three again.

49
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:36,929
Yeah!

50
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,659
Got it.

51
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,918
The autopsy discovered something strange about Red Shirt's body.

52
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,109
Something strange?

53
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,818
It's about the ladder that was left by his feet.

54
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,858
When a person is hanged using a step of that height,

55
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,789
not much force should be applied to the neck.

56
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:06,808
But there were signs that a rather strong force was applied to the body's neck.

57
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:08,419
What does that mean?

58
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,089
I'm not sure, but it's possible that a third party was involved.

59
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,509
Which means...

60
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,678
I see! Red Shirt's murder was made to look like a suicide,

61
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,429
and the culprit is one of Bocchan, Yamaarashi, or Nodaiko.

62
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,459
What?

63
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,069
They're in the waiting room.

64
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,999
The police and Mori-san are talking to them.

65
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,449
They beat us to it.

66
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,018
So, you don't have alibis for around midnight last night,

67
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,579
which is the time of Red Shirt's death?

68
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,598
What's with the weird phrasing?

69
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,618
You think we did it?

70
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,339
Didn't the boss kill himself?

71
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,818
No. Judging by the strength of the force applied to his neck,

72
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,969
we believe there was a third party involved.

73
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,678
A powerful force was applied to his neck?

74
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:09,679
They didn't just lift the body and hang him by the neck?

75
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,929
Then how did the culprit...?

76
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:19,378
The motive for Red Shirt's murder was revenge for Uranari-san's death.

77
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,789
Revenge?

78
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:26,368
I feel like he's already wrong based on his assumption that Red Shirt killed Uranari-san.

79
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,919
Furthermore, how did he come up with revenge?

80
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,929
You guys know that we hated Uranari.

81
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,339
He yelled at us all the time.

82
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,719
Why would we consider revenge?

83
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:50,678
He's just claiming he hated him and actually enjoyed being yelled at.

84
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:55,069
The culprit had that kind of peculiar side to them.

85
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,319
Are you serious?

86
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,129
Uh, regarding the motive...

87
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:07,459
There's no way we'd kill the boss!

88
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,108
This guy's an ill-natured twisted man,

89
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,219
and this guy's an effeminate crybaby.

90
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,719
And I'm inflexible and stubborn.

91
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,219
There aren't many jobs that we can do.

92
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,448
But the boss hired us one year ago.

93
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,128
He said he was opening a place called Bocchan Restaurant and asked if we wanted to work there.

94
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,399
He recruited us just after looking at us while I was walking around town.

95
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,448
We may have despised Uranari,

96
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:43,779
but we didn't quit because our considerate boss paid us a high salary.

97
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,539
But now that he's dead, this restaurant is done for.

98
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,919
What are we supposed to do?

99
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,418
What kind of idiot would hurt themselves like that?

100
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,919
Exactly.

101
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,069
I-I see...

102
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,498
Those three probably aren't lying.

103
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,598
They didn't kill Red Shirt.

104
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,298
Besides, even if it's possible that they hated Uranari-san enough to kill him,

105
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:18,569
they wouldn't have tried to frame Red Shirt for it.

106
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,949
In other words, those three are innocent of both murders.

107
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:28,949
But that leaves zero people who had motive and no alibi.

108
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,579
Who's the culprit?

109
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,129
Who hated Uranari-san enough to kill him?

110
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,129
And kill Red Shirt in order to frame him?

111
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,639
It could be the opposite.

112
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,009
The opposite?

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,298
It was Red Shirt that the culprit wanted to kill.

114
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:52,458
To do that, it was best to make it look like a suicide,

115
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,528
but they needed a motive for suicide.

116
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,788
So in order to create a false motive,

117
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:01,649
they murdered Uranari-san and directed suspicion towards Red Shirt.

118
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,398
That sounds possible.

119
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,739
But regardless of who their true target was—

120
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,688
If all the waitstaff are innocent,

121
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,588
that means someone else must be the culprit, right?

122
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,148
Maybe this guy hated him.

123
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,969
He's being made to dance even though he's the head chef.

124
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,248
Tanuki...

125
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:28,509
We brought a gift for the little detective crew.

126
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,008
He must've come to spy on us.

127
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,689
Also, you like these, don't you?

128
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,318
I don't like grasshoppers!

129
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,899
You were eating them earlier.

130
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:52,328
By the way, where were you last night and the night before last?

131
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,369
Sleeping at home. What about it?

132
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,869
Nothing.

133
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,058
They're confirming the alibis of everyone involved.

134
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,429
Then no one can verify mine. I live alone.

135
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,198
We were lucky again.

136
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,939
You were at my place last night, right?

137
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,379
You stayed over again?

138
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,429
What is it?!

139
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,909
What's gotten into them?

140
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:37,528
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

141
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,499
Is it Tanuki after all?

142
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,008
What I figured out is how the culprit hanged Red Shirt.

143
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,799
So you didn't find the culprit?

144
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,819
You can't expect things to go that smoothly.

145
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,988
What were you going to say earlier?

146
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:59,059
About regardless of whether it was Uranari-san or Red Shirt?

147
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:05,319
Either way, maybe the culprit used their romantic rivalry against them.

148
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,819
It doesn't sound like there were any other problems between them.

149
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:17,329
Their romantic rivalry started when that lady started working here six months ago, right?

150
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:21,709
I believe she said it was because her younger sister died of an illness.

151
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,728
She wanted to fulfill the desire of her sister who loved the novel "Bocchan,"

152
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,719
and said she wanted to work here.

153
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,599
So she applied for the job instead.

154
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:38,198
The sister passed away from subarachnoid hemorrhaging, right?

155
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,769
Yeah. Is it a rare disease?

156
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,868
No, not really.

157
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,199
But if she was her younger sister, then she must've still been young.

158
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,609
What is it?

159
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,869
I see. If they really wanted to...

160
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,369
You seem to have figured something out.

161
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,299
The question is how to prove it.

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,300
If that's true, that would explain everything.

163
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,329
But we need evidence.

164
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,490
Yeah. Let's split up and investigate.

165
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,780
I'm counting on you guys.

166
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,490
Waiting Room

167
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,276
They don't have it here.

168
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,726
Let's check the next store.

169
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:39,726
Toto General Hospital

170
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:42,187
Outpatient Reception

171
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,357
Hardware Store Manaka

172
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,323
All right.

173
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,062
We've got all the evidence now.

174
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,372
But we're still missing the key piece.

175
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,873
Well, it's just speculation, but that's—

176
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,672
How long are you brats going to stay here?

177
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,212
Mori-kun, can't you give us a break already?

178
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,592
Are you almost there, Mori-san?

179
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,883
Can't you go to sleep soon?

180
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,592
Regarding the motive,

181
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:32,183
ultimately we'll have to get the culprit to admit it.

182
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:37,633
What?

183
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:41,773
You're saying I lied?

184
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:45,153
About Red Shirt and Uranari-san.

185
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,823
Is that true?

186
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:50,972
Did they both harbor romantic feelings for me?

187
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,203
You didn't know?

188
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,332
I thought they were simply pretending

189
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,463
in front of our customers as part of our business strategy.

190
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,522
That was a lie, wasn't it?

191
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:05,823
After all, you pushed them towards becoming romantic rivals.

192
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:08,883
We checked.

193
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,933
With Bocchan, Nodaiko-san, and Yamaarashi-san.

194
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,683
Of course Red Shirt and Uranari had feelings for her.

195
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:22,443
After all, she made both of them think she liked them.

196
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:26,193
It's only natural that they became romantic rivals.

197
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,633
You set it up beforehand, didn't you?

198
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:33,703
In order to frame Red Shirt for Uranari-san's murder.

199
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:39,463
I don't know why you think I did it, but I have an alibi.

200
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,833
Both the night before last when Uranari-san was killed

201
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:47,453
and last night when Red Shirt was hanged, you stayed at Kiyo-san's house.

202
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,192
The night before last you just happened to visit,

203
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:55,552
and last night it was because the murder scared you.

204
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,103
Isn't that what you said?

205
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,292
Because it's true.

206
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:03,233
But even if you stayed over, it was still possible for you to do it.

207
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,272
Both cases happened in the middle of the night.

208
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,252
As long as you slipped out while Kiyo-san was asleep...

209
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,243
Kiyo-san said so herself.

210
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:16,592
Normally I wake up to use the bathroom during the night,

211
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:20,253
but oddly, these past two nights I've slept soundly until morning.

212
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:23,423
As though she'd been drugged with sleeping pills.

213
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,532
You created a fake alibi

214
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,683
and first invited Uranari-san to the park the night before last.

215
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,763
Why did you want to meet in the middle of the night?

216
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,273
I...

217
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:47,933
You stabbed him to death.

218
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:54,943
Then...

219
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:04,212
In order to make it seem like the crime scene was here,

220
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,993
you threw Uranari-san's body into the lake.

221
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:12,913
Ultimately, suspicion fell on Red Shirt, who lives at the restaurant, just as you planned.

222
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,143
You created a motive for Red Shirt's suicide.

223
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:22,893
Last night, you asked Red Shirt to meet you, knocked him out,

224
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,923
and killed him by stringing him up with a rope.

225
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:30,233
Then you made it look like a suicide.

226
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:33,243
Inspector, this was found on the altar in Red Shirt's home!

227
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:37,243
That's probably the weapon used in Uranari's murder.

228
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,592
After killing his romantic rival Uranari,

229
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:44,123
he realized he couldn't escape his guilt, so he took his own life.

230
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:49,532
If you just wanted Red Shirt's death to look like a suicide,

231
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,572
you could have lifted the unconscious Red Shirt

232
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:55,633
and wrapped a rope around his neck.

233
00:16:56,163 --> 00:17:02,143
But you chose that method because you wanted to get revenge with your own hands, didn't you?

234
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,393
The police told us.

235
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,982
Madonna seems plain,

236
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:10,363
but she wrestled as a student.

237
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:14,363
With your strength, you could've done it.

238
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:17,282
But if I lifted a person using the rope,

239
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:20,743
wouldn't there be scrapes on the branch?

240
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:22,993
You used ice, didn't you?

241
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:29,122
For example, ice shaped like a horse saddle.

242
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:31,593
This wouldn't leave any scrape marks behind,

243
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,423
and the ice would melt by morning.

244
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,843
But there were traces left of the ice.

245
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,773
The branch was strangely damp, and Red Shirt's hair was wet, too.

246
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:49,603
There's one more thing that proves your guilt.

247
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,742
You had to make sure the ice wouldn't melt before you used it.

248
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:58,493
You needed a cooler and dry ice.

249
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:02,123
The store employee remembered you buying them.

250
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,623
Since you're so pretty, you must've made an impression.

251
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,962
My alibi isn't ironclad.

252
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:17,513
I am strong, and I did buy a cooler and dry ice.

253
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:22,322
But why would I kill the two of them?

254
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:24,013
I have no motive.

255
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:27,773
Really?

256
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,913
You really have no idea?

257
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:37,533
You told me about your younger sister.

258
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:44,032
Subarachnoid hemorrhaging can appear in young people,

259
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:47,543
but it also happens if you hit your head really hard.

260
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:54,043
I looked into the circumstances of your sister's death.

261
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:04,322
Natsumi was pushed four days ago by two drunk men.

262
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,942
She hit her head then.

263
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,223
I can't think of anything else.

264
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,852
That may be the cause.

265
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,443
Even if the patient seems fine at the time, they sometimes suddenly pass away later.

266
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:21,012
If she'd been seen by a doctor immediately,

267
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:24,452
they may have been able to determine if it caused her symptoms,

268
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,953
but now that it's been several days...

269
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,123
No...

270
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:33,793
Her life was taken, but they'd never be charged.

271
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,593
So you swore revenge, didn't you?

272
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,463
And those two drunk men...

273
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:46,303
You were close with your sister, weren't you?

274
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,683
Very close, right?

275
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:55,593
Yes.

276
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,693
After all, she was my only sister.

277
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:02,763
It was her birthday.

278
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:06,042
The problem is the girl who plays Madonna.

279
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:09,732
Yeah. The current girl does a good job,

280
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,203
but she leaves something to be desired.

281
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:17,083
Natsumi!

282
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,122
Ouch...

283
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:20,832
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,843
Are you all right?

285
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:24,843
I'm totally fine.

286
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,862
Aren't there any suitable girls around?

287
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,853
A Madonna.

288
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,272
I wonder what they mean by Madonna.

289
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:39,113
More importantly, are you sure you're okay?

290
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:42,233
You always make too big a deal out of things.

291
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:49,453
But four days later, Natsumi passed away.

292
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:53,003
It may not have been malicious, but those two killed my sister.

293
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:57,003
So you looked for them.

294
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,312
Madonna.

295
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,872
That word was my only clue,

296
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:06,733
and it led me to Bocchan Restaurant.

297
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:10,643
I got a job, spent six months developing their romantic rivalry,

298
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:13,633
and with these hands...

299
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,903
Though ultimately, you Detective Boys figured it out.

300
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:23,072
But this is for the best.

301
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,783
If I'm not punished, it would be a lie.

302
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:31,682
If I'd forced Natsumi to go the the hospital six months ago,

303
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:34,163
maybe she wouldn't have died.

304
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:47,423
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but we're questioning everyone again.

305
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:51,273
You have something you want to tell them, too, right?

306
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:21,302
After the store closed, those guys...

307
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:23,943
Formed a theater company, right?

308
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:26,522
I'm glad you got better, kitty.

309
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:28,242
Mii-chan!

310
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,153
What?

311
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,493
Mii-chan!

312
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:36,663
Sis, Mii-chan came back!

313
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,433
That's great!

314
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,543
"Fairy Lip."

315
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,423
A pixie's...

316
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,673
Are you with the police?

317
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,113
Lips...

318
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:54,593
He's coming after all!

319
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,603
He can actually read the kanji.

320
00:23:57,993 --> 00:24:00,773
He may have rigged it in some way.

321
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:03,443
Lips...

322
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,093
I see. In that case...

323
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:13,813
The next episode of Conan is "Kid vs. Komei: the Targeted Lips, Part One!"
