1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,580
We arrive at the shooting site of a zombie movie.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,380
That place is rumored to be a place where zombies appear.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,180
Hattori and Kazuha also come to the site to verify the rumor.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,180
On top of that,

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,380
the staff and cast that are involved in the zombie movie sequel arrive too.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,180
However, in the midst of the shooting,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,980
the producer, Mr. Takashi Harawaki, dies.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,880
Since a video of Mr. Harawaki drinking poison

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,480
and a sentence that could be taken as a will were found in his cell phone,

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,980
it was concluded that he had committed suicide but...

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,380
What bothers me more is what was written on the top of the sentence.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,280
Joji Naito.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,480
Who is he anyway?

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,780
He was the president of the horror club

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,480
that we belonged to at the university!

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,380
And at the same time, he was my younger brother.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -The way he died was really strange.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,480
Maybe it influenced Harawaki.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,180
And? How'd he die?

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,980
Why don't we make this movie a mystery movie instead of a horror movie?

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,580
You're the one who suggested we shoot a zombie movie, right?

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,980
It's not that there'll be no zombies.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,480
The twist will be that the real murderer isn't a zombie,

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,680
but a living human!

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,980
"Joji Naito" -If you think it's impossible,

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,980
I'll disappear from this room right now,

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,380
like a corpse that has returned to life as a zombie!

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,780
He told us to wait ten minutes.

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,480
So Ninomiya went outside to stand guard watching the window.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,880
After ten minutes, we re-entered the room,

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,780
"Orie Baisho (29)" -we found that the president had really disappeared!

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,180
He had completely vanished!

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,180
And we thought that maybe he went out through the window

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,280
while Ria and Ninomiya were going over to the window from outside.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,680
So we searched the forest, but he was nowhere in sight.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,580
"Kyoko Ejiri (30)" -Since we were calling the president's name

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
until our throats got parched,

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,880
we wanted to go get a beer.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,380
So we decide to forget the president for now

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,880
and go to town to drink some beer on Harawaki's car!

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,180
Then Ria caught a cold and had to stay in bed for three days.

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,880
And when we returned to the villa on the morning of the fourth day...

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,080
A canvas stained black with crime.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
The chief turns into a zombie.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,780
Those guys close in on the villa of mysteries!

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,780
His name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,979
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 2)"

51
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:27,753
So?

52
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:31,553
How long has it been since your brother died?

53
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:35,453
We were told it's been about half a day.

54
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,553
The only strange thing was that

55
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,253
the fingernails of both my brother's hands

56
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:43,153
seemed as if they had scratched something really hard and come off,

57
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:46,753
but there were no scratch marks anywhere in the room.

58
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,053
Don't tell me that one of you here killed Joji

59
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,953
and moved his body over here?

60
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:56,453
Why would we do something like that?

61
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,253
Before we found the body,

62
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:02,953
we all went to Ria's condo to take care of her.

63
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,653
True.

64
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:09,753
Well, but I had a whole bunch of rare horror DVDs at home,

65
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:11,453
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -so, everybody was drinking and living it up,

66
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:14,353
while saying they were taking care of me though.

67
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:19,753
Well, the only one who could among us was Harawaki.

68
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,653
But he was wasted after drinking for a successive three days.

69
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,253
Wait up!

70
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:25,453
You mean the only one who could drive

71
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:28,053
was Mr. Harawaki who committed suicide?

72
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,253
Yes, that's right.

73
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,453
No good!

74
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:35,353
We can't go call the police then, even if a person died!

75
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,053
What? Why not?

76
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,953
Why not go to the police on the motorbike we came on!

77
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:42,753
I know!

78
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:46,253
But, the gas tank of that motorbike is practically empty!

79
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,753
No!

80
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,353
Didn't you realize that it was empty?

81
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,853
Then, why don't we call the police using our cell phones

82
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,253
and ask them to come?

83
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,053
This place is out of service range.

84
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,053
What?

85
00:05:56,053 --> 00:06:00,653
Then, we'll just have to wait for Ran's Dad to recover.

86
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,053
Yeah.

87
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:06,553
And what happened to that movie?

88
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:09,053
It wasn't completed.

89
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:12,053
The data of that film also went missing.

90
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:15,853
Well, if the whereabouts of the data can be found then,

91
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:19,553
maybe the mystery of Harawaki's suicide can be solved too.

92
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,253
What do you mean by mystery?

93
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,753
Do you know something, Kyoko?

94
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:26,053
I can't tell you yet.

95
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,153
I'll talk about it after the police get here.

96
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:32,153
Because after all, I may be mistaken.

97
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,253
Hey, Ran.

98
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,053
Will you come to the restroom with me?

99
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,353
Okay.

100
00:06:40,353 --> 00:06:45,253
I was thinking of asking you the same thing too, Kazuha.

101
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:49,453
I wish they'd cut out talking about something so horrific.

102
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,253
It really sounds like zombies would appear.

103
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,353
Come on.

104
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,853
Hey, Kazuha.

105
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,653
Is there something behind, us?

106
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,853
No way.

107
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,153
Zombie...

108
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:15,253
Dad?

109
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:18,353
It's your Dad, Ran.

110
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:21,153
Don't scare us, Dad.

111
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:28,153
There are zombies around the house.

112
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:31,553
-Zombies? -Zombies?

113
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:32,853
That's ridiculous.

114
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:37,353
You're probably feverish and thought you saw them?

115
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:40,453
Come on. You're sick so stay in bed, will you?

116
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:51,353
Hey, Pops. Have you recovered yet?

117
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,553
We need you to drive or our hands are tied!

118
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,653
Heiji, he can't. Not yet!

119
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:03,353
He ate poison mushroom, you know?

120
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:07,253
By the way, outside... Look outside.

121
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,053
No! Dad! You can't go outside yet.

122
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:12,653
He's got to stay in bed a while longer.

123
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:16,153
I guess we're going to have to spend the night here.

124
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:17,153
What?

125
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:19,953
We haven't eaten dinner, you know?

126
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,953
I'm starving!

127
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:24,653
I hear there's a convenience store

128
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,253
about a three hour walk down the mountains from here!

129
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:29,253
-Really? -If we ask to use the phone there,

130
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,753
we could probably contact the police as well as call an ambulance.

131
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:34,953
It seems to be a store that they frequented

132
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:37,353
when they came to film movies for their university festival.

133
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:38,853
Really?

134
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,053
But, how interesting that

135
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,853
all the members back then of the horror research club

136
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:46,853
are now the staff of movie.

137
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,153
You heard, haven't you?

138
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:52,053
That back then the younger brother of Directior Naito died?

139
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:55,853
And it seems that that's why the director invited everybody,

140
00:08:55,853 --> 00:09:00,853
suggesting to complete the movie that his brother had been working on!

141
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:04,653
He said that he found the script for the university festival at home.

142
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:08,253
That script that he changed from a horror story to a mystery?

143
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:09,453
No, no.

144
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,953
It seems it was the script that he had upgraded

145
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,053
before turning it into a mystery!

146
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,753
Since the movie turned out to be more of a hit than expected,

147
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,153
the director said that he decided to make a sequel,

148
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:22,853
and thus got everybody together!

149
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:27,553
Although they came here to make a preview of a zombie movie this time,

150
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,253
it actually turned out they are making a trailer

151
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,553
of the sequel of the first movie that will be coming up.

152
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,153
But it's kind of scary going down the mountain

153
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:36,453
to the convenience store, don't you think so?

154
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,053
It feels like zombies may appear.

155
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,153
Don't worry.

156
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,453
Because there are no such things as zombies!

157
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:43,653
Zombies...

158
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,453
There are zombies around the house.

159
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,653
Don't be silly.

160
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,553
Open both eyes of yours and take a good look!

161
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:52,753
There are no...

162
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,353
What the heck are they?

163
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:04,153
What are the group of zombies doing here?

164
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,953
The entire villa is surrounded by them!

165
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:14,253
Kazuha, you take Ran and Pops and go upstairs!

166
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,453
But, Heiji...

167
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:17,953
Don't worry!

168
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:20,853
I won't let even one of them get upstairs!

169
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,953
Okay.

170
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,353
You folks hurry upstairs too!

171
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,653
Darn it! This is all we have!

172
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:36,653
A microphone?

173
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,753
That's right.

174
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,153
I'm sure that in there.

175
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,353
Hey, Hattori!

176
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,753
This is bad! They broke through the window and came in!

177
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,353
Anybody who attacks, I will see as an enemy.

178
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,953
If you wanna die, come take me on!

179
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,571
Dad, get a hold of yourself!

180
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,871
Let's go inside that room.

181
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,871
-No way. -No good!

182
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,271
The corpse is in here!

183
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,271
Darn it. How many of them are there anyway?

184
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,771
Sorry, Kudo.

185
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,671
But, we can't go on like this.

186
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,471
Yeah. I know.

187
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,371
In times like this,

188
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,471
all we have to do is beat the boss to silence the rest.

189
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,171
It's that one!

190
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,771
The brawny big one over there!

191
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,871
I'll bet you're the boss, right?

192
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,671
I killed him!

193
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,271
Kudo, what shall I do?

194
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,071
Look, Hattori!

195
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,671
That's guy's moving despite his head being chopped off!

196
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:41,871
What?

197
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:47,271
I thought they were a band of robbers pretending to be zombies

198
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,471
but if they really are zombies,

199
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:52,871
I guess I've got no choice but to send them all to underworld!

200
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,771
Hold it.

201
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:55,771
What?

202
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:58,371
It's not what we were told.

203
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,971
I got this head fixed and now it's...

204
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:03,071
No good!

205
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:08,871
An audition for extras?

206
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,171
-Yeah. -Yes.

207
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,071
Are you all extras?

208
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,871
Yes. I guess

209
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:14,871
We were told that if we passed,

210
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:17,671
we could act in the sequel of "Zombie Blade".

211
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:21,571
Come to think of it,

212
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,671
I've heard of some guy, who in order to save on movie making budget,

213
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:27,271
had the fans put on make-up for themselves and did an audition.

214
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:29,971
You mean the Halloween Party on the Ship.

215
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,471
It was tough, you know!

216
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,871
We had to put up tents in the forest

217
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,271
and help each other put on make-up.

218
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:40,871
We had to wait while being bitten by mosquitoes and all,

219
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,771
until the time of the audition which started at 8 pm!

220
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,871
I set up my tent for three days!

221
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:50,771
I tried to rehearse my part with a couple who came on pilgrimage,

222
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,371
I was run over by a car and on top of that my head broke off.

223
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:55,371
I spent two days fixing my head, you know?

224
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:56,971
What're you going to do about it?

225
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,771
So, it was him.

226
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:02,371
The zombie who scared the couple.

227
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:06,271
And? Who planned this audition?

228
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,871
The producer, Mr. Harawaki!

229
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,471
The man who committed suicide?

230
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,571
He uploaded on his blog.

231
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,771
It said, "Zombies, come gather because I'll be doing an audition."

232
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:21,871
It was on a secret page that only core fans are aware of.

233
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:24,671
He said not to publicize it

234
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,771
because he wants to surprise the director and staff.

235
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:29,871
Mr. Harawaki was supposed to appear at an appropriate moment

236
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,871
and disclose that it was a surprise.

237
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,571
What's going on anyway?

238
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,271
Hey, Hattori.

239
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:39,771
Would somebody who was planning such a surprise commit suicide?

240
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:40,771
No.

241
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,671
If so, then maybe that suicide actually was...

242
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,671
It seems like some extras broke through the second floor window too.

243
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,571
I tell you, talk about a pain in the butt.

244
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:58,271
Kazuha! They're not zombies.

245
00:14:58,271 --> 00:14:59,771
Heiji...

246
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:02,671
Ms. Kyoko is bleeding from the neck.

247
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:04,171
She won't answer us.

248
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,671
She's not moving at all!

249
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,871
-What? -What?

250
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,271
Kyoko? Get a hold of yourself!

251
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,671
Kyoko?

252
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,371
Move! Don't touch her!

253
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:21,571
No good. She's gone.

254
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,971
Her carotid artery is slashed.

255
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:28,071
Ran, ask the zombies downstairs to get the police.

256
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,971
Zombies?

257
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,271
Because I'm sure some of them came by car.

258
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,971
Okay. Zombies...

259
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:37,371
What was the situation when you found the corpse?

260
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,671
We were all in separate rooms.

261
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:43,671
But, we decided it was safer to stick together.

262
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,571
We were looking for Kyoko and came to this room.

263
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,471
And that's how we found her.

264
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:54,871
Is this cell phone on the chair Kyoko's?

265
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,671
Yes.

266
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:02,171
Just like Mr. Harawaki's, this one's recording too.

267
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,171
What?

268
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:09,971
Don't tell me that the perpetrator is there?

269
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:14,571
The first one to enter the frame is Kyoko.

270
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,271
It seems like she's being chased by someone.

271
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:21,371
Then someone's coming in.

272
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,271
No, stay away!

273
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,871
He bit her neck!

274
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:30,871
It's hard to tell who it is, since his back is turned.

275
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,271
Hey, look this way!

276
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,171
Yeah, that's the way keep going.

277
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,171
What?

278
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,371
No.

279
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,171
Was that Harawaki?

280
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,271
It's impossible!

281
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:46,271
He committed suicide, didn't he?

282
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,471
Heiji?

283
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:48,871
No way!

284
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:52,171
A dead person can never come back to life.

285
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,871
The corpse is gone.

286
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,271
No way! When I can here with Ran a while ago,

287
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,871
it was lying here with a sheet over it.

288
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:06,971
-Really? -Really!

289
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,171
What on earth's...

290
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,871
Going on, anyway?

291
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:20,671
What? The corpse vanished?

292
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:24,371
Yeah. As you can see.

293
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:27,871
The only thing left in the room is the sheet that was over the corpse,

294
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:31,171
the top that Kyoko was wearing before she was killed

295
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:34,671
and the blood stained cutter-knife.

296
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,771
That cutter-knife.

297
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:39,671
I think it was in the tool box.

298
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:42,071
Why is there blood on it?

299
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,071
It's probably the weapon that the perpetrator used

300
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:47,271
to slash Kyoko's neck and kill her.

301
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,471
What?

302
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:51,871
Wasn't Kyoko bitten on the neck?

303
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,971
No!

304
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,271
By the looks of what was taken on the cell phone,

305
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:57,371
it looked like her neck was being bitten off

306
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,771
but she was actually slashed with a knife.

307
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:04,071
It's obvious just by looking at the wound of the carotid artery

308
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:06,671
The question is, who for what and why the perpetrator

309
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:10,171
put Kyoko's cell phone up on the chair that way

310
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,571
and took of video of something like that.

311
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,571
"Masahachi Ninomiya (29)" -Isn't it Harawaki?

312
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,571
Didn't he want to video tape himself

313
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:20,771
after reviving as a zombie and killing Kyoko?

314
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:21,871
Idiot!

315
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:25,471
What makes you think that a dead person can revive so easily?

316
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,871
That video is a trick of some kind!

317
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,371
Trick?

318
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:33,471
Yeah. Talking about trick, there's one more.

319
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,971
Hey, you guys.

320
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:42,471
Did anybody come out of this window or drop something?

321
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,671
What?

322
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,971
We were waiting here from about an hour ago.

323
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:50,271
But nobody opened that window.

324
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,171
Hey, Hattori!

325
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:56,171
There's a window at the dead end of the corridor, right?

326
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,971
-Yeah. -I heard from a zombie

327
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,171
that climbed up to the window and looked into the house,

328
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:06,071
but he doesn't remember who went into which room

329
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:10,171
but there was nobody who carried a corpse out!

330
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,671
It seems that nobody went out this window either.

331
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:19,271
Which means Mr. Harawaki's corpse is...

332
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,871
Yeah.

333
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:25,371
Hidden in somewhere in this room by someone!

334
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:28,671
Okay then, let's all split up and search the room!

335
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:31,771
First, let's start with this wardrobe!

336
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,471
I'll help with the wardrobe too, then.

337
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,671
I guess so.

338
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,271
We've got to move it to find out

339
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:41,571
if there's a hidden door behind it or not.

340
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,771
Will you look under the bed, sonny?

341
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:44,871
Okay!

342
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:47,271
This bed is built-in.

343
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,271
Yeah!

344
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,871
So there might be a hidden aisle or something under it too.

345
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:57,171
What? What's the matter, Orie?

346
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,071
No. It's nothing.

347
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:04,371
Why?

348
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,771
Why isn't the corpse anywhere?

349
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,471
The only thing in the drawer is Harawaki's jacket.

350
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:15,571
There seems to be nothing like a hidden door behind the wardrobe either.

351
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,271
It seems all clear under the bed too.

352
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:21,071
Nothing in the mattress either!

353
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,671
That's impossible.

354
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,371
It's got to be somewhere.

355
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,671
It... It disappeared.

356
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:29,971
Just like the president did eight years ago,

357
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,971
he turned into a zombie and left the room!

358
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,371
Wait...

359
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:43,771
I guess you didn't know

360
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,171
since you and Ninomiya went outside to guard the window,

361
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,271
but eight years ago,

362
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,671
I, along with Harawaki and Kyoko

363
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:52,071
searched every nook and cranny in this room!

364
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:55,371
What? Which means this room is...

365
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,071
Yes, that's right!

366
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,771
The room that the chief vanished from

367
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:02,071
and was found dead four days later.

368
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,671
It was this room!

369
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:07,871
Who was the first to discover the corpse back then?

370
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,771
Kyoko and Ria!

371
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:13,071
Back then they said that they would go search the second floor,

372
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,671
and then a while later we heard Ria scream.

373
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:19,471
So we all rushed over to find Ria on her rear end

374
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:22,771
with Kyoko standing dumbstruck behind her.

375
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:24,471
Does it bug you that I was on my rear end?

376
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:28,271
I mean a person who vanished reappeared before me as a corpse, you know?

377
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,271
Talk of vanishing,

378
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,671
the cart went missing back then too.

379
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:33,971
Cart?

380
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:38,871
Yes. A small cart measuring about 60 x 30 cm

381
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:41,071
that was used for carrying equipment vanished.

382
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,271
Come to think of it,

383
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,471
I lent my younger brother a lot of things

384
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,471
because he said he was going to make a movie

385
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,071
but that's the only thing he didn't return.

386
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:50,371
Somebody said that

387
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:55,671
maybe the cart was used to carry the chief's body to the room.

388
00:21:55,671 --> 00:22:01,071
But that cart was gone from even before the chief disappeared.

389
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,571
Eight years ago, a person suddenly vanishes

390
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:08,371
and reappears as a corpse in the same room.

391
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,071
Then this time the corpse vanishes

392
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:14,971
and a person is killed by that corpse.

393
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,871
As expected...

394
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:22,371
-There is something in this room. -There's something in this room.

395
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,271
"Next Episode" -There's nothing to worry about anymore

396
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:47,871
now that monster hunter Yamamura is here for you.

397
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,271
What're you doing?

398
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,871
The corpse is upstairs.

399
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:53,171
Did you figure out who the perpetrator is too, Conan?

400
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:57,671
No! I'm just helping Heiji out!

401
00:23:57,671 --> 00:24:00,471
But, isn't Harawaki the perpetrator?

402
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,471
Yeah!

403
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:04,971
Because there was a video of him attacking Kyoko, right?

404
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:07,671
The proof is right there on the monitor!

405
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,671
