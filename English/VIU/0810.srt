1
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:11,193
Hold it. Please wait.

2
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:14,493
I apologize. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:17,193
Besides, think about it, will you?

4
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,793
If they find out about this, you won't get away with it.

5
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:22,093
Your life will be over.

6
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:24,894
Those who crave to live, die.

7
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,494
Those who crave to die, live.

8
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,694
I'm Bishamonten.

9
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,993
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

10
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,794
I'm the God of War!

11
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:08,893
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart

12
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:11,093
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

13
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:12,793
The sound of woodpeckers echo through the old battlefield.

14
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:14,793
A case that shakes the police occurs.

15
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,593
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:18,293
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,594
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:06,245
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 1)"

19
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,109
Where is it you want to go?

20
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,609
Since we came all this way to Nagano,

21
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,109
we've to visit the place where Kenshin Uesugi and Shingen Takeda fought,

22
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,609
that is the old Battle of Kawanakajima!

23
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,909
Yes.

24
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,509
But were you that much of a history lover, Dad?

25
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,109
Didn't you know?

26
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,309
Come to think of it.

27
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,509
The other day Yoko Okino played the part of Princess Yu,

28
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,809
who Kansuke Yamamoto, the general of Takeda's army fell in love with

29
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,909
on the history drama special,

30
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,409
Another thing that Nagano's famous for is their Shinshu noodles.

31
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,009
What was the strategy called?

32
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,809
The one that was used to fight that was named after a bird.

33
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,209
Woodpecker.

34
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,909
The woodpecker strategy, Ran!

35
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,409
Officer Yui.

36
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,309
That strategy was called the woodpecker strategy.

37
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,909
A woodpecker pecks on one side of the tree

38
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,309
and lies in wait on the opposite side of the tree

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,209
for the insects to come out.

40
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,909
One part of Takeda's army attacked Uesugi's forces

41
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,609
that had taken up position in the mountains at night.

42
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,809
And the other part, took on the enemy forces

43
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,409
that came rushing down the mountains.

44
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,809
Thus, attacking the enemy from both sides and destroying them.

45
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,909
Besides, it's a famous strategy that is said to have been suggested

46
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,309
by Kansuke Yamamoto to Shingen Takeda!

47
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,909
Right, Kansuke?

48
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,509
Who cares? It's not like I came up with it.

49
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,309
Well, but Kenshin Uesugi expertly saw through this disappointing strategy,

50
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,609
that eventually drove Shingen Takeda into a predicament.

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,909
Like I just said, I didn't come up with it.

52
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,309
What brings all three of you here today?

53
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,509
Is it a case?

54
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,309
No, we were asking around gathering information nearby

55
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,109
so we decided to drop by on our way back.

56
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,609
Besides, Inspector Yamato said he'd never been here before.

57
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,009
Nagano Prefectural Police, Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

58
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,509
One-eyed and big built.

59
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,209
He's got long hair and uses a cane.

60
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,809
The closest person to the description of Rum,

61
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,409
the number two of the Black Organization that Haibara mentioned.

62
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,010
Don't tell me that he's actually...

63
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,009
What is it, kid?

64
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,009
Is there something on my face?

65
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,510
Oh. No.

66
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,110
Hey, Yamato!

67
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,409
What're you doing in a place like this?

68
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,109
"Mamoru Saegusa (37)" -Don't tell me that you're on a date

69
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,509
with your childhood friend, Uehara, on duty?

70
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,809
It... It's nothing like that.

71
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,010
What brings you here, Mr. Saegusa?

72
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,409
We're on our way to the hide-out of a wanted robber,

73
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,709
so we thought we'd pay our respects to Shingen before going.

74
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,209
We didn't come here to waste time.

75
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,909
After all, I'm not Aburakawa.

76
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,609
I'm not Aburakawa!

77
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,009
I'm Akiyama!

78
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,509
"Shinsuke Akiyama (26)" -I told you already, didn't I?

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,309
That my parents divorced last year,

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,209
and I took after my mother's maiden name, Akiyama!

81
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,509
Sorry...

82
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,109
By the way, have you seen our squad chief?

83
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,809
Squad chief? You mean Mr. Takeda?

84
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,810
"Shoji Kano (45)" -Yeah.

85
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:15,309
We were supposed to join here.

86
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,209
But, he's nowhere in sight.

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,209
His cell phone won't connect either.

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,609
Darn, I wonder where and what he's doing?

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,609
Maybe he's waiting at the wrong place?

90
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,709
After all, that man's pretty aged already.

91
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,909
Could be.

92
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,509
Let's go look elsewhere then.

93
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,109
Sorry to have intruded on you.

94
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,109
Oh, and if you see Takeda, tell him this.

95
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,409
That even though it's orders from the higher up,

96
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,509
I'll never go back to your squad.

97
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,810
I'd rather die than go back there!

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,209
Yeah, I'll tell him.

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,509
I think you're the perfect fit for our squad.

100
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,910
Too bad.

101
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,309
Did something happen between that officer named Takeda?

102
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,209
Yeah, just a little something in the past.

103
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,509
If you're going to the Battle of Kawanakajima,

104
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,909
would you like me to show you around?

105
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,809
You mean it's okay?

106
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,309
I guess so.

107
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,309
Since we still have some time before the investigation conference.

108
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,809
Even if we were go back to headquarters now,

109
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,709
all we have waiting there is for you to serve us your awful coffee.

110
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,909
How rude!

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,809
The chief said that my coffee's starting to taste better!

112
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,409
That was the previous chief of section one.

113
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,109
The current chief prefers black tea.

114
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,709
That man prefers tea with his looks?

115
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,909
You're not one to criticize other people's looks yourself, are you?

116
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,609
Let's hurry and go around.

117
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,309
"Kansuke Shrine" -First of all, this is the place

118
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,609
that Kansuke Yamamoto is said to have died,

119
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,609
The Kansuke Shrine.

120
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,209
"Yamamoto Grave" -And this is Kansuke's grave.

121
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,009
"Doai Bridge" -And this is the Doai Bridge

122
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,509
where Kansuke's head and body matched up perfectly.

123
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,809
-Matched up perfectly? -Matched up perfectly?

124
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,810
Right.

125
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:57,009
Kansuke's men managed to get back several of the heads

126
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,409
of the allied generals that were taken in battle by their enemy,

127
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,709
but since they were all smeared with blood,

128
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,409
they couldn't tell which head was Kansuke's.

129
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,909
But when one of the heads matched up perfectly

130
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,409
with Kansuke's still armored body that was left back at the battlefield,

131
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,709
they knew it was Kansuke's head.

132
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,509
And it happened on this bridge.

133
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,909
Oh.

134
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,409
But...

135
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,409
This is more like a tour visiting

136
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,709
the famous places involving Kansuke Yamamoto than the battlefield, right?

137
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,509
Oh, well, this is...

138
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,509
It can't be helped.

139
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,209
After all having a childhood friend

140
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,909
with a super similar name like Kansuke Yamato,

141
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,009
it's only natural that she'd be interested in this place.

142
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,309
But despite their similarities,

143
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,309
I hope he doesn't do anything like die recklessly over a failed strategy

144
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,709
like the real Kansuke Yamamoto.

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,009
Well, you don't look to be sensitive enough to regret failure though.

146
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,809
What?

147
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,909
Come... Both of you.

148
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,209
It's almost about time

149
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,709
so let's go take a look at the Chikuma River

150
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,709
and finish the tour of the battlefield.

151
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,710
Okay.

152
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,909
What beautiful scenery!

153
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,209
And, the river's so clear too!

154
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,409
It's hard to believe that a battle took place here in the past.

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,310
Come to think of it, I think there was a poem about the river.

156
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,009
"The bones of the dead lying in the water"

157
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,710
"conjures images of warriors in the waters of the red river."

158
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,809
Water of the red river?

159
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,809
Just what does it mean?

160
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,709
I'm not sure if it's about Chikuma River here

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,909
but over thousands of men are said to have died

162
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,409
in the fierce Battle of Kawanakajima.

163
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,809
And Retsu Asai wrote this poem based on the legend.

164
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,909
That the river that flows in front of the shrine,

165
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,709
turned red with the blood of the fallen warriors

166
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,310
for three days and nights to put their souls to rest.

167
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,609
Since that battle, the river has been known as Akagawa, The Red River,

168
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,509
and the shrine, Akagawa Shrine, The Red River Shrine.

169
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,709
It's all exaggeration.

170
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,710
There's no way a river could turn red for three days and three nights.

171
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,310
Blood?

172
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,310
That's...

173
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,009
A person's head?

174
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,909
Call forensics right away!

175
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,010
Yes!

176
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,109
Hey! Was it really somebody's head?

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,409
Yeah.

178
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,809
Moreover, it's the head of someone I know.

179
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,509
He's from the Nagano Prefectural Police First Investigation Section.

180
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,909
Inspector and Squad Chief, Shigeru Takeda.

181
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,109
But...

182
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,409
Where's his body?

183
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,209
Over here it seems.

184
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,409
Unfortunately, on top of it having been burned,

185
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,309
it seems to have been slightly damaged too.

186
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,409
So, we won't be able to put them together

187
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,810
like Kansuke Yamamoto's was though.

188
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,509
Chief Takeda?

189
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,409
Who on earth?

190
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,609
Why?

191
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,509
Judging from the looks of it,

192
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,709
it was burned over half a day ago.

193
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,709
So, why did just the head come drifting along

194
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,609
just when I looked into the river from the bridge?

195
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,309
Maybe it's because the head was hung to the railing of the bridge?

196
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,710
See, over there!

197
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,109
There's something that looks like a string hanging down.

198
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,809
The perpetrator probably put the head and fake blood into a plastic bag

199
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,609
and set it up so the string would break

200
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,809
and the bag would fall into the river after a certain amount of time.

201
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,209
A stone or something was probably put in the bag

202
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,809
so only the bag would sink.

203
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,409
We heard a splashing sound

204
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,809
so I think there's no mistake about it!

205
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,609
Right, Pops Kogoro?

206
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,009
Yeah.

207
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,909
But how do you know it's fake blood?

208
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,309
Real blood would have congealed after a while

209
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,009
and wouldn't have come flowing in the river.

210
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,809
But why go through the trouble of using fake blood?

211
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,409
Probably to facilitate it being found.

212
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,009
I happen to spot it because I was looking at the river,

213
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,409
but otherwise it would have looked like trash drifting down the river.

214
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,309
There was an unnatural blood stain on the forehead

215
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,409
so we put luminol fluid on it and found a strange mark.

216
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,710
What?

217
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,209
Isn't this the alphabet X?

218
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,609
No, it's not an ordinary X.

219
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,809
It looks to be the footprint of an animal.

220
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,110
A woodpecker.

221
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,809
Woodpeckers have feet that cling tightly to trees.

222
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,809
That's why their claws are shaped like an X.

223
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,710
Didn't you know?

224
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,810
A... A one-eyed man of big built?

225
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,869
But...

226
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,869
Takeda was sure hated, wasn't he?

227
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,269
Well, we can't be sure if this body is really Takeda's or not though.

228
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,469
Oh, well as to that, there's no mistake about it.

229
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,169
From the tip of his shoe that barely survived the fire,

230
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,469
we found his right big toe.

231
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,569
We should be able to do a DNA comparison.

232
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,869
I see. Then do it right away.

233
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,169
"Hyoe Kuroda (50)" -Come to think of it,

234
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,269
wasn't the Takeda Squad supposed to take an arrest warrant over

235
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,769
to the hide-out of the wanted robber?

236
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,669
But, we couldn't get in touch with him at all this morning.

237
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,670
And he didn't show up at the Hachiman Shrine

238
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,069
where we were supposed to meet him either.

239
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,869
Having no choice, we raided the robber's hide-out just the three of us,

240
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,369
but it seems he sensed us coming and the hide-out was empty.

241
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,469
After that, we split up and searched for Squad Chief Takeda.

242
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,669
Then we got word that a corpse was found.

243
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,569
Don't tell me that the squad chief went to the hide-out of that robber

244
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,969
before us and confronted him.

245
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,669
And was counterattacked.

246
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,869
Not old man Takeda, he would never do that.

247
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,869
He would willingly kill to arrest.

248
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,169
But, what bothers me is the mark of the woodpecker.

249
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,769
We've got to figure out what it means.

250
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,669
Maybe the perpetrator used the woodpecker

251
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,269
just to leave an X mark on the forehead?

252
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,169
It does look like a kill mark too.

253
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,069
Your deduction lacks finesse as usual.

254
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,069
Doesn't the connection between Takeda and a woodpecker

255
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,369
ring a bell in anybody?

256
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,269
-No. -Nothing in particular.

257
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,970
The Woodpeckers Club.

258
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,569
Just around the time, I married into the Torada family.

259
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,169
My late husband said.

260
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,769
That there seems to be a group called The Woodpeckers Club

261
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,669
at the Nagano Prefectural Police.

262
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,269
I've never heard of it,

263
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,369
but what kind of group is it?

264
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,369
Well... When I mentioned that I used to be a police detective,

265
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,469
he clammed up.

266
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,469
He didn't have nice things to say about it, though. That's for sure.

267
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,769
I see.

268
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,869
At any rate, if the body was burned under this bridge,

269
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,169
somebody may have witnessed fire or smoke.

270
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,969
Saegusa, Kano and Akiyama, go ask around this vicinity!

271
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,169
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

272
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,669
Yamato, Morofushi and Uehara,

273
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,269
go search for anyone that may had a grudge because of a case or something.

274
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,569
All right.

275
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,869
Be on your guard.

276
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,769
If as Yamato says, the woodpecker's footprint is a kill mark,

277
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,669
the suspect could be planning to come after us, the police force, next.

278
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,669
Detective Mouri.

279
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,669
I've heard about you.

280
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,469
I don't want to do this to you,

281
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,469
but I'm going to have you go around with Uehara and the others

282
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,469
because you're one of the first discoverers.

283
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,769
Yes, sir!

284
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,369
Of course!

285
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,169
Officer Yui.

286
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,369
What is it, Conan?

287
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,570
I've something I'd like to ask you later.

288
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,370
"Nagano Prefectural Police Headquarters" -What?

289
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:01,469
He was unconscious for nearly 10 years in the hospital?

290
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,369
At the police hospital?

291
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,369
Investigation first Section Chief Kuroda

292
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,169
seems to have gotten into a terribly serious accident.

293
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,469
I see, that's why he was temporarily transferred at that age and came.

294
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,369
Yes. It's more natural to transfer from the National Police Agency

295
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,369
to the local police at a younger age.

296
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,669
Then, the burn that he had on his face was...

297
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,769
I think it was because of that accident.

298
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,869
His right eye seems to be artificial

299
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,069
and the nurse who undid his bandaged seemed to have gone weak in the hips.

300
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,369
His pitch black hair seems to have turned totally white

301
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,469
because of stress of the accident

302
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,669
and he seemed like a completely different person.

303
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,369
A different person?

304
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,169
Even now after he regained consciousness,

305
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,869
he says that he can't keep track of details here and there.

306
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,369
What is it, Conan?

307
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,069
Is something bothering you about the chief?

308
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,269
Oh, no.

309
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,869
Well, it's only natural that you'd be bothered.

310
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,569
Because he does look like some big shot of a certain organization.

311
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,069
Well, your face is a good match with his though.

312
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,069
I wished you'd shut up!

313
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,169
And? Did you find anything?

314
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,269
Yes.

315
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,869
I took a look at the cases Mr. Takeda handled

316
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,269
using the computer in the reference room.

317
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,769
And there were two cases that caught my eye,

318
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,669
in which Mr. Takeda shot and killed the suspect.

319
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,869
Shot and killed?

320
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,870
Yeah. The first was nine years ago.

321
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,669
A man used drugs and randomly fired his gun in town.

322
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,269
The second was six months ago when a man took people hostage

323
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,069
and confined himself in a bank.

324
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,969
Both of them were shot in the head with old man Takeda's gun and died.

325
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,269
And both of them were submitted to the prosecution with dead suspects.

326
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,769
Then you mean that the bereaved family of the two

327
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,569
held a grudge against him and...

328
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,369
I thought so at first

329
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,169
but the parents of the one who confined himself to the bank

330
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,669
regretted what their son had done and committed suicide.

331
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,069
He had no siblings either.

332
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,169
The parents of the man who randomly shot his gun

333
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,869
have also died of an illness.

334
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,569
The only person left is the grandmother of the suspect who's over 80.

335
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,769
But that old lady couldn't have done something like that.

336
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,469
Come to think of it, haven't you seen anything, Kansuke?

337
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,869
Like a suspicious smoke or a person.

338
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,869
I thought you used that bridge for rehabilitation of your legs.

339
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,569
Yeah. I had some things to attend to and didn't go today.

340
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,869
Oh, sorry. I've got something to attend to again.

341
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,169
If there's any progress, mail me, won't you?

342
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,269
Kansuke?

343
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,069
Inspector Yamato mentioned "that old lady" a while ago,

344
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,369
does he know the grandmother of the perpetrator?

345
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,370
Yes.

346
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:37,669
The man who shot the gun randomly in town nine years ago was in fact...

347
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,669
Inspector Yamato's childhood friend.

348
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,569
I remember that he and Kansuke used to play a lot together

349
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,069
until sundown when they were children.

350
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,769
To the point of making me a bit jealous.

351
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,469
You were jealous?

352
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,769
Oh, don't tell Kansuke this.

353
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,770
I won't.

354
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,969
I see, that's why he said what he did at the shrine.

355
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,869
I'll never go back to your squad.

356
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,269
I'd rather die than go back there!

357
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,869
Because his best friend was shot to death by that officer named Takeda.

358
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,069
Right.

359
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,869
Moreover, right before his eyes.

360
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,669
Back then Kansuke was at the crime site as a member of the Takeda Squad.

361
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,569
Since there were casualties in that shooting,

362
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,770
he said that Takeda had no choice but to shoot the suspect.

363
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,070
Where is it? Where is it?

364
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,369
The investigation documents of the case.

365
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,969
If I remember correctly...

366
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,170
Found it. This is it.

367
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,370
"Death by gunshot wound to the head".

368
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,570
I see. That's the story.

369
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,170
I've to hurry and let him know about this too.

370
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,269
Hey, where's Yamato?

371
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,669
Where the heck did he go?

372
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,769
Did something come up?

373
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,969
Saegusa and his group came up with something when they were asking around.

374
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,569
They found a witness who testified seeing somebody who looked like Yamato

375
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,469
near the crime site this morning!

376
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,369
What? But Kansuke...

377
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,869
I mean... Inspector Yamato said that he didn't go there this morning.

378
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,069
Either way, we've got to talk to him.

379
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,069
"Kansuke Yamato" -It's from Kansuke.

380
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,869
-Kansuke. -Is Mr. Kano there?

381
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,369
He's asking if Mr. Kano is here.

382
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,669
Mr. Kano said that he realized something,

383
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,269
so he was going back home.

384
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,969
He has copies of the cases handled stored at his house, you see.

385
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,369
It seems he went home.

386
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,369
What about Mr. Kano?

387
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,869
I had about 10 somewhat missed calls from him!

388
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,369
I called him back but he isn't answering.

389
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,469
I'm sure something happened to him.

390
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,369
I'm going to head on over there, so you guys hurry up and come too!

391
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,969
Hey, wait.

392
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,369
What's up?

393
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,269
He says that he's anxious

394
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,969
about the number of missed calls he received from Mr. Kano

395
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,169
and is going directly over to his house.

396
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,669
I see. Then, let's head on to Kano's house too!

397
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,770
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

398
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,369
Morofushi.

399
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,069
Yes, sir!

400
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,369
Keep your eyes on Yamato from now on.

401
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,969
Today is the day that the random shooting occurred nine years ago.

402
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,669
It's the memorial day of his best friend.

403
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,069
You know what I mean, don't you?

404
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,569
Yes.

405
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,770
The lock is open.

406
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,470
Kansuke's shoes.

407
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,569
Hey, where are you?

408
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,770
Mr. Kano!

409
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,670
I'm Bishamonten.

410
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,469
Oh, Kansuke.

411
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,069
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

412
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm the God of War!

413
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,569
"Next Episode" -There are...

414
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,369
three woodpecker's left.

415
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,769
Komei. Don't tell me that you...

416
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,869
Right, Kansuke.

417
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,569
It's you.

418
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,369
You find the clue to solving the case

419
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,869
from an unexpected perspective and support the deduction.

420
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,869
The wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

421
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,770
It's rumored to be so at MPD, Conan Edogawa.

422
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,770
Next Conan, "The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 2)"
