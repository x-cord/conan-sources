1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,707
We encountered a strange boy

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:07,007
who kept looking at an apartment.

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:11,807
He tells us that a "kind lady" had been killed.

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:17,407
At the apartment, we discovered the body of the lady

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,108
whose death may have been made to look like a suicide.

6
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:22,408
Just then...

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,307
What's the matter?

8
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:29,207
They... they're there.

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,507
The ones who were in her room a while ago.

10
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,108
The... the three!

11
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:41,807
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

12
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,807
Love and cases come from the same origin.

13
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:45,407
The case of the discoverers who didn't report to the police

14
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:47,507
because of the money involved, ends in a most unexpected way!

15
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,107
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,007
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,508
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:38,500
"The Three First Discoverers (Part 2)"

19
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,631
And, what are we going to do?

20
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:45,031
We can't join the interrogation, you know.

21
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,131
Well, that's obvious.

22
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,531
Don't worry!

23
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,331
I stuck the Detective Squad badge

24
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:53,132
in Officer Takagi's pocket a while ago.

25
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,831
Just as I thought.

26
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,831
So, you're the one who stole the 500,000 yen from this room?

27
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,831
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:06,531
And? Where was the money?

29
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:08,032
Around there!

30
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:11,931
Under the feet of her hanging corpse.

31
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,631
"Ronpei Sakaba (31)" -It was rolling here and...

32
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,131
"Ronpei Sakaba (31)" -No, I mean...

33
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,432
Scattered everywhere.

34
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,331
Didn't you actually steal it along with her cell phone

35
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,831
after you killed the victim?

36
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,031
Cell phone?

37
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:30,131
The charger's here but the phone's not!

38
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:35,031
Inspector. Maybe Ms. Komai used the bills as a footstool.

39
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:38,231
I don't think 500,000 yen's enough.

40
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:43,531
But, 10 million would be about 10cm high, I suppose.

41
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:44,832
Indeed.

42
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:47,531
Next!

43
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,031
Go inside big man!

44
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,931
The victim weighed 47kg.

45
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,531
If the perp lifted her body and hung her...

46
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,832
"Kuramichi Habanaka (40)" -He'd be the prime suspect.

47
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,532
There's tape on the sole of his sandal?

48
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,531
So, I just told you a while ago, didn't I?

49
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:16,331
I just took the manuscript that was left at the entrance with me.

50
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:19,131
Are you sure it was the entrance?

51
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,132
The forensic officer said

52
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,331
there were three different types of shoe prints.

53
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:25,931
Oh, well. Actually...

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:31,731
The manuscripts were in a bag at her feet

55
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,831
and although I felt bad about doing so,

56
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:37,131
I went into the room with my shoes on to pick it up.

57
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,231
Under her feet again.

58
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:43,431
But, how unusual in this day and age. Manuscripts?

59
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,331
Yes. And because of this,

60
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,831
all the errors and corrections make it hard to read.

61
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:52,731
Therefore, I read the manuscripts after the AD that I give them to,

62
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,831
types them up on the computer.

63
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:58,231
By the way, how many pages was the manuscript?

64
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:02,331
It was a two-hour special, so maybe about 100 pages.

65
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:05,531
They weren't folded or rolled up, were they?

66
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,632
No.

67
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:11,331
A hundred pages of standard paper would be about 1cm tall.

68
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,631
It's not enough for her to stand on, either.

69
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:19,132
But, why didn't you call the police right away?

70
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,731
Please... please keep this off the records.

71
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:28,931
She was actually a ghost writer for a famous scriptwriter.

72
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,631
So, I thought it would cause problems

73
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:34,531
if the scripts were made public because of the case.

74
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,231
I see.

75
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:40,031
To tell the truth, I wanted her to work independently.

76
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:42,231
But, the scriptwriter

77
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:47,331
was in love with her realistic and vivid crime schemes she wrote.

78
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,531
By the way, what's the title?

79
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,831
The Moonless Night Thieves series.

80
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:54,431
Oh. I know it.

81
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,331
They use impressive means

82
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,931
to steal gracefully from evil, wealth individuals!

83
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:03,831
Oh, but in the final episode, they killed the couple they robbed,

84
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:06,031
and the group disbanded.

85
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,831
Yes. That part really affected me too.

86
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:11,031
Affected you?

87
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:12,931
Oh, well, but...

88
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:19,631
In this script, the thieves were supposed to get back together again!

89
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:24,231
The couple they thought they killed was alive, you see.

90
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,332
Is... is that so?

91
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:32,732
But I never thought it would become her posthumous work.

92
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,331
We fought.

93
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,931
A couple of days ago at the pub.

94
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,931
You mean, with the victim Ms. Komai?

95
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,831
The truth is, I came here because she told me that

96
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:48,631
she wanted to apologize.

97
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,831
"Denji Shibakaru (63)" -The owner and customers at the pub

98
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:54,231
were also watching the fight,

99
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:55,831
so I didn't think you'd believe me

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,931
if I told you that I found her hanging and already dead

101
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,831
when I got here.

102
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:05,031
So, that's why you left without calling the police?

103
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,131
Yeah.

104
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,431
But, I didn't think that the boy

105
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:12,131
was watching us going in and out of this room.

106
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,731
By the way, what caused the fight?

107
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:17,531
Phooey, it was a stupid argument.

108
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:21,431
We just got a little loud because we were both drinking!

109
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,731
Hey! Hurry up and answer the phone!

110
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:26,931
It's been ringing for some time!

111
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:31,331
Oh, but it's not our ringtone.

112
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,031
Oh, it's my cell phone!

113
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:38,132
I forgot that I changed the ringtone the other day.

114
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,931
Are you hanging up without answering?

115
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:45,832
It's an invitation from a bar hostess.

116
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,031
Did you come up with anything?

117
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:53,431
Yeah. The one who caused this incident,

118
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:57,931
and that the name of the boy is Mamoru Ganno.

119
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,331
How did you find out?

120
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:01,431
Three years ago,

121
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,931
a band of robbers broke into the house of a certain family.

122
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,731
The husband and wife were killed,

123
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,231
and robbed of two million yen in cash.

124
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:13,331
He's the only son of that couple.

125
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:16,331
I saw pictures of them on the net, face and all.

126
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:20,031
It said he happened to be on excursion and escaped unscathed.

127
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,231
It was also written that ever since that incident,

128
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,031
the band of thieves has also been missing.

129
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,831
As to the two million yen,

130
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:31,131
the numbers of the bills were coincidentally jotted down.

131
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:33,031
It's finally over.

132
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,131
Then, we get to go, don't we?

133
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,831
I've got to get back to the TV station too.

134
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,231
Well...

135
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,332
Officer Takagi.

136
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,731
I think you should search the room more thoroughly.

137
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:46,732
What?

138
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,031
The 500,000 yen is definitely in there somewhere.

139
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:51,032
What?

140
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,232
And...

141
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,331
Could you lend me 20,000 yen?

142
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,432
What?

143
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,713
At any rate, according to the testimony of the eye-witness,

144
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,413
after the three of you came in and out of this room,

145
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,613
one after the other,

146
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,913
the eye-witness came here and found,

147
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:17,613
scriptwriter Ms. Yasue Komai hung to death.

148
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:21,713
Judging from the fact that there was no footstool at her feet,

149
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,013
it's only thinkable that she was killed,

150
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:26,813
then made to look as if she committed suicide.

151
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:30,513
By one of you three!

152
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:33,813
Like I've been saying!

153
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:38,613
When I came to this room, she was already hanging there dead.

154
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:42,113
I did take the money that was on the floor though,

155
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,013
but I didn't kill her!

156
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:50,213
Me too. All I did was take the manuscripts that were at her feet.

157
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,313
I didn't do anything I have to feel guilty about.

158
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:56,013
Same here. When I entered the room,

159
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:59,113
I saw her hanging from the ceiling,

160
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:03,114
but I didn't take anything from the room.

161
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:05,713
Then can you at least

162
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,013
tell me around what time you came to this room?

163
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:12,813
I wonder. I was just told to come around after 2pm

164
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:15,913
so I don't remember the exact time.

165
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,513
I think I came around 2pm too.

166
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:21,013
When I called her from the phone booth,

167
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,813
that's the time she told me to come.

168
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:26,713
I came on my own, so I didn't have an appointment.

169
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:29,813
Which means all three of you came around after 2pm,

170
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,913
but none of you ran into each other?

171
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,113
It was just a coincidence.

172
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:38,414
There are such coincidences, right?

173
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,213
Maybe they're matching their stories?

174
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,313
Maybe they all agreed to keep the time,

175
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:47,313
Ms. Komai told them to come over a secret!

176
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,113
Because those three seem to know each other.

177
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,513
They know each other?

178
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:55,913
Remember? When that old man lit his lighter,

179
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,213
although there was wind blowing,

180
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:00,813
a large flame was lit without swaying.

181
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:04,213
That's because the big man was near the old man

182
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,513
and blocking the wind, right?

183
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,613
Oh. Well...

184
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,813
But, that man was choking and coughing at the cigarette smoke.

185
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:14,513
Maybe he doesn't like cigarettes?

186
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,913
If so, why'd he do such a thing?

187
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:22,013
That goes to show that the old man means a lot to him!

188
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,413
I see.

189
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:27,513
That's why he went over to block the wind, correct?

190
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:30,813
Since he was outside, as long as he didn't get too close,

191
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,213
the smoke wouldn't bother him.

192
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:38,013
And when the long-haired man borrowed the lighter,

193
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,613
he adjusted the flames to become smaller, right?

194
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,113
So what?

195
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,313
How did you know before you lighted the lighter,

196
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:51,013
that the old man always set the flames at max?

197
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:54,113
Oh, well, that's...

198
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:58,113
Besides, when the other man was smoking,

199
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:02,813
the big man went up to him and glared, right?

200
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:06,314
As if saying I'm not going to let you smoke!

201
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:10,113
The long-haired man panicked,

202
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,413
and snuffed out his cigarette that he wasn't finished smoking yet.

203
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:16,613
I'm positive that these three know each other!

204
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:19,613
So what if we know each other?

205
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,013
Like I was just saying.

206
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,313
You all matched your stories

207
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:27,114
and lied about the time that you came to the room.

208
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,013
Because, if all of you

209
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:34,013
insist that the lady was dead when you came to the room,

210
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,513
the first one who came

211
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,113
had to be the one that killed and hung her,

212
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,613
but it would mean that you're all lying!

213
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,313
True.

214
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:47,413
That's why you took the lady's cell phone, old man, right?

215
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,713
Because you didn't want people to know the order in which you came.

216
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:51,913
What?

217
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:56,813
I think the lady mailed all of you to come over.

218
00:12:56,814 --> 00:13:00,813
Rather than verbally, that way she could mail you by the minute.

219
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,713
And because of this, you didn't run into each other

220
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,513
although you came at around the same time!

221
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:09,713
But how do you know he took her phone?

222
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,713
Well, the old man didn't know

223
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:16,113
the ringtone of the cell phone he had, right?

224
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:19,013
He didn't answer the phone either.

225
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,913
That was because it was the lady's cell phone!

226
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:25,113
So, the picture in the cell phone that you showed me

227
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:28,013
was actually the lady's, right?

228
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,713
But, why do you know about the ringtone?

229
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:33,113
I... I heard it through the wall.

230
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,113
I have good ears, you see!

231
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,113
I've got to retrieve the Detective Squad badge

232
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,014
that I stuck in Officer Takagi later.

233
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:46,913
Then, Mr. Shibakaru, I'd like to check the cell phone that you have.

234
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:50,113
No, this is really mine.

235
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:53,513
But, the order in which the three came,

236
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:57,813
that can be figured out by that cell phone is meaningless!

237
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:00,014
Meaningless?

238
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:05,913
Oh, Officer Takagi! Did you buy it?

239
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,313
Yeah.

240
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,713
I bought the notebook and the tape,

241
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:12,213
and changed 20,000 yen in thousand yen notes.

242
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:14,913
Just what're you using them for?

243
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,613
I'm going to do an experiment now, but may I use the room?

244
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,613
Yeah.

245
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:24,013
Then, help me out too, you guys!

246
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:27,014
It's like art craft class!

247
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:33,113
Okay! It's done, Conan!

248
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:36,013
Oh! Thank you, please leave it there!

249
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,014
Okay!

250
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,913
Is this really something

251
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,113
that has to do with the investigation of the case?

252
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,413
Probably.

253
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,013
Is this good enough?

254
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,813
Yes, very good.

255
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:49,114
Okay! All done!

256
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,313
Now, we're all set!

257
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,513
What's okay?

258
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:58,813
All you did was roll 20 thousand yen bills up by tape into cylinders

259
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,113
and lined them out!

260
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:05,914
But, I'm sure the long-haired man had seen these cylinders before, no?

261
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:10,013
Because you sort of said that you found money

262
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:14,413
rolling at the feet of the lady that hung herself.

263
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,313
It's true if they were scattered on the floor,

264
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,313
you'd say they were rolling, but...

265
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,213
Is that how it was?

266
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,613
Yeah. I guess so.

267
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:25,613
And? What about the experiment?

268
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:30,213
Put the notebook on the cylinders that are lined up.

269
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,314
And get on very carefully.

270
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:36,513
See! You can stand on it.

271
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,114
Wow!

272
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:41,713
But, why?

273
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,913
I weigh 18kg!

274
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:47,913
One cylinder can hold up to 1kg.

275
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,513
I get it!

276
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:52,513
Ms. Komai used this as a footstool!

277
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:56,013
She weighed about 47kg.

278
00:15:56,014 --> 00:16:00,213
If she lined up cylinders amounting to 500,000 yen vertically,

279
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:04,313
and place the envelope with the 100 paged manuscript inside it,

280
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:08,313
a footstool enough to support her weight can be constructed!

281
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,613
I see.

282
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:13,613
After she kicked the footstool and hung herself,

283
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:16,613
Mr. Sakaba stole the cylinders amounting to 500,000 yen

284
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,913
that were scattered on the floor.

285
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,413
If Mr. Habanaka picks up

286
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,713
the envelope with the manuscript inside from the floor,

287
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:27,713
the footstool would be gone and it would look like homicide.

288
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:31,313
And if Mr. Shibakaru is made to take the cell phone away,

289
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:35,513
then nobody would know the three were asked to come by the minute.

290
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:37,413
If an eye-witness is set up

291
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,713
to watch the three go in and out of the room,

292
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:44,413
all of you would turn up as suspects of murder.

293
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:45,513
Oh.

294
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,013
So, she committed suicide after all.

295
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:49,613
What a scare.

296
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:52,913
But, there's no proof of that yet.

297
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,913
The evidence is on the sole of the sandal

298
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,013
that the long-haired man is wearing.

299
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,213
-What? -The tape that the lady used

300
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:03,113
when she rolled the bills up into cylinders.

301
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,913
No, joke?

302
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:06,313
True.

303
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:09,813
You were taking the tapes of bill worth 500,000 yen off,

304
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,713
so that's what took you long

305
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:14,613
to return to the ATM of the bank from here, right?

306
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,613
Yeah.

307
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:20,413
I think the lady's fingerprints should be on the tape.

308
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,413
And traces of the tape should also be on the 500,000 yen

309
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,813
that you deposited in the ATM.

310
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:30,413
Go right away to that bank where the ATM is and confirm!

311
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:31,614
Yes, sir!

312
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:36,313
But, how amazing Conan!

313
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,413
It's as if you're Shinichi!

314
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:43,513
Oh... I discussed that deduction over with Shinichi by mail

315
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:47,013
and just read off what he wrote back.

316
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:50,313
Oh. I thought so.

317
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,913
Which means we're all innocent.

318
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,813
We get to go, right?

319
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,413
I've still got work to do.

320
00:17:56,414 --> 00:18:01,513
Oh, I still have to ask you why she did what she did.

321
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,013
Oh, that's right! I'll return this cell phone.

322
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:08,413
I took it with me because I didn't want to be suspected.

323
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:10,714
Give me a break, will you?

324
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,913
Well, I don't know why she committed suicide

325
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,613
while trying to set us up like we murdered her,

326
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:20,113
but in my case I guess it was the argument I had with her at the pub.

327
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:21,213
In my case, it was probably because

328
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:24,813
I asked her to suddenly give me back the money I lent her.

329
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:28,113
I guess the fact that she couldn't go independent for some time now,

330
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,413
was one reason that stressed her out too.

331
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,513
See you.

332
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,613
Oh, hey.

333
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,913
Somehow it doesn't feel right.

334
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:41,113
You so easily exposed the trick that she risked her life

335
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:44,513
to carry out on the suspicious looking three.

336
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:48,414
No. Her actual purpose was...

337
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,613
What the...

338
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,213
Director Habanaka!

339
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:57,013
Are the contents of the written confession true?

340
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,713
Written confession?

341
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,513
It's written!

342
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,313
In the manuscript of Ms. Yasue Komai that you gave to the AD!

343
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,713
That she was one of the members of the notorious band of robbers

344
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,513
that consisted of Kuramichi Habanaka,

345
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,414
Denji Shibakaru and Ronpei Sakaba, in the past!

346
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,713
She says that evidence of this is in her cell phone.

347
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:23,713
And that the money that you stole is in Tohto Bank ATM!

348
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:26,813
No. This must be some kind of mistake...

349
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,213
As to whether this is a mistake or not,

350
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:33,014
we'll hear you out at the police station.

351
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:01,913
Come to think of it, it seems to have been found.

352
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:04,313
From inside the cushion in her room.

353
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:07,514
The 500,000 yen that she newly withdrew from the bank.

354
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:13,713
If she had 500,000 yen on her,

355
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,413
why did she go out of her way to...

356
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:17,313
Because she wanted the police

357
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:19,713
to realize that the 500,000 yen was stolen.

358
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:22,413
Otherwise, that trick couldn't have been exposed.

359
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,813
In other words, it was a trick schemed to expose what happened.

360
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:30,113
Yeah, her purpose was to set the three up as suspects for murder

361
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:32,313
and while under the surveillance of the police,

362
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:34,913
to expose their crime as a band of robbers.

363
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:39,713
She indicated the evidence and wanted them arrested.

364
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:42,113
But, it's amazing you figured it out.

365
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:46,113
That she still hadn't touched the 500,000 yen that served as evidence.

366
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,413
Two million yen was the amount stolen

367
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:50,713
at the last murder robbery that occurred.

368
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,213
Divided by four this would amount to 500,000 yen.

369
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:54,713
If she regretted the murder and quit her life of crime,

370
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:58,213
I figured she wouldn't use it.

371
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,113
By the way, although there were many reasons

372
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:02,913
how I found out that they were a band of robbers,

373
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:04,413
the decisive reason

374
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:08,013
was the phrase that the old man, Shibakaru mumbled.

375
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:10,413
But I didn't think that the boy

376
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:14,313
was watching us going in and out of this room.

377
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:17,913
The Inspector saw us

378
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:20,313
and hinted that we were the witnesses.

379
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:23,513
However, that old man already knew that the witness

380
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,913
was the boy Mamoru Ganno.

381
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:28,913
It's proof that he knew Ms. Komai

382
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,113
was on good terms with the bereaved Mamoru.

383
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:34,013
But, isn't it cruel?

384
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:38,013
To set Mamoru up as the eye-witness to complete the trick?

385
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,313
It seems that she was being threatened.

386
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:42,513
Saying that if she didn't want Mamoru to find out that

387
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:43,613
she belonged to a band of robbers,

388
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,413
she had to hand over money

389
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,913
or write the continuation to the manuscript,

390
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:49,513
or that they would kill Mamoru

391
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:51,913
unless she return to the group.

392
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:55,013
That's why she set Mamoru up as the eye-witness.

393
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:59,213
Because she figured the police would protect the eye-witness.

394
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:04,013
And, she probably tried to make up for her crimes by killing herself.

395
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,513
But, that was a big mistake.

396
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:10,113
On top of driving Mamoru's parents to death,

397
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:16,513
she made him lose the friend that he finally found too.

398
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:18,014
Lose?

399
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:23,713
Come to think of it, everybody was saying...

400
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:26,313
That guy is missing one side.

401
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,514
That guy?

402
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,013
Rum.

403
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:31,513
He hurt is eye in some accident.

404
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:35,314
And lost one of his eyes, which seems to be made of glass.

405
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:43,914
Hide!

406
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,913
We don't get along.

407
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:53,614
I'm sorry. If everyone loses his job...

408
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,313
What's this?

409
00:23:58,314 --> 00:23:59,913
Fog.

410
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,713
Is everybody okay?

411
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:03,513
Ryo!

412
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:05,514
Where are you?

413
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:12,514
