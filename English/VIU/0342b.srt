1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,598
The ring's nowhere in sight.

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,498
It's so small that it can be hidden anywhere, too.

3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:15,298
Right, Ran?

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,598
What's the matter, Ran?

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,698
I'm worried, so I'm going to go see how Ms. Akane is.

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,699
Ran!

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,798
What are the bad things that happened

8
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,698
that grandma was talking about?

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,898
Oh, that.

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,598
Recently, there were two incidents

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,499
where we experienced close calls.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,399
Madam, the brakes aren't working!

13
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,099
Madam!

14
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,398
The second time was on a clear, fine morning.

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,499
When I was taking a walk with grandma along Holland Slope near our house.

16
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,999
Look out!

17
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,198
Well, we were saved by a hairsbreadth,

18
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,498
but losing the ring is the third bad thing that happened,

19
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,998
so Grandma Tae is probably fed up.

20
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,199
Goodness.

21
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,399
Ms. Akane, this is Ran.

22
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,499
Ms. Akane.

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,298
It's strange.

24
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,498
I'm sure that someone who came into the waiting room took it.

25
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,199
Sonoko!

26
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:51,999
Ran.

27
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,598
Ms. Akane is not in the waiting room!

28
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,599
What?

29
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,398
The wedding dress was on the chair

30
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,398
and Ms. Akane was nowhere in sight.

31
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,998
Don't tell me that Ms. Akane put on an act just as Ms. Mika had said,

32
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,198
and actually stole the ring herself?

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,699
Akane's not that kind of person!

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,498
Let's go look for her.

35
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,298
But what about the ring?

36
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,499
Without it, there'll be no wedding.

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,698
I'm really bothered about the Hydrangea in the picture.

38
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,398
Hydrangeas signify "A change of heart".

39
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:32,199
I think we'll find the ring in a place where the Hydrangeas are.

40
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,699
Mr. Shinya, what's with the wedding?

41
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,298
Well, Ms. Akane disappeared.

42
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,698
What? The bride's gone?

43
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:44,998
Yes.

44
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,398
We were just thinking of splitting up and looking for her.

45
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,498
I'll help look for her, too.

46
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,598
Thank you.

47
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,099
I'll go look for the ring.

48
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:01,299
Hydrangeas. Where do I look for them?

49
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,799
Ms. Akane!

50
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,799
Ms. Akane!

51
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:13,098
Hydrangea... Change of heart...

52
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,698
Music box?

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,998
Change of heart...

54
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,498
Siebold...

55
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:20,298
Wait a second. I learned of it before.

56
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,299
Dr. Siebold is the one who took Japanese plants back to Europe.

57
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:28,799
And, one of the main ones was the Hydrangea.

58
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,698
The old scientific name for this flower is Hydrangea otakusa.

59
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:42,399
The name was taken from Siebold's Japanese wife's name, Otaki.

60
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,499
So, that's the story.

61
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,398
Hold on.

62
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,598
Could it be that Ms. Akane's picture was not about

63
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,799
what the flower signified, but...

64
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,598
Otakusa. "Otaki-san".

65
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,198
"Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

66
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,699
Right!

67
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,199
I found it!

68
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,598
"Otaki-san". "Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

69
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,599
My goodness.

70
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,999
I don't know who hid it, but...

71
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,098
I get it.

72
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,299
This fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

73
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,698
Ran!

74
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,898
Conan!

75
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,298
I found the ring!

76
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:14,098
Really?

77
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,898
Is something the matter?

78
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,599
Well...

79
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,598
This is...

80
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,798
Ms. Akane's high heel shoe!

81
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:28,798
It's not normal for her to go around with just one shoe.

82
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,698
I'm sure that she was kidnapped here.

83
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,298
We find the ring.

84
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,099
And now Ms. Akane's kidnapped?

85
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:44,627
Only one shoe was found by the windmill shed.

86
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,826
This is...

87
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,226
What's going on?

88
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,326
I'm just assuming from the circumstances,

89
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:54,726
but I think she was dragged away against her will.

90
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,126
No, do you mean she was abducted?

91
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:58,626
Don't be ridiculous!

92
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,726
I'm sure she couldn't take staying here and fled.

93
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,426
I checked at the departure gate of Huis Ten Bosch

94
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:07,026
and found that she hasn't gone outside yet.

95
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,726
It seems that Akane in the past

96
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:12,426
had a man that her parent's had decided she get married to.

97
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:16,726
I think that she is still seeing that man.

98
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:22,826
And maybe she had planned to embarrass Shinya, to begin with.

99
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:27,126
No way! I know her best!

100
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,326
Grandma's right.

101
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:32,426
Shinya, you've been completely deceived.

102
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:34,726
Like they say from long ago, "Love is blind".

103
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,727
No!

104
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,926
You're talking about the man that was Akane's father's apprentice.

105
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,126
That's an old story that goes back 10 years ago.

106
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,126
He left 10 years ago

107
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:47,526
and hasn't contacted her even once, since!

108
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:51,326
Well, without the bride,

109
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,226
we can't possibly have the wedding.

110
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,026
After the engagement and all,

111
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,426
if it turns out that the wedding is canceled,

112
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,427
it will be a blow

113
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:01,326
to the trust that people have in the Ohga Financial Group.

114
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:04,326
If the wedding is really going to be called off,

115
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:07,226
then Shinya's promotion to Vice-President of the bank

116
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,827
will probably have to be re-considered.

117
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,427
Dear.

118
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:19,026
She's slim and her hair is about this long.

119
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:22,726
I think she was wearing a pink one-piece dress.

120
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,126
I wonder if you mean her?

121
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,626
Have you seen her?

122
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:29,126
Yes, she went into the windmill shed alone.

123
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,826
About what time was it?

124
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:34,326
It was just about the time I came back from lunch break.

125
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,926
So, maybe around 1 pm.

126
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,826
About 1 pm.

127
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:42,426
If in one in a million chances, she was abducted as you say.

128
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:46,526
Are you saying that the one who took her away is here among us?

129
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,626
I can't say for sure,

130
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:51,426
but I think the probability is high.

131
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:55,226
How rude! Do you know what you're talking about?

132
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,826
Calm down, Mochida.

133
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,026
And just what are you planning to do gathering us together like this?

134
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:06,826
Ms. Akane was seen going into the windmill shed about 1 pm today

135
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,626
by a sales clerk at the cheese store.

136
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:13,326
So, I'd like to know where you were at around 1 pm.

137
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,326
Checking for the alibi.

138
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:19,426
I was here adjusting the books.

139
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:23,026
I was here with my wife all the while.

140
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:27,226
Around 1 pm, I was horseback riding in Friesian Horse Land.

141
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:32,026
Since the wedding was cancelled, I was drinking at the lounge here.

142
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,326
What about you, Mr. Takahashi?

143
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,126
1 pm?

144
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:36,926
I think that's just about the time I went to the Glass Museum again

145
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,927
to look at the antique glass.

146
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:41,926
Just as I thought.

147
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,526
-Can I borrow it? -Yes, sure.

148
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,126
If you want the pictures that are in it,

149
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,226
they'll print it out for you at the front desk.

150
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,127
Okay!

151
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,727
Thank you.

152
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,226
May I ask you something, Mr. Mochida?

153
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,227
What is it?

154
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:01,426
Is there something special about Ms. Akane's family?

155
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:06,126
Her father used to be a renowned glass craftsman in Nagasaki,

156
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,527
but passed away 10 years ago.

157
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:11,126
Anything else?

158
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:13,526
There are rumors that he committed suicide

159
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,626
because Ohga Bank pressured him

160
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,326
to return the money that we financed him.

161
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,526
Suicide?

162
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:22,926
The glass workshop that grandma owns in the city used to be his.

163
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,326
Grandma bought the workshop

164
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,426
that the bank forfeited as collateral.

165
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:28,826
She wanted the workshop,

166
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,126
so she pressured him to return the money

167
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,326
and got a hold of the workshop.

168
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,426
That is what some people say, but that's wrong.

169
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:39,327
All we did was carry out a legal transaction.

170
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,826
Well...

171
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,826
Yes. This person came.

172
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:50,926
He was drinking beer alone right through for about an hour.

173
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,126
Yes, I remember her.

174
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,126
She seemed to have really liked it and rode twice.

175
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,827
Oh, I see. Thank you so much.

176
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,427
This isn't the place. It's more to the back.

177
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:10,326
Here? The long hand fits.

178
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,826
So it's 3:05 pm now.

179
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:13,827
Wait a second.

180
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:17,226
Which means that this picture was taken not at 1 pm sharp,

181
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:18,726
but rather at 2:05 pm.

182
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:19,926
Since it's a faceless clock,

183
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,626
when the long hand and the shorthand overlaps,

184
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,227
it looks to be 1 pm sharp.

185
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:26,327
I thought something was wrong.

186
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:29,526
If the abductor abducted her at the windmill shed at 1 pm,

187
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,426
and is here at 2:05 pm.

188
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:35,026
Akane is probably confined somewhere

189
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:39,427
that's not too far away between the windmill shed and the flower clock.

190
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:43,727
I've got to find her quick.

191
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:49,026
You mentioned that you like high places, didn't you?

192
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,427
Right.

193
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:53,527
-You mean I get to ride that? -Yes.

194
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,527
Gosh. Where is she?

195
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,626
The melody sounds strange.

196
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,627
I get it! Some bells aren't ringing.

197
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,027
Could it be...

198
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,526
Aren't you riding?

199
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,926
No way. I hate high places

200
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,826
and just thinking about it sends chills up my spine.

201
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:26,826
So go ahead and enjoy yourself.

202
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,127
And you're still so young.

203
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,327
Ms. Akane!

204
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:04,127
Mr. Takahashi's going to kill Grandma Tae.

205
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,626
Hello.

206
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,826
Conan.

207
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,726
Where's granny? Where's Grandma Tae now?

208
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,826
Grandma is...

209
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:16,426
She went to ride the balloon with Mr. Takahashi.

210
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,327
Yes, the hot air balloon. Luftballoon.

211
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,127
I feel like a bird.

212
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,837
That's...

213
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,736
What's that?

214
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,237
A bomb?

215
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:05,737
There he is.

216
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:07,437
We're not going to make it.

217
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,336
What's that?

218
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:29,036
No! Don't touch it!

219
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:32,336
It's a triggering device that will set off the bomb set up on the balloon!

220
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:33,936
That's why don't touch it!

221
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,537
What?

222
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:45,836
I guess you two saved my life.

223
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,937
I'm so glad, grandma.

224
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,836
Akane, I'm so glad you're okay.

225
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,536
Shinya, I'm so sorry.

226
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,536
Mr. Takahashi...

227
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,136
Mr. Takahashi?

228
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,236
Akane, did you know him?

229
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:01,237
Yes.

230
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,836
What is the meaning of this?

231
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,937
What do you mean grandma was in danger?

232
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,237
Sonoko.

233
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:29,536
Sonoko!

234
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,536
I'll explain.

235
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,836
What?

236
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,336
Sonoko.

237
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:37,136
This entire case to begin with,

238
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:41,536
started with two people with different ideas acting at the same time.

239
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:44,536
Therefore, it looked as if one person was scheming everything.

240
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:49,836
Grandma Tae, one of them was you, wasn't it?

241
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,736
What?

242
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:55,637
Since you were against the marriage between Shinya and Akane.

243
00:14:56,737 --> 00:15:00,636
-Grandmother! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

244
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:02,737
I'll get better after a little rest.

245
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,836
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

246
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,636
How could you do that?

247
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,236
Conan, please bring the thing.

248
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:13,537
Okay.

249
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:17,137
Ms. Akane, here you go.

250
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:20,636
You found the ring!

251
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,637
Thank you.

252
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,236
-Conan. -I wonder where it was found?

253
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:27,136
You know the fountain by Mauritz Square, don't you?

254
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:29,537
He seems to have found it there.

255
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,636
Leaving it too close to yourself

256
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:35,236
would increase the chances of us finding it when we go looking for it.

257
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:39,436
Since Grandma Tae said so, you hid it at the fountain.

258
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,236
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

259
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:42,836
Yes, that's right.

260
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:46,736
Then, what was the picture of the Hydrangea about?

261
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,136
I was deceived by that, too.

262
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,936
At first because the Hydrangea signifies a change of heart,

263
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:55,136
I thought it was criticizing Ms. Akane for her change of heart.

264
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,936
But there was another meaning to that picture.

265
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:59,536
Another meaning?

266
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:03,236
The water of that fountain flows like that of a waterfall, doesn't it?

267
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,336
Yes.

268
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:06,536
The scientific name that was given to the Hydrangea in the beginning

269
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,936
was Hydrangea otakusa,

270
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,936
a name that Siebold had given it.

271
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:15,536
He called it Otakusa after his wife's name Otaki.

272
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:19,236
Otakusa. "Otakisan". "Taki" (waterfall), right?

273
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,136
-That's what it was. -Yes.

274
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,136
Did you know about it?

275
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,336
Yes.

276
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,736
Although that picture looked to be criticizing Ms. Akane,

277
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,036
it was actually indicating where the ring was hidden.

278
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,736
Now you know.

279
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,236
The people who stole the ring are

280
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,537
grandma and Ms. Mika!

281
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:43,736
But, Ms. Akane being abducted was a mere coincidence.

282
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,136
She felt responsible for losing the ring

283
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:49,336
and gave up on marrying Shinya.

284
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:52,137
Then, on her own initiative, she decided to disappear.

285
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,737
What happened after that, Ms. Akane?

286
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,636
I went out from the waiting room to the back yard,

287
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,136
I coincidentally found Mr. Takahashi

288
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:09,137
and I secretly followed him.

289
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:22,736
Mr. Takahashi, what are you doing?

290
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,636
I'm going to give it to that old lady.

291
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,036
Have you forgotten?

292
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:32,336
Your father passed away all because of that old lady.

293
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:35,736
The one who stole the ring is that woman called Mika, you know.

294
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:36,737
No way.

295
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,336
Of course, the old lady told her to do so, though.

296
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,736
Please let me go through with what I've planned.

297
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,636
And, till Conan came to save me,

298
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:48,536
I was locked up in Carillon Symphonica.

299
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:50,436
Then he...

300
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,736
Yes, he's the one who had been chosen as Ms. Akane's groom in the past

301
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,436
that Grandma Teo was talking about.

302
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:55,736
What?

303
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,836
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

304
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:01,936
When I saw Mr. Takahashi yesterday with Sonoko and the others,

305
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:03,936
I was really surprised

306
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,636
because it's been 10 years since I last saw him.

307
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:09,136
Ms. Akane, you saw Mr. Takahashi last night, didn't you?

308
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:12,536
Yes, I asked him why he came.

309
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:18,536
He answered that he came to watch my wedding from afar.

310
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:20,636
But, I was worried whether he was really telling me the truth

311
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,536
and if that was all there was to it.

312
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,836
Mr. Takahashi, isn't it about time you got up?

313
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:28,437
Just how long do you intend to stay sleeping there?

314
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,236
Since when did you realize what was going on?

315
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,836
I thought something was strange to begin with,

316
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:38,136
because although you said you were from Hotaru,

317
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:40,536
when you saw Ms. Akane in her wedding dress,

318
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,536
you spoke in the Nigasaki dialect and said she was beautiful.

319
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:46,936
You're the one who tampered with the brakes of grandma's car

320
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:50,036
as well as dropped the rock from above the stone wall, right?

321
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,536
Yes, that's right.

322
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:56,736
Ms. Akane's father was killed by this old lady!

323
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,736
Mister was suddenly pressured to return the money

324
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:01,036
that Ohga Bank had loaned him,

325
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,037
and committed suicide out of desperation.

326
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:08,037
I've never forgotten the miserable sight of her father, not even once.

327
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,336
Mister!

328
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:14,636
Mister, why'd you do this?

329
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,937
How could you leave Akane all alone?

330
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:20,736
This all happened just because

331
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:24,136
the old lady wanted a glass workshop for her pastime.

332
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:25,436
Just before all this happened,

333
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:28,337
we were gradually losing orders from our big dealers.

334
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:32,436
I went to ask a wholesaler in Hotaru where mister had transactions with,

335
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,336
if he knew what was going on.

336
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:37,436
He finally admitted that he was reducing order to us

337
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,336
because he was concerned about Ohga Bank.

338
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,937
Wrong!

339
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:44,536
Father.

340
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:47,536
My mother liked Mr. Katori's glassworks.

341
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:50,136
So, wanting him to somehow continue,

342
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:52,936
she even gave him advice on how to manage the workshop.

343
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:53,937
What?

344
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,336
However, Mr. Katori who was a craftsman through

345
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:58,236
and through refused to lend an ear.

346
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:01,636
He insisted saying, "My glasswork is only for those

347
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:03,336
who see the value in them".

348
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:05,636
He kept making fantastic glassworks spending time,

349
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,936
putting his all into them.

350
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,536
Of course his works were expensive

351
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,536
but they were indeed masterpieces.

352
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,636
However, they didn't make out

353
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,736
and he went more and more into the reds.

354
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,236
As a result...

355
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,336
As a result, he started delaying payments for the loan he had with us.

356
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,736
First, he delayed 3 days, a week,

357
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:26,636
then two weeks and so on forth.

358
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,836
We're not all that big a bank either,

359
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:29,837
so we couldn't afford this to go on forever.

360
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:30,936
That's a lie!

361
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,436
It's not a lie.

362
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:34,136
It's a lie.

363
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,637
It's not a lie, Mr. Takahashi.

364
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,236
It's a lie!

365
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,136
Mister isn't such a weak person.

366
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:44,736
He used to sweat from early morning to late at night

367
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:49,636
teaching me, who knew nothing, from A to Z.

368
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:53,536
Grandma, you were against Ms. Akane getting married

369
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:55,536
because you blamed yourself for not being thoughtful enough

370
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:58,736
and driving to Ms. Akane's father suicidal, right?

371
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:02,337
That's why it really hurt for you to look at Ms. Akane, right?

372
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,537
Grandma.

373
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,936
So, since Ms. Akane found out

374
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:10,736
that Mr. Takahashi was attempting to kill grandma,

375
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,536
she was locked up.

376
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:16,736
I know it's not something that can be forgiven.

377
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:21,236
But please forgive Mr. Takahashi.

378
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,437
Akane.

379
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:24,536
Grandma.

380
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,036
Please, I beg you.

381
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:27,536
-Grandma. -Chairwoman!

382
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,936
Mochida, about playing the role of the father of the bride,

383
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:32,236
although he's quite young yet,

384
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:35,536
why don't we have Mr. Takahashi do it?

385
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:38,536
Of course, I totally agree.

386
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:39,936
Grandma.

387
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:43,336
Then, you're approving of them getting married?

388
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,136
The ring was found, so most naturally.

389
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,936
Oh, I'm glad!

390
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:50,736
Grandma had intended things to turn out this way, to begin with.

391
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:51,737
What?

392
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,236
She was intending to approve of their marriage

393
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:56,136
when the ring was found.

394
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,836
How do you know?

395
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:03,236
The sculpture of that fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

396
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:08,436
Aphrodite jealous of Psyche who had fallen in love with her son, Eros,

397
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:11,336
gives Psyche many trials to accomplish.

398
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,636
However, she finally approves both to see through their love

399
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:17,536
after Psyche accomplishes everything that was dished out to her.

400
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:21,636
That fountain describes this final scene.

401
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:24,236
Grandma knew of this Greek mythology

402
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:27,036
and had the ring hidden there.

403
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:28,936
She even deliberately left the picture of the Hydrangeas behind as a hint,

404
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:32,336
pointing to "Taki", Siebold's wife,

405
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,537
isn't that right, grandma?

406
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:40,036
It' so full of western letters that I have no idea what it's about.

407
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:42,536
-Oh, my. -Just as expected of you, grandma.

408
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:45,137
When things get inconvenient for you, you try to brush it off.

409
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:06,636
I do.

410
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,836
Do you promise

411
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,636
to love him?

412
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,337
I do.

413
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:12,037
I'm supposed to get married to Mr. Kyogoku!

414
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:15,436
Sonoko.

415
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:18,136
Ran took it!

416
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:20,937
Not my fault.

417
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,836
"Next Episode" -It's because

418
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,336
there have been

419
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,837
a lot of weird people around us lately.

420
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:31,637
I have a feeling that something bad might happen soon.

421
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,836
What? That brat ran away from home?

422
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:36,536
How sassy, the next time I see him, I'll...

423
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:38,936
No, he went to take care of Ai who's sick in bed.

424
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,037
What?

425
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,637
Shinichi.

426
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:46,237
Ran?

427
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:48,136
Next Conan,
