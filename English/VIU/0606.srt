2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,450
Have you made up your mind?

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,250
Yes, since it's a rare opportunity,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,650
I plan to take on the duty of lay judge if I am chosen.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,050
I see... if the time comes around,

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,550
please don't worry about your classes

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,950
and complete your role as a lay judge to your heart's content.

Thank you very much.

Is this a new picture?

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,050
It was donated by the chairman of the PTA.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,650
It's a pretty unusual picture, isn't it?

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,550
If you will excuse me...

13

Ms. Kobayashi!

16

Is it true that you were chosen to be a lay judge?

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,750
Why do you know about it?

From our Youth Detective Squad network!

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,350
What kind of case is the hearing for?

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,050
There's this thing called duty of confidentiality,

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,550
and you're not allowed to talk about the case!

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,850
Just a little bit won't hurt, will it?

23

Just to us, the Youth Detective Squad!

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,950
I said no, and I mean no.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,950
-Wait Ms. Kobayashi! -Just tell us!

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,050
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's capable of serving as a lay judge?

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,950
We should worry about it after she's chosen.

28
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,050
True.

Swollen eyes touch the heart.

Tears are start of all dramas.

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,550
Ms. Kobayashi becomes a lay judge?

32
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,450
What are the contents of this case of concern?

33

"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -Yeah! I really didn't do it!

41
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:42,256
Then why did you confess to the crime?

42
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,256
I told the police that I didn't do it, either!

43
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,856
But, I was pressed to confess because there was blood on my clothes.

44
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,456
You mean the blood of the victim

45

that was on your clothes at the time you were arrested?

46
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:59,056
Yeah... besides the hair and other stuff too.

47
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:02,756
The hair and footprints that were left behind at the scene of the crime.

They said they had all the evidence necessary so...

49
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:08,556
That's why you signed the written confession form?

50
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,156
But, all I did was break into the house.

That guy?

You just called the victim, Mr. Ishigaki "that guy",

I hope she doesn't end up embarrassing herself.

Yes, your honor.

The defendant Toshio Iwamatsu

115
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:35,156
broke into a residence located on 4-5 Akebono-cho,

116
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,756
by cracking the window of the study of Mr. Tadashi Ishigaki,

the president of a real estate company, who owns the residence.

While he was rummaging the house,

00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,456
Mr. Ishigaki who came home and found him, confronted him.

120
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,056
Then Iwamatsu who had a knife on him

121

-stabbed the victim in the stomach. -Objection!

122
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,456
You say he possessed a knife,

123
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,556
but was the murder weapon specified?

124
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:59,056
No, it hasn't been found yet.

125
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:02,356
Please delete that point.

126
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:03,556
Agreed.

127
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,656
Just as expected of mom.

Not so fast, it's just started.

129

The whereabouts of the murder weapon is unknown.

130
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:15,856
The defendant with blood on his clothes

131
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:20,156
was found near the scene of the crime.

132
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,456
And as a result of interrogation,

133
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,756
he confessed to committing the crime.

134
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,856
The charges and applicable penal statute is homicide,

135
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:34,956
Criminal Law Article 199.

136
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,756
Does the defendant agree to the charges?

137
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:47,256
I didn't do it! I'm innocent!

138
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:55,056
What is your opinion, attorney?

139
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,556
I plead not guilty on behalf of the defendant

140
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,656
with regard to the murder charge.

141
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:00,756
Not guilty...

142
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,256
The court will now proceed to evidence examination.

143
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:13,756
First, may I draw your attention to the autopsy report?

please confirm with the monitor display right in front of you.

146
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,456
What could it be?

147
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:27,856
I guess the corpse or something is being displayed.

148
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:28,956
What?

149
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,656
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's going to be okay.

150
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:34,556
It may be tough for lay citizens,

151
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:38,156
but it is the work of the lay judges to perceive the facts.

152
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,356
The cause of death is exsanguinations

153
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:44,056
through stab wounds in the abdomen.

154
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,856
The murder weapon is thought to be a sharp object.

155
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,856
The blade seems to be approximately 15 centimetres.

156
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:55,156
We shall now proceed to witness testimony.

157
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,256
"Sachie Hara (66)"

158

You're the housekeeper hired at the victim's residence, correct?

159
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:08,156
Yes. I've worked for five years already.

160
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:11,356
Please tell us about the time the incident occurred.

161
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:17,756
I was cleaning the room on the second floor like always that day.

162
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:21,956
Then, I thought I heard noise from downstairs.

163
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,856
Since Mr. Ishigaki told me that

164
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:26,256
he would be eating out after playing golf,

165
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,556
I thought I just imagined hearing something.

166
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,356
I finished cleaning and went downstairs.

167
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,656
Are you back?

168
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,856
I wonder why the window's open.

169
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:48,856
Sir?

170
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:57,656
That'll be all.

171
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:03,156
Any questions from the defense?

172
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,756
When you went to the room where the crime was committed,

173
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,756
you didn't see the culprit anywhere in sight, is that correct?

174
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:13,356
No, I just saw Mr. Ishigaki bleeding and lying on the floor.

175
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,856
The lay judges should take note that

176
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:19,856
the witness is merely the primary discoverer,

177
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,156
and that she did not see the defendant

178
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,256
and the victim confronting each other

179
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:27,756
as the prosecutor had just read off.

180
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:35,356
"Toru Tsukano (46)"

181
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,656
You're the younger brother of the late wife

182
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:39,956
of the victim, correct?

183
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:45,156
Yes. I worked under Mr. Ishigaki as managing director.

184
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:47,656
It seems that on that particular day you visited him about work

185
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:50,156
and encountered that incident, correct?

186
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,756
Regarding transactions,

187
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:54,756
we needed the president to settle the accounts immediately, you see.

188
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,956
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

189
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,456
Did something happen?

190
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:05,656
Mr. Tsukano! Mr. Ishigaki's...

191
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,956
President...

192
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,056
President!

193
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:17,056
Ms. Hara, please call an ambulance right away!

194
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:18,156
Yes, sir!

195
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:24,056
Lay judges, after the death of my older sister,

196
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,856
the president was the only family member

197
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,856
that I had left that I could rely on.

198
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:31,056
Please carry out the maximum penalty

199
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,456
to the one who took his life.

200
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:42,956
Lay judges, if you have any doubts or questions,

201
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,356
please do not hesitate to ask.

202
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,956
Then, if you will allow me...

203
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,556
Go ahead.

204
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,156
I hear that the murder weapon hasn't been found yet,

205
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:55,956
but does that mean that the culprit fled along with it?

206
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,456
That is what we thought too,

207
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,956
so we've been trying to track down the culprit

208
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,656
based on possible escape routes,

209
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,756
but we haven't come up with anything yet.

210
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,556
The defendant was arrested 20 minutes

211
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:08,756
after he was reported to the police.

212
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:10,556
From the Ishigaki residence which is the scene of the crime

213
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:11,656
to the place the defendant was arrested,

214
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,556
even if he were to run at top speed, it would take more than 15 minutes.

215
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:17,556
Thus, it is unthinkable that the defendant had any extra time

216
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,656
to get rid of the murder weapon

217
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,656
outside the investigation area of the police.

218
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:25,856
Then, where is the murder's weapon?

219
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,756
That's a tough one for Madonna.

220
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,956
It's a tie for now.

221
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,456
What you're seeing now is the study

222
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,556
where the crime was committed.

223
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,556
The culprit snuck in from the window,

224
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,256
and was rummaging through the room

225
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,056
when the victim returned home and found him...

226
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,656
Oh my...

227
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:45,856
What is it?

228
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,356
If you are in doubt of anything,

229
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,156
please do not hesitate and ask.

230
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,656
Yes, sir, then...

231
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:03,756
Yes!

232
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:08,056
Ms. Kobayashi, you don't need to raise your hand.

233
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,856
Go ahead.

234
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:15,556
The picture in the room, could it be that it's upside down?

235
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,756
The picture?

236
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:20,656
Yes. The same picture was decorated in the principal's room too.

237
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,056
So, perhaps...

238
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:26,756
It's true it's hard to tell which way is up with that picture.

239
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:29,956
What does that have to do with the case, though?

240
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:34,356
There has been no report of the picture

241
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:37,056
being moved during investigation.

242
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,856
The defendant doesn't seem to have any recollection

243
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,956
whatsoever of the picture either.

244
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,556
What does it matter?

245
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:46,656
What?

246
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:50,656
Right, who cares about such an incomprehensible picture?

247
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:53,356
Let's say that it is as you say,

248
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,856
what does that have to do with this case?

249
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:59,456
I'm sorry. It's okay about the picture already.

250
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,856
Please continue the hearing.

251
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,656
The picture is upside down?

252
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,320
Although there are disadvantageous evidence against the defendant,

253
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,820
Madonna seems to be having a tough time getting her point across.

254
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I guess Ms. Kisaki is much too difficult to take on.

255
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Mom's hanging in there, isn't she?

256
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
For today, I guess.

257
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,720
But, who knows if Madonna is the type

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,920
to shrink away from something like this.

259
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,720
Conan, are you bothered about Ms. Kobayashi's question?

260
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,520
If what Ms. Kobayashi said is true,

261
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,620
I thought that maybe somebody could've turned the picture upside down.

262
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,420
It could be that Ms. Kobayashi's mistaken, right?

263
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm sure she's nervous too

264
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,820
because she's acting as a lay judge for the first time too.

265
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
I guess so.

266
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,020
If the picture really is upside down,

267
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,420
there should be a reason for why it's the way it is.

268
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,620
Shall we try going?

269
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,220
I guess it's over here.

270
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,120
They seem to have a guest over.

271
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Maybe we should wait until mom gets here?

272
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,620
No way, who cares?

273
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,220
This is the spot where he collapsed, right?

274
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,920
My... what brings the great detective over here?

275
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Did Attorney Kisaki still want something?

276
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,820
No, I've just come to check out the scene of the crime involving the case.

277
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Are we intruding on you?

278
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,820
Be my guest.

279
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,920
I was only confirming some things for the next hearing.

280
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,520
Have you found anything that can turn the case over in your favor?

281
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,020
Did you already check the picture?

282
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,620
Picture?

283
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,520
One of the lay judges mentioned it, didn't she?

284
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,520
It's about that picture, right?

285
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,420
She mentioned something about the picture being upside down but...

286
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,720
Ran, how is it when compared to the picture

287
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,620
you were checking on the internet a while ago?

288
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,920
No doubt about it. Just as Ms. Kobayashi pointed out,

289
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,420
the picture is upside-down.

290
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,320
So, what does that have to do with the case?

291
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,420
The owner of the picture wouldn't put the picture

292
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
on the wall upside down, would he?

293
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,820
So exactly who hang it upside-down?

294
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,920
Take the picture down!

295
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Yes!

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,220
It was put on the wall with magnet.

297
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,220
Don't tell me that this is...

298
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
blood?

299
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,120
It couldn't be.

300
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,820
I can see if it were on the outside,

301
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,420
but why would there be blood stains on the inside?

302
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,620
Maybe somebody with bloody hands touched it.

303
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,620
An IOU?

304
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,920
The borrower's signed acknowledgement of the agreement and a bill?

305
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,620
I see, so the picture frame was being used as a hidden safe.

306
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,420
This is...

307
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,820
An IOU amounting to three million yen?

308
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,520
"Iwamatsu Toshio"

309
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,920
The borrower is Iwamatsu?

310
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,720
Isn't that the defendant's name?

311
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,420
If the defendant broke into the house

312
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,520
to search for this IOU to begin with...

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,620
We've found more than vital evidence.

314
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,820
I've heard that the president,

315
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,120
other than his main line of work,

316
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,520
was engaged in questionable monetary dealings behind the scenes.

317
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,620
Do you knew about this?

318
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,820
The president was very secretive about that case,

319
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,720
so I don't think he told anyone about it.

320
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Moreover, I found out for the first time myself,

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,420
that such a thing was hidden behind the picture.

322
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Will you get the details from him over there?

323
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,220
Please come with me.

325
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,920
I've got to tell mom about this.

326
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,220
Ms. Hara, how about you?

327
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,120
I knew nothing what so ever about the picture too.

328
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,520
If the defendant was the one

329
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,920
who put the picture back on the wall upside down,

330
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,420
I wonder why he didn't take the IOU and all?

331
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,620
That's probably because

332
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
when he removed the picture and was about to check it,

333
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,520
he heard the housekeeper coming down from upstairs,

334
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,720
so hastily put the picture back on the wall upside down and fled.

335
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Why would he go through the trouble of putting it back on the wall

336
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,920
when he could just easily flee together picture and all?

337
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,120
Because he stabbed somebody, was delirious,

338
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,720
and couldn't think clearly! Do you understand?

339
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,620
Something's not right.

340
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm sure that anything being hidden behind the picture

341
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
would've had to be a secret.

342
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,120
Then, why did the culprit know about it?

343
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,920
Wasn't there a flower vase on top here?

344
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,520
What?

345
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,820
A flower vase?

346
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,820
See, because although there's a vase mat here,

347
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,220
there's no flower vase on it.

348
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,820
True.

349
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
The surrounding area besides

350
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,920
where the flower vase must've been is discolored.

351
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Do you know something, Ms. Housekeeper?

352
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,120
What?

353
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,720
It was a flower vase that Mrs. Ishigaki used to use.

354
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,320
It was placed there even after she passed away,

355
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,320
but recently Mr. Ishigaki got rid of it.

356
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,620
Is that so?

357
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,920
I thought that it dropped and cracked

358
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,320
when he got into a struggle with the culprit or something.

359
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,120
Even during investigation of the scene of the crime,

360
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,320
no cracked fragments of a flower vase came up.

361
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
But, Conan, was that your name?

362
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,320
You've really got a keen sense of observation, I should say.

363
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,020
He always notices the trivial things.

364
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,720
If you will excuse me, then.

365
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
Strange.

366
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,820
The way the woman looked really flustered

367
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,920
when I asked about the flower vase.

368
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,420
She must know something.

369
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,820
I hear you found Mr. Iwamatsu's IOU.

370
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,320
It seems that the defendant had a motive for killing the victim.

371
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,720
So, he didn't randomly break in to the house simply to steal?

372
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I will submit it as crucial evidence at the next hearing.

373
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Wouldn't it be better if you just withdraw

374
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,320
the not guilty plea and enter a plea bargain instead?

375
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,820
I don't need you to worry about

376
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,320
how I carry on my defense strategies.

377
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,520
Why do I care if you embarrass yourself in front of the lay judges?

378
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,220
Mom, are you going to be all right?

379
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
I'll be fine, Ran.

380
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,520
The more disadvantageous the case seems to be,

381
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,420
the more fired up I get, okay?

382
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,320
In order to get out of this fix,

383
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
the truth about this case has to be disclosed.

384
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,320
And, I'm sure that the key are the upside down picture

385
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,020
and whereabouts of the lost flower vase!

Was the weapon found?

388
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,920
This may be the first time

389
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,020
Ms. Kisaki who's had a successions of victories

390
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,820
will experience losing a case.

391
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,120
That's person's actually not the culprit.

392
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,220
What?

393
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,520
Who said so?

394
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Show time, dad!

395
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,020
Okay, off I go!

396
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,220
We're counting on you, Pops!

397
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,320

-What? -Flippity flop.
