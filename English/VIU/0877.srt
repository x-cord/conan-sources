1
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:15,547
"Yoshi Koda (77)"

2
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,846
A commemorative coin?

3
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:27,747
Robber?

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,546
Robber!

5
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:34,047
Somebody help!

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,046
The smell is gone.

7
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,047
-Let's see... -Move, move it! You rice ball kid!

8
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,746
It hurts...

9
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:05,646
I've got a bump!

10
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,146
You jerk!

11
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:09,947
You're not getting away! Hold it!

12
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:15,247
Hold it, you violent jerk!

13
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,947
Hold it...

14
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:36,646
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,046
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,646
A star-crossed fate descends upon a robber

17
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,646
that gets entangled with Genta.

18
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,346
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,246
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,947
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,240
"The Two Who are Born to Meet"

22
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,760
Yeah, you got a bump...

23
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,060
It looks painful.

24
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm going to get that guy and turn him in to the police.

25
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,660
Of course we'll help you!

26
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,760
And why were you walking by Oku-Beika, Genta?

27
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,160
It's quite some distance from Beika-cho.

28
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,560
That's...

29
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,060
We've got to find him quickly or he'll get away!

30
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,160
That's right!

31
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,660
You only saw him from behind, right?

32
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,860
Yeah. He was wearing a red jacket and jeans.

33
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,960
There's nothing conclusive.

34
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,260
I guess we start by splitting up and ask around.

35
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,360
Please wait!

36
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:14,260
Calling him the violent guy wearing a red jacket is inconvenient.

37
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,860
So let's give him a temporary name!

38
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,360
-Temporary name? -Temporary name?

39
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:18,561
Is it necessary?

40
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,160
How about Gonbei?

41
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,160
After all, "The Nameless Gonbei" is a term for an unknown man.

42
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,860
Gonbei?

43
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:30,260
Since he's Gonbei who knocked Genta down,

44
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,360
how about Gonta?

45
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,260
You're starting to sound like Dr. Agasa.

46
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,160
Nice!

47
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,760
On your toes as usual, Haibara!

48
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,660
That's a fantastic name!

49
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:42,860
Since he's Gonbei who knocked Genta down, we call him Gonta!

50
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:43,960
Fantastic!

51
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,460
But it sort of sounds like Dr. Agasa, no?

52
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:48,660
They're not making fun of me, are they?

53
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,761
Probably not.

54
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,761
It hurts...

55
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,261
Right. I fell from there.

56
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,761
He's to blame.

57
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,760
At any rate, I've gotta get out of here quick.

58
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,460
Wait. Nobody's seen my face.

59
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,161
So long as I change clothes...

60
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm not the perpetrator!

61
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:30,160
I was made to change clothes while I was passed out!

62
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:34,560
Do you think that the police would believe a such a convenient story?

63
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,661
Right?

64
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,460
How was it, you guys?

65
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:46,060
-No good. -No eye-witness information.

66
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,260
Same here!

67
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:50,560
Darn it! Where did that violent man go?

68
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,561
It's Gonta.

69
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,861
Oh, right.

70
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,461
Hey, you guys.

71
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,860
What're you doing here?

72
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,760
Rather, did you see a suspicious looking man?

73
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,061
One who was wearing a red jacket and jeans?

74
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:09,460
He's a robber that broke into Mrs. Koda's residence right up here.

75
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,560
He was a robber?

76
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,360
Yeah.

77
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,060
Who?

78
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,260
Did you see that man by any chance?

79
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:20,460
Oh, no. It's not that I saw his face.

80
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:21,860
He was probably fleeing

81
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,560
and Genta was in his way so he knocked Genta down.

82
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:25,860
Knocked him down?

83
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:27,460
Yeah!

84
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:31,360
See! He hit my head and got a bump!

85
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,760
So, I was thinking of catching him

86
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,960
-and turning him in to the police. -Yes, sir.

87
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,160
Officer Takagi! There no one who matches the description of that man

88
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,460
on the security cameras near the station.

89
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,960
I see.

90
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,260
If so, it's possible that he's still hiding somewhere near here.

91
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,360
-Let's go! -Yes!

92
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,560
So he wasn't just some violent man

93
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,560
but a vicious robber. That Gonta.

94
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,561
-Yeah! -Yeah!

95
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,560
We've got to catch him with our own hands

96
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,860
-no matter what. -What now?

97
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,261
It's getting pretty exciting but...

98
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,560
It seems that he's a lone perpetrator.

99
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,460
If worse comes to worse, I'll use this.

100
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:08,460
Haibara! Conan! Let's go.

101
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,861
Okay.

102
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,060
It hurts.

103
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:26,060
Darn it. How'd I get here?

104
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,061
What am I doing in a place like this?

105
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:34,160
Who am I?

106
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,660
I wonder if I have a name card or something.

107
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,260
A driver's license, maybe.

108
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,461
Something.

109
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,561
Why do I have something like this?

110
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,160
Excuse me.

111
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,060
Do you know me?

112
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,560
Yes?

113
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,960
I can't remember who or where I came from.

114

You don't even remember your name?

No, not at all...

116
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,561
A red jacket and jeans.

117
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,960
Don't tell me you're the robber on the run?

118
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,560
Robber?

119
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,761
No way.

120
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:19,360
I want to ask you some questions.

121
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:21,860
No! I don't want to get arrested!

it seems Gonta is suffering from amnesia.

Yeah.

00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,760
What?

171
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,260
Ujihara?

172
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:12,860
"Masuzo Ujihara (68)" -Do you know him?

173
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,760
Masuzo Ujihara.

174
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,660
He's a loan shark that runs his office in front of Beika Station.

175
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,560
There's a bad rumor going around that

176
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:23,460
he maybe doing evil things to those who can't pay back their debts.

177
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,261
A typical villain.

178
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:29,261
Let's trace Gonta's tracks.

179
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:35,260
He knocked the granny of that house and fled.

180
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,260
He then knocked me down really hard over here.

181
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:41,261
You mean you lost sight of him just about here?

182
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,760
What's the matter?

183
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,660
It looks like somebody rolled down from here.

184
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:48,160
Okay!

185
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:50,960
Gonta couldn't make this turn

186
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,260
and accidentally fell from here.

187
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:57,260
He then hit his head and lost his memory.

188
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:58,561
Let's take a look below!

189
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,261
There seems to be no mistake about it.

190
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,760
There are two traces.

191
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,560
There were two people who came falling here?

192
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,160
-That's right. -That's right.

193
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:15,560
Somebody got messed up with him!

194
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,160
When Gonta turned the corner,

195
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:21,560
he bumped into someone and they fell down here!

196
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,160
But if so...

197
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,360
That person who got messed up in this

198
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,760
would've naturally reported this to the police, right?

199
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,260
But Officer Takagi said nothing like that!

200
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,961
Why didn't that person go to the police?

201
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:40,560
I see. He doesn't know what happened to him

202
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,360
because he lost his memory.

203
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,960
Wrong, Conan.

204
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,060
The one who lost his memory isn't the one who got messed up

205
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:50,660
but it was Gonta!

206
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:52,560
Edogawa, don't tell me that...

207
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah.

208
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,260
Come to think of it, something bothered me back then.

209
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,661
The clothes he was wearing was strangely baggy.

210
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,360
Genta?

211
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,360
The guy who knocked you down.

212
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,660
Was it really Gonta?

213
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,461
Well, now that you mentioned it.

214
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:15,360
I feel like he was a little bigger.

215
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,460
I guess that settles it.

216
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:22,060
They switched after they changed clothes after falling here!

217
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,460
In other words, the Gonta that we've been pursuing...

218
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:28,560
He's not the robber that knocked me down hard.

219
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,160
But the one who got messed up in the incident?

220
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:35,260
And yet he believes that he's a robber

221
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,660
and is still on the run.

222
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:39,960
When he actually did nothing wrong.

223
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,360
"Obstructing Performance of Public Duty" "Trespassing"

224
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,960
"Damage to Property" "Entering a Restricted Area"

225
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:44,461
"Larceny" "Mugging"

226
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:49,261
In order to run, he ended up doing things that are really bad.

227
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:53,260
We're going back to Beika-cho.

228
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,760
Beika-cho?

229
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,960
That Ujihara guy, right?

230
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,160
Yeah.

231
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:02,160
If that guy made the real robber commit the robbery

232
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:04,760
then it's understandable why he appeared at the crime scene.

233
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,760
To check on whether things went well or not.

234
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:10,160
Worried about whether they'd find out if he was pulling the strings.

235
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,561
That's very likely!

236
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:14,860
If we get to him,

237
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,661
I'm sure we'll find the real perpetrator!

238
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,147
"Ujihara Finance"

239
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,347
Who are those kids?

240
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,832
The sixth floor.

241
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,732
How are we going to check on him?

242
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,933
That rice ball kid.

243
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,633
Maybe.

244
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,532
Conan?

245
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,932
Officer Takagi.

246
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,132
What brings you all here?

247
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,832
Rather, why are you here?

248
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,732
We came to talk to Masuzo Ujihara.

249
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,932
We're going to show him this drawing.

250
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,232
Oh, no.

251
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,032
Officer Takagi.

252
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,132
He's...

253
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,832
The elevator's undergoing maintenance.

254
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,932
That man is not the robber.

255
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,132
Wait...

256
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,233
I was just over imagining things.

257
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,132
It's this man.

258
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:26,033
You know him, don't you, Mr. Ujihara?

259
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,932
I don't know such a man.

260
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,632
But, when you looked at this drawing you...

261
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,833
Wait. Wait a minute.

262
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,532
Something's strange.

263
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,032
Strange?

264
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:51,033
Because he just happened get messed up and is a victim.

265
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,932
Messed up?

266
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:58,432
Despite that, Ujihara looked flustered when he saw that drawing.

267
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,132
It sure is strange.

268
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,432
Wait a second.

269
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,233
If I'm not mistaken, Inspector Megure...

270
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,933
So, that's the story!

271
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,232
Yes?

272
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:14,333
We'd like to talk to you regarding the robbery that occurred at Oku-Beika.

273
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,832
He was the one after all.

274
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,333
You remember me, don't you?

275
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,732
I'm not letting you get away!

276
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,833
Wait!

277
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,733
How dare you knock me down!

278
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,832
Yes.

279
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,132
Officer Takagi?

280
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,333
We've captured the suspect!

281
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,132
"Koda" -The robber that I saw!

282
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,132
This red jacket and jeans!

283
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,632
Oh, no, that's not it...

284
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,332
That's not it?

285
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,532
Rather it's pretty complicated, you see.

286
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,133
Shinya Torimaru.

287
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,532
I just happened to hear yesterday.

288
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,732
About a loan shark called Ujihara.

289
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,932
There's a rich person called Koda in Oku-Beika.

290
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,532
"Ujihara Finance"

291
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,932
If you can't make money, go and rip money off of that house.

292
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:21,032
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

293
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:24,533
It's easy, because the old lady lives alone.

294
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:29,732
And since I thought it sounded profitable,

295
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,732
so I snuck in.

296
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,532
Then I found the old lady fainted

297
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,032
and the whole house was ransacked.

298
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:41,333
I figured I'm inside already so I may as well.

299
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,532
A commemorative coin.

300
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,333
Robber?

301
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,332
Robber!

302
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,833
Someone help!

303
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,532
The smell is gone.

304
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,633
-Let's see... -Move, move it! You rice ball kid!

305
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,733
Hold it...

306
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:28,933
It hurts...

307
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,833
Right. I fell from there.

308
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,333
He's to blame.

309
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,433
At any rate, I've gotta get out of here quick.

310
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:46,032
Wait. Nobody's seen my face.

311
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,733
So long as I change clothes...

312
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:01,132
I thought I'll get away fine

313
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,832
by switching places with this guy.

314
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:09,332
Was I knocked out one after the other by two robbers then?

315
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,332
There weren't two robbers

316
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,732
but two people did break in.

317
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,333
Inspector, so that means that he...

318
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,532
I didn't commit any robbery

319
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,432
but I thought I had to flee and committed one crime after the other.

320
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,933
How terrible.

321
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:34,032
Mr. Torimaru, wasn't it this voice?

322
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:37,532
That you heard at Ujihara Finance yesterday?

323
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:40,833
What shall I do?

324
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,932
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

325
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,532
Right, it's him!

326
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,632
He was being threatened by Ujihara yesterday!

327
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,633
Me?

328
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,132
-What? -What?

329
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,532
It's just as you deduced, Conan.

330
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:59,532
Because if this man called Ujihara didn't provoke him,

331
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,833
he wouldn't have been so flustered.

332
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,132
Which means...

333
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,832
In other words, he snuck in to rob the house,

334
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,632
knocked Mrs. Koda out

335
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,832
While he was ransacking the house,

336
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,532
Mr. Torimaru sneaked in and he fled.

337
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:21,832
That man, who fled, sprained his leg and was crouching

338
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,332
when Mr. Torimaru came running in.

339
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,132
So, that's the story!

340
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,733
Finally. It explained everything.

341
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:35,532
All we've got left to do now is charge Ujihara with instigating this man.

342
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,233
Then this case is closed.

343
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:43,232
I was a robber after all.

344
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:47,632
I think Gonta was threatened to do it and had no choice.

345
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:51,032
What? My name's Gonta?

346
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,032
No. We named you that on our own.

347
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,132
Right! That's right!

348
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,832
My name's Gonta.

349
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,232
Taro Gonno.

350
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,432
-Taro Gonno? -Taro Gonno?

351
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,132
That's what I was always called as a child.

352
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,633
Gonta.

353
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,332
I remember everything now.

354
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,232
The company I worked for went bankrupt and I was depressed.

355
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,932
But yesterday...

356
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:20,532
"Ujihara Finance" -Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

357
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,333
I was surprised but...

358
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:29,033
Robbery is exciting.

359
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,332
That's why I snuck in.

360
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,032
I was burning with passion

361
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,333
after finally finding something I could live for.

362
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,232
He's worse than me.

363
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,632
Take these two away immediately.

364
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:48,733
Yes, sir!

365
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,132
Come to think of it.

366
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,632
Why were you walking in a place like this?

367
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,932
Right, we didn't ask you that yet!

368
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:23,232
It was because...

369
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,332
I can't remember.

370
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,932
Don't tell us that you forgot, Genta?

371
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,833
You were knocked down and hit your head so...

372
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,032
It can't be.

373
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:35,032
I can't remember.

374
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,932
I wonder what it was?

375
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:40,033
"Japan's Best Eel Bowl, this way" -Are you asking us that question?

376
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,432
"Next Episode"

377
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,232
Watch closely now.

378
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,333
What was that about?

379
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,733
Hey, Conan!

380
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,033
That's the shop I just went to.

381
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:12,333
Next Conan, "Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 1)"
