1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:00,852
"National High School Spring Kendo Tournament"

2
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:04,652
Ran and I came to the Toto Gymnasium to cheer on Hattori,

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:07,252
who traveled to Tokyo for a kendo tournament.

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:13,152
But while there, we came across a murder.

5
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,452
Furthermore, at the crime scene...

6
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,452
Who are you?

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,352
Who? Me?

8
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:24,152
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

9
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:26,152
Soshi Okita.

10
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,252
Hattori.

11
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:30,852
Maybe I misheard you,

12
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:35,252
but did you just say something about winning the tournament?

13
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:39,652
You think you'll beat me?

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,652
Of course, idiot!

15
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:44,552
Then we don't need to wait until the match.

16
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:48,752
Why don't we settle this here?

17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,852
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

18
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:56,852
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

19
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,652
Heiji and Okita, Kazuha and Ran.

20
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:00,852
How will the case and their contest end?

21
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,552
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:04,252
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,652
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:52,944
"Kendo Tournament of Love and Mystery (Part 2)"

25
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,644
Now that I've caught you...

26
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,644
you're not getting away.

27
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,744
"Soshi Okita, Kyoto Senshin High School Second-Year" -No.

28
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,544
It is me who have come to find you.

29
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,644
Come and get me.

30
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:12,044
My throat's wide open.

31
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:14,444
You're exposing your left shoulder.

32
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,044
The tip of your sword is low and to the back.

33
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:21,744
That's the Yagyu Shinkage-ryu cleaving stance.

34
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,644
In that case...

35
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:29,844
That's the Tennen Rishin-ryu hiraseigan stance.

36
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:35,644
Your blade is sharply inclined as you aim for your opponent's left eye.

37
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,944
Shut up already.

38
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:40,944
If you want me to hit you, I will!

39
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:43,844
Hold it!

40
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:49,344
I wish I could keep watching,

41
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:52,644
but I can't let you mess up the crime scene anymore than you have.

42
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:58,344
But if you can solve this case by the time the matches resume,

43
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,844
then we won't have to cancel the tournament.

44
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,244
Really?

45
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,144
Wait, Officer Sato.

46
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,344
Why not?

47
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,444
Those three are

48
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,344
"Tsuneyuki Yokote, Akane Sadamori, Nenji Norimura" -our only suspects.

49
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,644
Besides,

50
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:15,244
it seems like there's something romantic about this tournament.

51
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:16,644
Hey...

52
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:18,044
Excuse me.

53
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,744
Could I go to the bathroom?

54
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:23,544
It doesn't look like I can use that one.

55
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,144
Sure.

56
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,144
We've already asked you all our questions.

57
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,144
In that case, excuse me.

58
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:32,744
I want to know

59
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,944
who is Hattori's opponent?

60
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:37,844
Will he make it to the finals?

61
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,244
And will Hattori be able to win

62
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,644
and confess his feelings to Kazuha?

63
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:48,644
So, did you find a box cutter in the bathroom?

64
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,544
No, not yet.

65
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:53,344
Then we'll be checking your belongings.

66
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,844
We'll start with your sword bag.

67
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:57,144
Okay.

68
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:00,844
"Toto Gymnasium" -Why did you bring your sword bag to the bathroom?

69
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,244
The same reason as these boys.

70
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,644
I have a match tomorrow,

71
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,244
so I was going to do some practice swings

72
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:09,144
after using the bathroom.

73
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:10,644
I see.

74
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,144
Well?

75
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:15,644
We took apart the two swords that were in the bag.

76
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:18,244
We didn't find a box cutter.

77
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:22,244
We were curious about this thing

78
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:24,444
"Black Ink" -that was in the bag though.

79
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:25,844
Black ink?

80
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,544
Why do you have this?

81
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:31,944
Since I'm a referee, I keep a spare bottle on hand.

82
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:36,444
At this tournament, we paint over the name of the losers.

83
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,044
Let's see.

84
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:41,644
Hattori's opponent in the finals is...

85
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:42,944
"Kurahiko Namakoshi" -There.

86
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:46,144
It's Kurahiko Namakoshi.

87
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,844
Hey, Namakoshi.

88
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:50,144
You should forfeit if your leg is cramping.

89
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:54,344
I'm okay. I'll win in two more games.

90
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:57,544
But you're up against Kaiho Academy's Hattori next.

91
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,644
Yeah.

92
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:02,444
You've never beaten Hattori before.

93
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:05,144
Sounds like he'll make it to the finals.

94
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:09,644
So who's Okita's opponent?

95
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:12,344
There it is. They're representing Tokyo, huh?

96
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,744
Wait, what's with this guy?

97
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:17,644
His name sounds really strong.

98
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:22,944
There isn't a box cutter in my backpack.

99
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,844
Huh?

100
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,944
This chocolate is melted.

101
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:28,044
You're right.

102
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:31,044
Just the ones on the edge are really melted.

103
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:34,744
It's because I had it in my jacket's inside pocket.

104
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,744
My body heat must've melted it.

105
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:38,844
Let's see.

106
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:42,344
Okita's opponent is from Tokyo, so...

107
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:46,044
Excuse me.

108
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,744
"Onimaru"

109
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:50,344
This name...

110
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,344
He's Okita's opponent.

111
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,044
Are you all right?

112
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:56,844
Yes.

113
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,144
Onimaru!

114
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:03,044
Is it true that you're forfeiting your final match?

115
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,744
What? Forfeiting?

116
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:10,044
Yes. Something came up and I must go home.

117
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:12,144
What came up?

118
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:16,344
The governor of Tokyo wants to make me an honorary citizen.

119
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:18,244
He's at my home right now.

120
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,044
That's incredible.

121
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,944
I thought only the elderly were given that title,

122
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:23,044
but it's not inconceivable

123
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:26,244
since you've won two consecutive national tournaments at your age.

124
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:31,444
I don't believe I'm worthy of that title yet.

125
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,244
I'm going home to reject his offer.

126
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,444
What a waste.

127
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,844
Don't worry. I'll participate in my semi-final match.

128
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:40,744
It's someone I've been wanting to fight.

129
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:42,344
I see...

130
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,644
Two consecutive national tournament wins?

131
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:48,644
That means he's the strongest kendo swordsman in Japan, right?

132
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:50,644
And since he won't fight in the finals

133
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,344
even if he wins his semi-final match,

134
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:58,044
"Winner" -if Hattori fights, he'll win automatically!

135
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,944
What's Heiji doing?

136
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:03,444
His match is starting in 20 minutes.

137
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,544
It's from Ran.

138
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:09,244
Congratulations?

139
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,944
Heiji hasn't won yet.

140
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,944
Iori, how did it go?

141
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,544
As we expected.

142
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:24,044
Then let's watch as my future husband

143
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:26,244
takes first place.

144
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,544
"Toto Gymnasium"

145
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,944
You seem to like taking pictures.

146
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,944
Yeah, I guess.

147
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:38,044
But the month's almost over, and you've hardly taken any.

148
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:41,044
-What? -Last month and the month before that,

149
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,044
you took close to 200 pictures.

150
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,444
I can do what I want!

151
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:47,744
Someone's calling.

152
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,744
I'm answering it.

153
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,744
Hello?

154
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:55,344
Huh? This isn't Tsuneyuki's phone?

155
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:59,844
Are you the girl who likes cutters that Tsuneyuki said he met?

156
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:02,244
Cutters?

157
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:05,344
As in those big sailboats.

158
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,344
I've been into sailboats recently.

159
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:11,144
It's got nothing to do with the murder weapon!

160
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:14,544
Didn't this old man hear the culprit mention box cutters?

161
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:18,644
Now that I think about it, I think they said "cutter."

162
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,444
-Give me a break. -Cutter?

163
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:25,644
None of them had a box cutter though.

164
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:28,644
And we didn't find one in the victim's bag.

165
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,544
No. Inside the bag,

166
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:33,844
we found a wallet, a towel, a phone, a magazine,

167
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:39,144
an empty bag of stomach medicine and the box it came in.

168
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:42,744
There are still traces of that medicine around his mouth.

169
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:46,444
His throat must have been cut right after he took it.

170
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:51,644
But we have to find that box cutter.

171
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,144
You're right.

172
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:56,944
Did you hear any strange noises inside the bathroom?

173
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:00,044
Like the blade of a box cutter being broken.

174
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:04,344
Speaking of noises, I heard rustling outside the bathroom.

175
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,144
That was probably the sound of them

176
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:09,844
throwing the armor out the bathroom window.

177
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,944
I heard that, too.

178
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,944
I heard a scratching sound after that.

179
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,644
I heard it, too.

180
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,644
So did I.

181
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,444
In any case,

182
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:27,544
they cut the throat of a ranked swordsman with a single blow.

183
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,744
As another ranked swordsman,

184
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,644
that makes you the most suspicious.

185
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,344
But...

186
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:36,444
Don't be so sure.

187
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,544
If they were wearing this outfit,

188
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,844
maybe he thought they were a student in the tournament

189
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,344
and let his guard down?

190
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,544
Okita!

191
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,344
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,444
That's evidence!

193
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:50,944
Yeah, but I was curious.

194
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:54,044
See? There's blood on the thigh armor,

195
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,044
but none on the gauntlets.

196
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:59,444
And there's some on the butt of the skirt.

197
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,444
Don't you think that's weird?

198
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,244
You're right.

199
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:07,544
Oh, right. I knew I recognized this old man.

200
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:11,444
He was the referee for my quarter-final match.

201
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:12,744
Really?

202
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:16,144
Yeah. He crashed into the guy I knocked back with my sword

203
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,744
and was bleeding from his nose.

204
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,844
A nosebleed?

205
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,744
I remembered something.

206
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,444
It was the way he spoke.

207
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:25,944
The hoarse-voiced man, who told their friend

208
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,344
to bring them another box cutter,

209
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:31,444
spoke with a Kansai accent like you boys.

210
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,344
What?

211
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,644
Hey, you.

212
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,644
You said the victim's wife was on her way.

213
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:39,844
Is she bringing him a change of clothes?

214
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:43,044
Yeah, she said she was.

215
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:45,644
What about a change of clothes?

216
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:46,944
Sorry, Kudo.

217
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:49,944
This case is mine.

218
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,056
Ten minutes until the semi-finals start.

219
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,256
We don't have a choice.

220
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:00,456
Could you have them cancel the tournament

221
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,056
and bring the tournament organizer here?

222
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,056
Got it.

223
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,056
Hold on.

224
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:08,656
In ten more minutes, we'll get more than our money's worth.

225
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:10,456
More than our money's worth?

226
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,756
Does that mean you know who did it?

227
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:13,956
Yeah.

228
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:17,156
In that case, I've figured it out, too.

229
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,656
Since we can't find the murder weapon,

230
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,656
the killer is...

231
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,956
that old man!

232
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:27,256
Huh?

233
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:31,156
What? How'd he kill someone when he's blind?

234
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:33,056
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,756
That's a sword cane.

236
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,156
He senses his opponent like Zatoichi

237
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:42,956
and slashed his throat with a backhanded slice.

238
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,256
Well, sir? Am I right?

239
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,156
Say, "What an awful way to live."

240
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:50,356
Say it and I'll forgive you.

241
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:54,056
Hattori, is this guy an idiot?

242
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,856
Sorry, it's just how he is.

243
00:12:56,856 --> 00:13:00,056
So, do you know who did it?

244
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:02,356
No. What I do know is

245
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:06,756
the victim, Mr. Nukitani, had some kind of beverage in his bag,

246
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:10,256
but after he was killed, someone took it out.

247
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,056
And that person who took it

248
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:16,656
was probably former Self-Defense Force official, Ms. Akane Sadamori.

249
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,556
What makes you think that?

250
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:23,456
Because Mr. Nukitani took a powdered medicine

251
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,556
just before he was killed,

252
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,956
but he doesn't have a beverage on him.

253
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:31,656
Since the chocolate in Ms. Sadamori's bag was melted,

254
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:35,556
she probably had a plastic bottle containing a warm beverage inside it.

255
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:39,056
I told you, I was keeping the chocolate in my inside pocket.

256
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:42,156
Then wouldn't all of it be melted?

257
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,956
Wasn't only the edge melted

258
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,556
because you poisoned a warm beverage

259
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,556
and were keeping it in your bag

260
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,056
until you could give it to Mr. Nukitani?

261
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:54,356
That's why you were hiding in the bathroom.

262
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:56,956
So you could erase the evidence of your attempt to poison him.

263
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:59,656
It wasn't poison, it was laxatives!

264
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,356
I just wanted to inconvenience Mr. Nukitani

265
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:04,256
since he rejected my love!

266
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:07,156
I thought he'd be in the bathroom so I came to check on him,

267
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:09,756
but he'd already been killed.

268
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:10,756
I retrieved the plastic bottle

269
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,856
so I wouldn't be suspected of murder.

270
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,856
It's true. You have to believe me.

271
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:18,056
I don't think she did it.

272
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,756
If she was in a kendo club,

273
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:22,856
she'd know how to put on a skirt.

274
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:27,056
It seems like the killer wore the skirt backwards.

275
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,456
Then we're all innocent.

276
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,456
I used to practice kendo, too.

277
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:34,756
Did you really, Mr. Yokote?

278
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,856
You didn't even know you're not supposed to strike victory poses

279
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,656
during a kendo match.

280
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,656
Isn't that right, Mr. Referee?

281
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,056
Huh? Yeah.

282
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:49,556
It says to in the referee's rules.

283
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,956
I see.

284
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,756
Mr. Nukitani pointed out your lie

285
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,556
when you bragged to your girlfriend

286
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,656
about striking a victory pose after winning a match.

287
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:01,156
You resented him for the embarrassment he caused you.

288
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:06,056
Yeah. I thought I'd embarrass him, too,

289
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:09,456
so I followed and secretly photographed him.

290
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:13,356
Since that woman headed to the same bathroom as him,

291
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:15,556
I thought they might be having a tryst and came to check it out,

292
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,756
but this is how I found him.

293
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:19,856
I wanted to get out of here,

294
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:21,956
but those kids showed up,

295
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:26,356
so I was deleting my photos of him inside the bathroom.

296
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:29,556
That's why you had hardly any photos this month?

297
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,256
Yeah.

298
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:35,756
But Mr. Yokote doesn't have a box cutter.

299
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:38,056
But, Conan...

300
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:41,356
That's right. I don't have a box cutter

301
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,656
and I practiced kendo for a little while,

302
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,256
so I know how to wear a skirt.

303
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,656
Then why don't you put on that thigh armor?

304
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,756
Yeah, sure.

305
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:56,156
I think you cross these long straps in the back,

306
00:15:56,156 --> 00:16:00,056
tie it in the front, and... it's done.

307
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,156
Wrong.

308
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:05,056
You're supposed to tie it under the front to hide the knot.

309
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:06,756
-What? -See?

310
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:07,856
When you tie it correctly,

311
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,956
you can see the blood on the front of the armor.

312
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:13,356
In other words, someone who knew how to wear the armor

313
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,856
deliberately put on the skirt backwards

314
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:19,556
to make it look like the work of someone with no kendo experience.

315
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:24,456
Among the three of you, the only one who'd need to do that is

316
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:28,256
the man dressed as a referee who's obviously a ranked swordsman,

317
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:30,356
Mr. Nenji Norimura.

318
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,056
You're the only one.

319
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:38,656
No way! You still haven't found Heiji?

320
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,456
But his match starts in less than five minutes.

321
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,256
Ran and Conan are missing, too.

322
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:48,156
Maybe they know where Heiji is.

323
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,256
"Incoming Call. Kazuha."

324
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,656
Kazuha's calling.

325
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,356
If I tell her where Hattori is,

326
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,956
she's sure to come here.

327
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,956
But until the crime is solved,

328
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:04,756
we can't afford to lose even a second.

329
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:09,156
But didn't the killer use a box cutter?

330
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,456
I don't have one either.

331
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:14,356
We had it all wrong.

332
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,356
What?

333
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:19,356
Isn't this what the victim, Mr. Nukitani, actually said

334
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,956
while talking to someone on the phone?

335
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,956
"This cutter is bloody and useless."

336
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,956
"Bring me another one."

337
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:30,256
That's exactly right.

338
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,756
There's nothing strange about that.

339
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:38,256
In Kansai, a cutter refers to what you call a dress shirt.

340
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,056
In other words, he said, "My nose bled on my dress shirt

341
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,356
and I can't wear it anymore."

342
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:46,956
"Bring me a new dress shirt."

343
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:50,156
That's it. That's why Mr. Nukitani's wife is

344
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:53,456
on his way here to bring him a fresh dress shirt.

345
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:54,656
Yeah.

346
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,956
"Black Ink" -Though even if his nose hadn't bled on it,

347
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,356
you probably meant to spill ink on Mr. Nukitani's shirt

348
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:02,556
so he'd come here.

349
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,456
But what about the weapon?

350
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:07,556
I don't have a blade.

351
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:10,656
You're carrying it.

352
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,556
You're saying I cut a man's throat with a bamboo sword?

353
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:15,356
Not an assembled sword.

354
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:21,756
If you sharpen a single piece of bamboo and swing it horizontally,

355
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:24,456
the centrifugal force can cut a person's throat.

356
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:27,256
I know someone who cut his neck on a sword he parried.

357
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:30,956
It wouldn't stop bleeding.

358
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:35,156
Yeah. The neck is the weakest part of the body.

359
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,856
The scratching sound heard in the bathroom

360
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:43,556
was you dulling the pointed tip against the wall.

361
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,456
Which means...

362
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:53,756
Mr. Nukitani's blood must be stuck to the inside of your sword bag.

363
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,856
We're going to check your bag.

364
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,356
Okay.

365
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,856
I'm sure you'll find some,

366
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:03,456
even though I tried to wash it in the bathroom.

367
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,356
Sorry, Kudo.

368
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,956
I'm the star this time.

369
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,156
How frustrating.

370
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,256
But why a bamboo sword?

371
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,656
Wouldn't a blade have been better?

372
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,656
That bamboo sword was my son's.

373
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:20,756
What?

374
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:25,356
Two years ago, Mr. Nukitani drove him to suicide.

375
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,156
He drove him to suicide?

376
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:30,356
Two years ago during this tournament's team match finals,

377
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,156
my son won a decisive bout,

378
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,356
but he accidentally struck a victory pose,

379
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:37,056
and his victory was invalidated.

380
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:40,256
Their opponents made a comeback and my son's team was eliminated.

381
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:43,156
My son had a strong sense of responsibility.

382
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,956
Unable to withstand the humiliation,

383
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:47,356
he took his own life.

384
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:51,756
That match was refereed by Mr. Nukitani!

385
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,156
But according to the rules, it couldn't be helped.

386
00:19:55,156 --> 00:20:00,756
Yes. I thought Mr. Nukitani made the right call, too.

387
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,956
Until I saw him ignore the victory pose

388
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:07,956
struck by Kyoto Senshin High School's second man

389
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,856
during yesterday's team match finals!

390
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,156
I see.

391
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:15,256
Yeah. Not only did he not invalidate his victory,

392
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,556
but he gave the student a pep talk!

393
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:21,356
He showed favoritism since they're both from Kansai!

394
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:25,656
So I killed that biased man

395
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,056
with my son's bamboo sword!

396
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,956
He was probably holding this good luck charm.

397
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,156
A good luck charm?

398
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:38,456
That first-year second man said he really wanted to win,

399
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:41,456
so I let him borrow my good luck charm.

400
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:45,456
This Hachidai Shrine charm's been in my family for generations.

401
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,456
I've never lost while wearing it.

402
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,956
After winning his match,

403
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,956
he noticed it sticking out of his uniform.

404
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,256
While putting it back, he said he thanked god

405
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:57,556
while holding it with tears in his eyes.

406
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,856
Maybe you mistook that for a fist pump.

407
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,256
You're lying.

408
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,656
It's true.

409
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:07,656
Apparently the referee told him not to cry during a match.

410
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:12,056
You're lying...

411
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:15,156
You're lying!

412
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:24,256
She's so strong.

413
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,056
What are you doing? Hurry!

414
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:27,856
Hey, wait.

415
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:33,156
The charm.

416
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,756
Kazuha, I brought him!

417
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,756
Ran...

418
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:02,056
The match is over.

419
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:03,556
Victory by default!

420
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:06,056
-What? -Where have you been?

421
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:09,256
Heiji, you idiot!

422
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:11,156
Shall we go?

423
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:15,856
You're not going to meet Mr. Hattori?

424
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,756
I'd like to meet my future husband

425
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:21,456
under better circumstances.

426
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:24,956
This is because you took your sweet time solving that mystery.

427
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:29,856
You idiot, you slowed me down with your nonsense about Zatoichi.

428
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:33,956
Solving? Were you sticking your nose into some case again?

429
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,756
I can't stand detectives.

430
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,856
What an awful way to live.

No one's escaped from my mini-patrol car on these streets before!

434
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,656
I'm hungry.

-Genta! -Genta!

Darn it. My tracking glasses aren't working.
