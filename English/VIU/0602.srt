1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:05,158
-Happy new year, everyone! -Happy new year, everyone!

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:08,558
Detective Conan has entered its 15th year.

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,358
We will continue to solve one case after another this year too,

4
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:16,458
so please stay with us and tune in as you always have!

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,858
Dad?

6
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,058
No way, I haven't done anything.

7
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,158
Dad, nothing's happened yet, you know?

8
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:41,158
I guess he's just wasted from all the drinks he had.

9
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,658
I guess you're right.

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,358
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

11
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,958
Tears are the start of all dramas.

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,658
The mystery that lurks in the tennis court.

13
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:53,058
A sharp deduction is a smash that scores a point.

14
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:54,658
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:56,658
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,058
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,360
"The Devil that Lurks in the Tennis Court"

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Sonoko's tennis coach,

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Mr. Takao Goto will be competing in a tennis match,

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,760
"Karuizawa Highland Resort Park" -so we decided to accompany her

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,360
to North Karuizawa.

22
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,060
Ran, here it goes!

23
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Hey, are you sure it's okay?

24
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,660
Yep, it's okay.

25
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,260
Today's the practice match for the tournament coming up,

26
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,760
so as long as we clean up before it starts!

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,460
There!

28
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,060
What was that?

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,860
"Takao Goto, Yuka Tsuchida" -Why did you bring the daughter

30
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,560
of the Suzuki Financial Group here?

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,860
She just came here to root for me.

32
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,160
I'll bet you're want to make her your girl from now on!

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,860
Don't be silly.

34
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,760
What do you think I'm interested in a slip girl like her?

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm pampering her a bit only

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,560
because she's the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,260
I wonder about that...

38
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,660
It's true.

39
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,460
You're the only one in my eyes, Yuka.

40
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,660
However, the bigger the fish, the better it is.

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,560
If you ever betray me,

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll never forgive you.

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,360
I wonder where Conan went.

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,460
Weren't you with Sonoko a while ago?

45
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,760
Yes, I'm Ran Mouri.

46
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,160
"Fumihiro Azuma (22)" -If it's that little boy,

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,260
he went to the restroom a while ago.

48
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
Would you like me to go look?

49
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,760
No, thank you. I'll go...

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Let me. After all, it's the men's room.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,260
Sorry for the trouble.

52
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,960
This place really is spacious.

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,160
That's the guy I saw a while ago.

54
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,260
I'd like to talk to you about the money I lent you.

55
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,460
That...

56
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,460
Please wait a while more.

57
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,360
"Chie Ootake (19)" -If you don't give it back to me,

58
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I'll be in trouble.

59
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,660
What the...

60
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,960
The fact that I get to enter this tournament,

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,060
thanks to you too, you know, Chie.

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,360
I...

63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,860
See you then, because I've got a match.

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,260
No good!

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
What a nuisance, that broad.

66
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,460
Why can't she just shut up and keep supporting me financially?

67
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,260
Quite a player...

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,160
If he doesn't pay me back,

69
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
what am I going to do?

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,060
Boy,

71
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,960
Ran and the others were worried about you.

72
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,060
Yes.

73
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,260
-Great! -Mr. Goto!

74
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,360
What the heck?

75
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,860
I thought they were on bad terms just a while ago.

76
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,760
Girls are so incomprehensible.

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,460
-Mr. Goto! -Coach!

78
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,760
Game. Goto!

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,860
-Mr. Goto, you're fantastic. -Coach, you're awesome!

80
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,560
Here, the usual honey lemon water!

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,860
Just what I wanted.

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,260
Thank you.

83
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,960
As I thought, Yuka know me the best.

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,660
Mr. Goto, please use this.

85
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,360
Thank you, Chie.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,460
Coach Goto, keep up the good work!

87
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,760
Thank you, Sonoko.

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,160
It's surprising you knew what color I like.

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,260
Well, it's because your racket is always that color, coach.

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,260
Nice play.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,660
Give it your best shot!

92
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,460
I won't goof things up like you did, Azuma.

93
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,860
Captain Azuma, you're really a push-over, aren't you?

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,260
If only he didn't hurt himself,

95
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,260
his place in the tournament wouldn't have been taken by Mr. Goto.

96
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,360
Hey, you know what?

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,260
You're no match for me,

98
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,460
so why don't we change this into a mix double match?

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,560
I'll pair with a girl that doesn't play well to even things out.

100
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,260
Sure. Fine with me.

101
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,760
Sonoko, we're switching to doubles,

102
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,860
so pair with me, won't you?

103
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,160
Me?

104
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,260
Yeah. Please!

105
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,960
Sonoko, how lucky.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Yes, thanks!

107
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,560
He's putting us away and pairing with her?

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,460
What on earth is he thinking?

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Coach Goto!

110
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm counting on you.

111
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,860
Yes.

112
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
-Same here. -Yes!

113
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll do my best!

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,960
Don't get too tensed up, okay?

115
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,560
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
What? Really?

117
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you very much!

118
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,960
Give it your best shot!

119
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,060
Sonoko give it your best shot!

120
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,360
Sonoko, go for it!

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,760
Go for it.

122
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,260
There!

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,860
I did it!

124
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,060
Sonoko, that's the way to go!

125
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,960
Sonoko seems to be getting the hang of it.

126
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,560
You're right.

127
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,660
Sonoko, fight!

128
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,260
What's wrong?

129
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,860
Mr. Goto suddenly doesn't seem to be doing good.

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,460
Coach?

131
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,360
What's up?

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,260
What's wrong?

133
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,860
Are you all right?

134
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,860
-Call an ambulance right away! -Okay.

135
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Coach!

136
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,360
What's with this?

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,960
Mr. Goto!

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,260
What's going on?

139
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,560
The man who collapsed is Mr. Takao Goto.

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
21 years old.

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,260
He's the co-captain of the university tennis club.

142
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,660
It seems that he collapsed from poisoning

143
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,160
in the midst of a practice tennis match.

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,460
According to the hospital,

145
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,660
he seems to have the symptoms seen in aconitine derivatives.

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,360
I see. In other words,

147
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Mr. Goto picked poison weeds that were growing nearby

148
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,260
and ate them?

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
No way, right?

150
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,760
Ran, so we meet again.

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,160
I guess, Inspector Yamamura.

152
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,060
I mean North Karuizawa is in Gunma Prefecture, you see.

153
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,260
An accident or food poisoning seems to be unthinkable.

154
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,160
The coroner says he seems to have been poisoned

155
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,060
10 to 20 minutes before he collapsed.

156
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,160
Which means,

157
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
this is a homicide targeted at Mr. Goto.

158
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
Mr. Goto isn't dead yet.

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,860
Somebody probably gave him poison

160
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,960
of some kind during the practice match and killed him.

161
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
So, like I was saying...

162
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,960
You mean it's not an accident?

163
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,360
Homicide?

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,260
But, how could the killer have done that

165
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,960
during the match in front of a crowd looking at the tennis court?

166
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,260
Come to think of it, the girls were giving something to Mr. Goto.

167
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
Giving him something?

168
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,860
It could be that the poison was inside what they gave him.

169
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,660
Okay! Have forensics rush and check the things they gave him.

170
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,760
Yes, sir!

171
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,860
Hang in there, Inspector.

172
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
No poison was found

173
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,960
when body checking the people involved.

174
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,560
However, toxic reaction was found on the bottle, towel

175
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,460
and racket grip tape that were handed over to him.

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,960
This, and this, then this...

177
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,860
Inspector Yamamura, what're you doing?

178
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,060
You see a lot of scenes like this on police dramas, don't you?

179
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,660
I wanted to do something like this before.

180
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,860
You currently are a police officer.

181
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Mr. Goto's actions during break time

182
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,760
went something like this, right?

183
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,660
I saw Mr. Goto having a fight

184
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,560
with Ms. Tsuchida before the match in front of the locker.

185
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,260
Mr. Goto said that although he's going steady with Ms. Tsuchida,

186
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,060
he's being nice to Sonoko because she's rich.

187
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Hey, just what do you think you're...

188
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
I see...

189
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,360
So, intent to kill built up in Ms. Tsuchida who didn't like the idea.

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,660
Hey, what's with this boy?

191
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,560
You mean the police is going to take

192
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,760
the testimony of a child like this as legit?

193
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
Ms. Tsuchida.

194
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,760
You gave Mr. Goto a drink with poison in it, didn't you?

195
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
No, I'm not.

196
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Poison was detected on the outside of the bottle,

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,960
but not inside the drink.

198
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,160
Is that so?

199
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Well, so it's not that his palms were inflamed

200
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,460
because he was holding the bottle that had poison on it firmly?

201
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,660
And, you miss, were talking to Mr. Goto here a while ago weren't you?

202
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,160
-I was... -I know about it.

203
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Chie is giving Mr. Goto money in order to get his attention.

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,060
She's even using up her tuition for him.

205
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,160
Is that true?

206
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,660
Yes, if I can't pay my tuition

207
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,560
I'm going to have to quit college.

208
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,160
So, Ms. Ootake, you smeared poison on the towel

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,660
and gave it to him, didn't you?

210
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,360
If he wipes his eyes and nose with it,

211
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,160
the toxin would enter through his membranes.

212
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,060
I did no such thing!

213
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
According to the hospital,

214
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,060
no toxins were found on Mr. Goto's face.

215
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,260
Is that so?

216
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,460
Mr. Goto went through the match in a breeze

217
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,360
and he didn't perspire at all,

218
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
so he didn't use his towel.

219
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,460
He removed it from his neck and put it on the bench.

220
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,960
Since it's not us,

221
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,260
it has to be that rich girl of the Suzuki Financial Group.

222
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,760
Mr. Goto probably approached her wanting to get rich by marrying her.

223
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,460
She fell for him and when she found out about it,

224
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,360
she probably got angry and hated him.

225
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,160
No way, I didn't fall for the coach!

226
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,860
I heard he's entering a match, so I came to root for him!

227
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,660
He said that he changes his grip tape each game,

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,960
so I brought him some.

229
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,060
Does Mr. Goto change grip tapes for each game?

230
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,160
Yes...

231
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,660
I've figured it out!

232
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,460
The truth of this case has came to me as a flash of inspiration!

233
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
We will solve this case at the tennis court

234
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,160
because this case happened at the tennis court!

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,860
No joke?

236
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,860
In order to wrap the grip tape around,

237
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,560
first you have to peel off transparent film on adhesive side!

238
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,160
If poison is smeared onto this film,

239
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,860
the toxin will penetrate Mr. Goto's hand each time

240
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,560
he changes grip tapes when he plays a new game!

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Inspector!

242
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,460
The forensics have reported back to us!

243
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,860
Toxin was detected on the used films found inside Mr. Goto's bag

244
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,560
and the tennis glove that belong to Sonoko!

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,960
From Sonoko's tennis glove too?

246
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,760
Just like I deduced.

247
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,160
Come to think of it, Mr. Goto licked his finger

248
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,660
repeatedly saying that the film was hard to peel off!

249
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,760
The killer, after smearing poison onto the films,

250
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,060
put them back in the case and gave it to him.

251
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,660
That's why no toxic reaction was detected from his body!

252
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,060
Yes! In other words, the murderer...

253
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,760
You, Ms. Suzuki!

254
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,060
What?

255
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,360
It can't be...

256
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,160
Hey...

257
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,905
Ms. Suzuki is the one who smeared poison

258
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,405
onto the grip tapes and gave it to him!

259
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,005
Inspector Yamamura.

260
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,205
She may fall in love easily, but she'd never do something like that.

261
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,505
That's right!

262
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:03,405
I didn't do it!

263
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,905
Since Mr. Goto licked his finger repeatedly

264
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,805
when peeling off the films the poison

265
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,205
was not taken into his body!

266
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,605
While he was playing, the poison circulated through his body,

267
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:17,205
he tried to shoot a serve and collapsed?

268
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,405
It hurts...

269
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,605
This is...

270
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,105
I get the picture now.

271
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,505
It hurts...

272
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,105
Her motive is an entangled love affair!

273
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:35,005
She threw herself onto a handsome coach

274
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:37,305
saying that she liked him but was betrayed.

275
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:40,005
So, her prince charming suddenly turned into her hated target

276
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,005
and intent to kill built up inside her!

277
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,805
Ms. Suzuki, come with us to the station.

278
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,905
Hey, I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

279
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,605
I'm sure that it's some kind of mistake!

280
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:51,705
After all, with this much circumstantial evidence before us.

281
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,105
-Stop it! -This is a false charge!

282
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:57,805
I guess Sonoko has to clear the accusations for herself!

283
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,005
I tell you, are you okay, Gunma Prefectural Police?

284
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,705
What's with her?

285
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,705
Is she copying Mr. Mouri?

286
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:13,005
Sonoko, so it's finally come!

287
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,505
Inspector Yamamura,

288
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:17,805
I will tell you the truth of this case from here!

289
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:18,805
-What? -What?

290
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,105
Wasn't the case solved already?

291
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,405
That girl is the culprit, isn't she?

292
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:24,805
That's right.

293
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:27,205
You smeared poison onto the film of the grip tape.

294
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:29,805
Mr. Goto started playing the match

295
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,205
right after he changed the grip tape,

296
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,605
so there's no way that poison would be found,

297
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:36,205
on the towel and bottle that he touched before that!

298
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,405
True, if you put it that way.

299
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:41,705
Besides, although you touch the film with the fingertips,

300
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:45,505
but only Mr. Goto's palm was inflamed from touching the poison.

301
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,805
Which means that the poison was all over Mr. Goto's palm!

302
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,505
I get it! Mr. Goto touched something

303
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:53,405
with poison on it with his hands!

304
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,905
So, the culprit is you, Ms. Tsuchida!

305
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,405
You smeared poison on the bottle,

306
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,705
since you wouldn't touch it with your own hands,

307
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,405
you held the strap and handed it over to him!

308
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:01,905
I didn't do it!

309
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:04,705
If the poison got onto his hand from the bottle,

310
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,005
then there's no way that the poison

311
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,205
would be on the towel that he touched before that.

312
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,105
Then, the culprit is Ms. Ootake!

313
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,105
When he touched the towel he had around his neck,

314
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,805
the poison got on Mr. Goto's hand!

315
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,205
Why would it be me?

316
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,605
Wrong!

317
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:20,305
If the poison touches the skin, a visual symptom would occur.

318
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,305
Since Ms. Ootake gave him the towel with her bare hands,

319
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,905
it's not the towel either.

320
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:26,705
Then, where did the poison come from?

321
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,305
Right! The tennis glove!

322
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,205
Maybe she shook hands with him

323
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,405
with the poisoned tennis glove on

324
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,005
and put poison on the palm of his hand?

325
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:36,405
I see...

326
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,405
Ms. Suzuki, so you're the culprit after all!

327
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:43,105
-Sonoko. -Ran!

328
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,905
That's impossible, you know?

329
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:50,505
Because you ate this cookie and yet you're alive and kicking.

330
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:51,605
Right!

331
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,105
Ran, just what do you mean?

332
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,305
When Sonoko was invited to come to the doubles

333
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,905
I high touched with her when she had her gloves on.

334
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,905
So, if there was poison on it

335
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,105
my hands would also be contaminated,

336
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:04,505
and since I ate cookies with the same hand,

337
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,405
but, I even now...

338
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:09,205
Really?

339
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:13,405
Then just where do you suggest the poison came from?

340
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,905
There're no more culprits left!

341
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:19,005
There was still another way to touch Mr. Goto

342
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,405
who was on the court and get poison on him.

343
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:24,005
It's something that all tennis players naturally do,

344
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,605
and also something that can be done

345
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,105
without getting suspicious even if it was done before a crowd.

346
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:33,405
Mr. Azuma, you're the culprit!

347
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,705
-What? -Captain?

348
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:38,105
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,905
I was at the stands right the whole time and didn't offer anything to him.

350
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,805
How could I poison him, who was at the tennis court?

351
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,405
It was when you did a high touch with Mr. Goto.

352
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,905
During that split second,

353
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:51,005
you smeared poisoned Mr. Goto's palm with poison!

354
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,705
-What? -What?

355
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:57,705
The fact that poison was found on my tennis glove

356
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:00,805
is because the poison was already there on Mr. Goto's palm

357
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:03,305
even before he shook hands with me.

358
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,805
If so, you're the only one who high touched him

359
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,405
before he shook hands with me.

360
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,105
It's absurd.

361
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,905
If I had my hand smeared with poison,

362
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,305
my hand would be in terrible shape too, wouldn't it?

363
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,005
It's after you put on your tennis glove.

364
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,505
There are only two balls in a tennis match,

365
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,305
if it comes flying to the stands, it's manners to return it to court.

366
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,705
But, since you had poison smeared on the palm of your glove,

367
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,705
you bounced the ball back with the back of your hand.

368
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:32,305
And when the match was suddenly switched to a doubles game

369
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,205
and I was chosen to become Mr. Goto's partner,

370
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:37,605
I'm sure you panicked.

371
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,505
Because if the police detected the poison from my glove

372
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:44,005
and suspects someone from the stands held the source of the poison,

373
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:46,305
your plan would go down the drain.

374
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:47,805
Therefore...

375
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:51,705
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

376
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:54,905
You made me take off my glove.

377
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,605
If it were on the bench or something,

378
00:19:56,605 --> 00:20:01,305
it would've been gotten rid of amidst the commotion and all by now.

379
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:04,305
I'm amazed by your deduction.

380
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,605
As if I want to say that.

381
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,305
But, just where do you have evidence?

382
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,405
The evidence is right here!

383
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,705
This ball...

384
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:18,305
When Inspector Yamamura kicked the ball basket a while ago,

385
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:20,805
there was one ball that didn't bounce,

386
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,505
so I thought it was strange.

387
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:27,405
There's a strange slit here on this ball.

388
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:30,305
This is...

389
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:32,205
After doing what he had to do,

390
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,105
Mr. Azuma took off the poisoned glove

391
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,105
and shoved it inside that ball.

392
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,905
Then, he mixed it into the ball basket

393
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,405
so it would be inconspicuous.

394
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,005
You were probably planning to get rid of it,

395
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:45,005
after the commotion subsided.

396
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:49,005
If Mr. Azuma's fingerprints and toxic reaction are found on this glove,

397
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:51,605
that would be conclusive evidence.

398
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:55,305
So, could this mean that I solved this case?

399
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:57,105
I did it, fantastic!

400
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,405
Just as expected of me.

401
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,805
Why would a kind captain like him do something like that?

402
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:08,905
I was scheduled to play in the match tomorrow,

403
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,805
but Goto who was envious of me

404
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:13,805
deliberately tripped me during practice!

405
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:22,205
I'd never trip and fall like you, Azuma.

406
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,705
I couldn't enter the match since I sprained a bone in my leg.

407
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:30,105
And Goto ended up taking my place.

408
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:33,505
To think that the dirty woman chaser stole my position.

409
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,905
Thanks to him, both contract with the sponsor

410
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:37,905
and the scholarship went up in smoke.

411
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,705
I just couldn't forgive him!

412
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:47,105
So, Sonoko was cleared of all suspicion.

413
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,605
Afterward, Mr. Goto regained his consciousness at the hospital

414
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,405
and his prognosis looked positive,

415
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,705
according to Inspector Yamamura.

416
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:19,705
Deduction Queen Sonoko, great work!

417
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,705
Really?

418
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:27,205
To think you would end up being the culprit,

419
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,705
I was dead worried.

420
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:32,605
Ran, you're sure a great friend!

421
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:35,905
So, the case is closed.

422
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,505
Right!

423
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:40,205
-Yes! -Yes. It hurts...

424
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:42,705
It hurts. How could you, Ms. Suzuki?

425
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:43,705
It hurts...

426
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:47,105
Darn. Case is closed, my eye!

427
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,505
As if he had such a scrutinizing mind.

428
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:52,905
I guess the grudge of being set up as a suspect

429
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,605
is not easily forgotten.
