1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:02,572
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:04,272
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:05,872
Investigation with Aya Ueto!

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,272
The promise Shinichi made with her

5
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,972
is recollected along with an old lady's sad memory.

6
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,472
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:11,972
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,473
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:56,276
"Beika Station" -What? Are you serious?

10
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,076
Yeah! It was Suwa and Kobayashi.

11
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,676
-I can't believe it! -Yeah, but it's true!

12
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:01,777
Yuki.

13
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:04,449
You're the guy in the tennis club.

14
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,048
Kitada?

15
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,249
Yuki.

16
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,548
Hey!

17
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,048
Kitada!

18
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,949
Kitada?

19
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:18,749
Kitada.

20
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,048
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook."

21
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:30,749
"Oka High School."

22
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,148
Deduction is all about formula.

23
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:35,348
As long as I applied the right formula,

24
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,249
I can find the answer.

25
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,149
"Beika Park."

26
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,648
Just like I thought!

27
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,949
You know, I knew you were the one.

28
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,249
Now, this is the right answer.

29
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,248
"Aya Ueto and Shinichi, The Promise from 4 Years Ago."

"Kudo."

31
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,548
It's a beautiful spring day today.

32
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,748
And a young, pretty girls like us are dusting.

33
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,848
She is evil!

34
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,848
Because your mother-in-law makes you clean her house

35
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,448
while she's out for something! She is evil. She is!

36
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,548
Oh, god.

37
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,748
Please, you gotta stop talking about the wife and-mother-in-law thing!

38
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,648
I'm doing this because I wanted to do.

39
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,548
And also I never asked you to do it either!

40
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,648
Well, yeah.

41
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:04,448
Anyway, look at them.

42
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,649
They're all books!

43
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,948
It's "The Dark Baron: Night Baron".

44
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:18,548
Yusaku Kudo's books are around here?

45
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,248
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook."

46
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,848
It's "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook".

47
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,848
"TV Drama, appearance: Aya Ueto" -I think...

48
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,448
It was on TV before, right?

49
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,648
Yeah, I know! It was a two-hour drama!

50
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,348
It's my dad's work in his early years.

51
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,949
It's kinda cheesy, especially if I read it now.

52
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,649
Look.

53
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,448
-Isn't she Aya Ueto? -Oh, that.

54
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,148
She and her manager actually came to talk with Shinichi's parents

55
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:49,048
because she was going to be starring for the first time.

56
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,948
Yeah, I think you told me that before.

57
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,848
When was it?

58
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,848
That was when I was 13 years old, so it was 4 years ago.

59
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,248
I was a fan of hers of Aya,

60
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,548
and Shinichi told me that she's coming to his house,

61
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:04,448
So I went up to Shinichi's house to get her autograph.

62
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,448
But Shinichi wasn't paying attention to her really.

63
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,348
He was actually playing with a soccer ball.

64
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,348
And I remember that

65
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:17,048
she had a serious look on her face when she looked at him.

66
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,748
So, I asked him what they were talking about.

67
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:21,848
And he said?

68
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,648
Nothing.

69
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,048
But, I'm kinda curious about what they were talking about.

70
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,349
Shinichi.

71
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,948
Maybe he was asking her out?

72
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,748
Sonoko! You!

73
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,649
How is that possible?

74
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,548
-Somebody's here! -Yeah.

75
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,549
"Kudo" -Yes?

76
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,048
Is Mr. Shinichi Kudo there?

77
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,448
Me?

78
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,348
A young girl?

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,348
Shinichi is not home right now.

80
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,549
Excuse me, who is this?

81
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,349
A young girl, huh?

82
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,448
My name is Ueto...

83
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,048
I'm Aya Ueto!

84
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,348
What?

85
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,649
Aya Ueto?

86
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:19,948
It's for real!

87
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,349
It's really Aya Ueto!

88
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,948
Do you remember me?

89
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,748
Yes, you are Ran Mouri.

90
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,248
You are Shinichi's friend from childhood, right?

91
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,348
Yeah!

92
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:37,548
She is my friend...

93
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,248
I'm Sonoko Suzuki!

94
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,148
Nice to meet you!

95
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,248
Nice to meet you too!

96
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,148
And he is Conan.

97
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,348
-Hi, there! -Hello.

98
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,948
Look. Somebody is getting shy!

99
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,548
Shut up!

100
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,948
So, when is Shinichi coming back?

101
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,548
We don't know that actually.

102
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,548
He never came back since he left for the investigation of a criminal case.

103
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,648
You came here to see Shinichi?

104
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,848
Is it about some investigation?

105
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:05,548
Yes, indeed. Is it possible for you to call him?

106
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:09,848
Well, it's always the answering machine when we call him.

107
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,748
But let me give a try.

108
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,448
Thank you.

109
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,348
He's not gonna answer because I'm here.

110
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,048
Hey! If it's about an investigation, why don't you ask Kogoro Mouri?

111
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,748
I don't think you should!

112
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,548
-Why not? -Because he has been having a major hangover this morning!

113
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:26,948
Man, he's helpless.

114
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,748
It's the answering machine again.

115
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,248
Is that so?

116
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,448
Then, what should I do?

117
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,248
Why don't you leave him a message?

118
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:38,648
Shinichi might call you back later. You never know, right?

119
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,148
You're right. Would you like to tell us what happened?

120
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,749
Okay.

121
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,748
There is an old lady named Fumie Koda in my neighborhood.

122
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:51,148
She's 80 years old and living alone.

123
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,748
She's actually a good friend of mine,

124
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,748
so I often go to her house on my day off.

125
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,548
And just like always, I went to her house this noon.

126
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,848
Grandma! It's Aya! I'm coming in.

127
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,148
Grandma?

128
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,148
I'm came to visit.

129
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:07,749
Grandma?

130
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,748
It's weird.

131
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,849
Where did she go?

132
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:20,048
She often leaves her house without locking the door,

133
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,848
and I thought she did it again.

134
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,248
So I waited for her a while, but...

135
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,148
But she didn't come back?

136
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,748
Right. I started worrying about her.

137
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:31,148
So I went to a grocery store near the house.

138
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,248
And asked...

139
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:35,448
She just passed by a while ago.

140
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,948
So I asked her where she was going.

141
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,748
She said she's going to Beika-cho.

142
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:39,848
Beika-cho?

143
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,948
Yeah. She answered me and just left!

144
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,348
She had this serious look on her face

145
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,948
and she was acting strange as well.

146
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,548
I was kind of worried about her.

147
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,448
I was worried so I came to Beika-cho by taxi.

148
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,748
But I don't know why Grandma came to this town,

149
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,748
so I have no clue where to look for her.

150
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:01,448
Suddenly, I remembered about Shinichi.

151
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,448
It was 4 years ago when I met him.

152
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,348
And I just remembered, now he's a famous high school detective,

153
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,748
and he's also living in this town...

154
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,348
-That's why you visited here, right? -Right.

155
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:15,848
Also, he and I had a...

156
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:16,849
What?

157
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,449
No, it's nothing.

158
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,748
Do you know if she has a friend in Beika-cho?

159
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,348
No, I don't know.

160
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,548
Well then, I'll send a text message to Shinichi's cell-phone

161
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,948
about what happened today, just in case, okay?

162
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,748
What else do you know about this old lady?

163
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,849
What?

164
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,348
The more information you have, the closer you get to solving the case.

165
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:41,848
Shinichi used to say that.

166
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,248
Okay. What else...

167
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,248
Grandma lost her daughter who fell ill when she was young, I heard.

168
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,948
Lost her daughter?

169
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:55,348
It was half a year ago, that I heard about it from Grandma's best friend.

170
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:58,448
It was when Fumie was 40 years old, I remember.

171
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,048
She had a sick daughter, Ayako, who was only 17 years old.

172
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,848
Fumie was a single mother, so she worked and raised Ayako.

173
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:11,148
That day also, she was working from morning.

174
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,448
While she was away, Ayako's condition turned bad suddenly.

175
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,048
By the time Fumie got to the hospital room,

176
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,748
Ayako was already...

177
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,048
Fumie regretted the fact that she couldn't be with her daughter

178
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,648
at the moment of her death.

179
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,948
"Ayako Koda" -She blames herself for Ayako's death, I think.

180
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,648
I never knew that.

181
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:33,548
You know, Fumie never talks about this to anyone.

182
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,748
Actually, you look like Ayako somehow.

183
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,548
The name is similar too.

184
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,148
That must be why she took a special liking to you.

185
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,348
I'm home!

186
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:47,448
Sorry, it took me long. There were so many things to buy!

187
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,548
Welcome back!

188
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,348
Gotta keep it a secret, okay?

189
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,548
Okay.

190
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,948
Grandma was always smiling.

191
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:59,648
I never knew she went through so much before.

192
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,248
She was 17 years old, that's around our age.

193
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,648
It must have been hard for the old lady.

194
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,248
And as well as for her daughter.

195
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,548
If I remember correctly, her daughter loved classical music,

196
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:12,648
especially Mozart.

197
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,948
I'm not sure whether this old lady's daughter

198
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:18,248
has something to do with this case.

199
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,648
Maybe we need to see this case from a different angle.

200
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,748
The main power of the TV was on

201
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,148
when you went in to the living room, right?

202
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,348
You think Grandma was watching TV until she left the house?

203
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,848
Yes, I think so,

204
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:33,548
because the TV schedule in the newspaper was left open.

205
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,448
Was the tea left unfinished?

206
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,948
Then, maybe Grandma was impelled by some kind of sudden thought

207
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,548
while watching TV, and then left the house.

208
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,948
Do you know which channel it was?

209
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,348
Actually, I do know.

210
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,649
While I was waiting for Grandma...

211
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,149
Nichiuri TV.

212
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,048
Nichiuri TV. It was Nichiuri TV, right?

213
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,748
-Yes. -Conan?

214
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,748
I was just trying to find out which TV show she was watching.

215
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,548
You know, there's no newspaper in Shinichi's house.

216
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:05,748
So you're gonna call someone and ask, right?

217
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,148
-No! -What do you mean no?

218
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,748
What? You even can do it?

219
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:13,348
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook (Rerun)"

220
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,049
Hey! That's what we were talking about a while ago!

221
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,648
Is this TV drama, "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"?

222
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,648
They're airing a rerun of it.

223
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,248
-Yeah, you're right! -I didn't know that.

224
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,548
The main actor of the TV show didn't know that it was on TV?

225
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,748
Wait a sec.

226
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,848
I think the shooting of this TV drama was in Beika-cho.

227
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:35,748
Yeah. It was at Beika Station, Beika Park

228
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:37,748
and Shunichi Shitara Memorial House also.

229
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,048
Yeah! It was the one in the old western mansion, wasn't it?

230
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,248
Yes.

231
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,248
It was a musician's house 10 years ago, but since he passed away,

232
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,348
his wife who was also a pianist

233
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,848
made it the memorial house of her husband.

234
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,648
Aya, in that episode, you were attacked by the murderer,

235
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,748
and got locked in the basement in the mansion, right?

236
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:54,749
That's right!

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,048
But we only used the exterior of the mansion.

238
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,848
We actually used the set when we were shooting inside.

239
00:12:58,849 --> 00:12:59,948
You did?

240
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,249
I got it!

241
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,048
I think I know why Grandma came to Beika-cho!

242
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,748
-Yeah? -Are you serious, Sonoko?

243
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:11,249
Yeah. The female high school detective Sonoko Suzuki's deduction is...

244
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:17,149
Always right!

245
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,249
Is she all right?

246
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:27,632
Okay, listen.

247
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:30,231
I think Grandma could not distinguish between

248
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:31,631
TV drama and reality.

249
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,531
-What? -What do you mean?

250
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:36,831
Perhaps, when she was looking at the TV listing in the newspaper,

251
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,631
she found Aya's name.

252
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,831
So she watched this TV drama, from the beginning of the show.

253
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:41,931
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook."

254
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:45,531
However, she fell asleep in the middle of the show.

255
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:49,431
And then, when she woke up as the show approached the end.

256
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,931
On TV, Aya was being attacked by someone,

257
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,731
and got locked up in the basement of the mansion.

258
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:57,831
Because she just woke up, her brain wasn't functioning properly,

259
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,831
and she thought that it was happening for real.

260
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:03,431
Thus, she rushed out of her house, to save Aya.

261
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:06,931
That's why she came to Beika-cho!

262
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:10,431
Well, if so, then she wouldn't turn off the TV, would she?

263
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,731
-What? -It's clear that she turned off the TV.

264
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,631
That means, she knew that it was a TV program...

265
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:18,731
Shut up! Such a minor thing doesn't matter!

266
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,932
Here!

267
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:25,131
Anyway, Grandma should be in the memorial house.

268
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,231
She must be!

269
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,932
What do you think, Aya?

270
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,531
Man, only Sonoko can make a deduction like that.

271
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:36,331
But in fact, it is true that the old lady was watching the drama.

272
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:37,931
The reason she came to Beika-cho

273
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,331
should have something with the TV drama.

274
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,031
What was she going to do?

275
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,831
Guys, we should head down to the memorial house,

276
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,931
rather than stay here thinking!

277
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,632
That's right, let's go.

278
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:52,131
Yes, this old lady came here a while ago.

279
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,831
See? My deduction was right!

280
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,431
So, she's still inside?

281
00:14:56,432 --> 00:15:00,231
No. She left here about 10 minutes ago.

282
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,531
-She left? -We just missed her.

283
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:06,531
Maybe she went out to look for you Aya because you weren't here.

284
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,931
Do you remember how did granny look?

285
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,531
Right when she came,

286
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:13,731
she was looking up at the window of the 2nd floor for a while.

287
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:17,931
And then she said to me "May I come in?", so I said "yes".

288
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,831
It doesn't sound like she came here to save Aya.

289
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,331
Then, what was it?

290
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:26,831
She left here 10 minutes ago, so she may be around here still!

291
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:28,731
Do you know which way she went?

292
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,131
Yes, she went that way.

293
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,531
I'll go and look for her!

294
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,631
Wait! We should go with her!

295
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,131
Yeah!

296
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,531
How did she look when she left here?

297
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:41,331
Actually, she looked as if she saw something unbelievable.

298
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,331
I talked to her but she didn't respond and just left.

299
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,332
Thank you!

300
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,331
Wait a sec.

301
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:53,531
Maybe there's some clue left in this house.

302
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:54,931
May I go in?

303
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,332
Sure.

304
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:59,132
"Music Room."

305
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:15,731
That's...

306
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,932
the old ward of Beika Hospital.

307
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:22,831
Her daughter loved classical music, especially Mozart.

308
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,232
Maybe...

309
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,531
Ayako, I'm sorry.

310
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,832
I'll be there soon.

311
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,632
It's no good!

312
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:53,732
Granny! Granny!

313
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:58,732
Darn!

314
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:06,031
Maybe Fumie is on her way home.

315
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,132
Yeah.

316
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,231
It's Shinichi!

317
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,631
-Hello? -Ran!

318
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,331
I got your message. Where are you right now?

319
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,531
I'm right in front of the Shitara Memorial House.

320
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:19,731
Okay, you need to ask Mrs. Shitara to play Mozart right now, got that?

321
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:21,031
Mozart?

322
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,331
-Yeah! You need to hurry! -I'll go!

323
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:24,531
Sonoko just went...

324
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:25,831
Okay, now I need to talk to Aya!

325
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,131
What?

326
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:28,631
It's Shinichi.

327
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,331
Excuse me. Hello, it's Aya.

328
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:36,131
Aya, Fumie is right now in front of the old ward of Beika Hospital!

329
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,231
Beika Hospital?

330
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:38,631
You need to go there!

331
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:41,332
Fumie is trying to kill herself!

332
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,032
You have to make it, please!

333
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:17,531
Aya, the Beika Hospital was where Fumie's daughter

334
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,731
was staying at before she died.

335
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,531
Perhaps, she heard Mozart

336
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:26,131
that Mr. Shitara was playing in his house.

337
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:29,431
And that melody was the only thing that could ease Ayako's mind.

338
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:32,031
Fumie used to see Shitara's residence from the window of the Ayako's ward.

339
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,632
And it was the same scene that she saw on the TV drama today.

340
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,131
Fumie was surprised and panicked.

341
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:42,131
So she got out of her house and headed to Beika-cho.

342
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,131
And there, she saw the old ward of Beika Hospital

343
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:47,431
from the Shitara Memorial House.

344
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:51,431
Perhaps, she couldn't believe what she actually saw there.

345
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:55,431
Because the hospital ward had been kept just like it used to be.

346
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,231
This way!

347
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:59,931
Fumie left the memorial house and headed to the old hospital.

348
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,631
As she stood in front of the old hospital ward,

349
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:06,631
the painful past of having lost her daughter came back to her.

350
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:10,031
She thinks that it was her fault that Ayako died.

351
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,732
And now, she is trying to die, to see her daughter in heaven.

352
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,031
There is only one person who can stop her.

353
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,631
Aya, it is you!

354
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,032
Only me?

355
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,432
Grandma!

356
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,832
Ayako?

357
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:37,331
There is only one person who can stop her.

358
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,232
Aya, it is you!

359
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:46,531
Mom, I lived only 17 years, but I was happy.

360
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,631
What?

361
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:52,131
I was really happy because you were my mom.

362
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,731
I just wanted to tell you that.

363
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,231
Ayako.

364
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:59,031
So, please don't die now, Mom.

365
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,532
You have to live for me, please.

366
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:04,731
Okay.

367
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:08,132
I will, Ayako. Thank you.

368
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,331
Grandma!

369
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:14,731
Aya?

370
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:17,131
Grandma.

371
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,031
Ayako came here to see me, just now.

372
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:24,931
She came and forgave me.

373
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,631
That's good, Grandma.

374
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:29,132
That's good.

375
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,132
Ran!

376
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,732
You found her.

377
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,031
Shinichi,

378
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:42,931
I think I fulfilled the promise that we made 4 years ago.

379
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:46,731
Yeah. I think I fulfilled my promise as well.

380
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:48,831
You are good at soccer.

381
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,531
You are gonna be a soccer player?

382
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,031
No, I will be a detective.

383
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,131
Detective?

384
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,031
Like Holmes.

385
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,731
You mean Sherlock Holmes?

386
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:59,331
Yeah, but a high school detective, before that.

387
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,931
It's not nothing like childish play.

388
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,732
A real detective's what I'm gonna be.

389
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,531
Do you wanna make a promise?

390
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,331
Next time we see each other, maybe 4 or 5 years later.

391
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,631
I will be a real actress,

392
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,232
and you will be a real detective.

393
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,331
Yeah, sure thing.

394
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:22,131
Anyway, how did you grasp the situation only by the text message?

395
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:24,131
Well, deduction is about formula.

396
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:27,332
I get the answer as long as I applied the right formula.

397
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:29,631
All right, take care.

398
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,632
Yeah, you too.

399
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,531
Ran!

400
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:36,831
Conan!

401
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,631
No wonder it took forever to find you guys!

402
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,031
Hey, you found the granny.

403
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:44,032
Kid, what are you doing there?

404
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,831
You can't come up here, can you?

405
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:48,432
It's so funny.

406
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:51,431
You!

407
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,131
Ran, Sonoko, thank you.

408
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:55,931
And you too, Conan. Thank you!

409
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:57,931
You're welcome!

410
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:00,131
Now, Grandma, shall we go home?

411
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:01,132
Okay.

412
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:02,231
Here.

413
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:04,231
Come and see us anytime.

414
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,232
Yes.

415
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,531
-Good bye. -Good bye.

416
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,431
Conan! Take care!

417
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,232
Bye-bye!

418
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:14,232
It was fantastic acting!

419
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,931
So the case ended happily.

420
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:45,032
But ever since that day...

421
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,331
God, not again.

422
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:53,231
What was that promise you guys made 4 years ago? Tell me, Shinichi!

423
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:57,032
There will be no call to Ran for a while.

424
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:01,331
"Next Episode."

425
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:06,131
Which means his father is not near him?

426
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,132
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

427
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:08,132
"How lucky the fish are."

428
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,331
I wonder what in the world happened.

429
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,631
I don't understand the fourth mail though.

430
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:17,332
Die like a fish caught in fishing net?

431
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:28,732
Next Conan, "Pursue the Fish Mail".

432
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:46,931
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,231
"Three fish."

434
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:50,931
What's the best part of this year's movie episode?

435
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:52,431
My swimsuit scene!

436
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:53,932
Was there such scene in it?
