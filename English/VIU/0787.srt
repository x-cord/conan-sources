1
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,888
Can this boy called Conan Edogawa...

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:08,589
really be trusted?

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,988
He does seem to be a bit sharp, though.

4
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,389
Don't worry.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,388
And? When is this boy coming here?

6
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,488
The promised time is...

7
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,488
It's about time.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,488
I hope you made sure that he'd come alone?

9
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,489
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,089
I made sure that he wouldn't bring the children along.

11
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,588
There he is, he's come.

12
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:34,989
Make sure to carry things out with great care.

13
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,288
If they're people who aren't worth it,

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,588
we're getting out of here

15
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:45,188
and gotta find a new base to operate from.

16
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,088
Yeah, I know.

17
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,389
Go hide in the bathroom until you're convinced.

18
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,089
Yes, coming.

19
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,788
I have been waiting for you, Conan.

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,588
Yahoo!

21
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,389
We came along, too.

22
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:05,788
You... you didn't come alone?

23
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,388
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,688
When I told them that you told me

25
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,388
there's a pool in this hotel,

26
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,688
they insisted on coming along.

27
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,888
Weren't we supposed to come?

28
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,288
Oh, no.

29
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,788
It's just that I was a bit surprised

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,589
because I didn't know you were coming.

31
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:27,488
Okay, then. You guys go on ahead to the pool.

32
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,388
I'll get ready and be right over.

33
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,789
-Okay. -Okay.

34
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:41,688
Sorry.

35
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,089
You idiot.

36
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:50,488
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard

37
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,888
and move forward full speed without slowing down.

38
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,688
Shattered pieces of glass in the pool.

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,588
A strange sound to a blind case.

40
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,188
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,988
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,189
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:46,662
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 1)"

44
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:01,961
How spacious.

45
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:06,261
Well, it's maybe a bit smaller than the pool at my villa though.

46
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,861
I mean, how big is your villa anyway?

47
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:12,061
I can't wait to see Ms. Sera's swimsuit.

48
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,961
I wonder what kind of swimsuit it'll be.

49
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,761
Well...

50
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:18,061
A sporty one-piece swimsuit maybe?

51
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,962
You're looking forward to it too, aren't you, Conan?

52
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,061
Oh, yes.

53
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:28,061
As far as I'm concerned I'm more than satisfied already, though.

54
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:31,261
Well, but Sera's got a flat chest.

55
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,561
Sera?

56
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:35,561
Well, she looks like a cute younger sister, doesn't she?

57
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,861
I guess so.

58
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,862
I'm fine with "Sera".

59
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:45,661
I was called that when I was little, too.

60
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,061
Stripe bikini.

61
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:50,261
You don't have chest,

62
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:51,861
but you've got guts.

63
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,261
Guts?

64
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,062
Huh? Lady Sonoko?

65
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,262
Long time no see.

66
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,161
Do I know you?

67
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:05,161
"Raito Samaki (30)" -I'm Samaki, secretary for President Oiso.

68
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:08,461
Oh, right. Maybe I met you at a party several times?

69
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:10,561
You remember me.

70
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,961
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,162
Samaki!

72
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,561
Will you come over here a minute, Samaki?

73
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,062
Yes, right now.

74
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,561
Who's that girl?

75
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:24,561
She's the daughter of President Oiso that was just mentioned.

76
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:26,761
Lady Nagami Oiso.

77
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:28,462
"Nagami Oiso (31), President's Daughter."

78
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,161
Oiso? Do you mean Oiso Finance?

79
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,061
Yes. They're a subsidiary

80
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,061
of our affiliate company.

81
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,961
Yeah...

82
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:40,962
What is it?

83
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,761
Will you put oil on for me?

84
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:46,161
I let her do it for me, and she scratches me with her nails.

85
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,261
I... I'm sorry.

86
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,262
Then, who's the one that's obsequiously bowing?

87
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:55,361
I think she's Nagami's younger sister.

88
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:57,261
"Hamaka Oiso (28), Nagami's half-sister" -Lady Hamaka.

89
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,261
Her younger sister.

90
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:02,961
She's acting too obsequiously to be her younger sister.

91
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,061
You can say that again.

92
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,361
I heard that she's the daughter of the president's mistress.

93
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,561
Since her mother died of an illness.

94
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:11,761
It seems she had no other choice but to stay at the Oiso residence.

95
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,461
And the one behind her younger sister

96
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:17,061
is the hired manager of this hotel.

97
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,461
"Ensaku Toyoshima (56)" -I think his was called Mr. Toyoshima.

98
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,961
"Hotel Manager" -The owner of this hotel is President Oiso.

99
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:26,762
I guess he's showing people around the pool that's just been renovated.

100
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:33,061
You're good. I like it.

101
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,961
You sure do it differently from the one who was doing it before you.

102
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,061
I'm not used to doing things like this.

103
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:42,461
Well, I guess it comes as no surprise that you're good.

104
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:46,362
I guess you're rubbing oil all over for her, too.

105
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:48,961
Just what do you mean by that?

106
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:53,561
I've known for some time that you two were on intimate terms.

107
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,561
And that you both eventually plan

108
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:59,461
to get a hold of half of my father's inheritance.

109
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,962
No, we don't.

110
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:06,461
Lady Nagami, I think you're over thinking things.

111
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,861
Shut up!

112
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,961
I know that you're letting the two

113
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,461
use this hotel for their rendezvous.

114
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:15,961
I hope you haven't forgotten

115
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:18,461
that you're my fiance.

116
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:19,462
What?

117
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:24,461
I'm going to talk to father about.

118
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:25,561
Nagami...

119
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,761
I don't want to hear excuses.

120
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:31,562
No, the necklace that you were wearing...

121
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,661
No...

122
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,961
You were swimming just now.

123
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:39,561
Could it be in the pool?

124
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:43,561
Hey! No, just how much do you think it cost?

125
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,561
Get the guests out of the pool right this minute

126
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:46,961
and close this place off.

127
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,061
-What? -What?

128
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,161
Don't forget to check the belongings of the guests, too.

129
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:53,761
Somebody could've secretly taken it, you see.

130
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,261
But...

131
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,961
Raito, you bring the snorkels.

132
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,661
What? You mean you're going to look for it yourself?

133
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:03,761
Maybe it'll be better to drain the water of the pool, then.

134
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:04,861
Stupid.

135
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:09,362
What if it goes out the drain together with the water?

136
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,061
At any rate, get the guests out of here and look for it!

137
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,062
Understand?

138
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:28,062
No good.

139
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:30,261
Snorkeling won't do.

140
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:33,461
Samaki, get me the oxygen tank for diving.

141
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,761
Okay.

142
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:37,061
I thought that you'd say,

143
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,061
so I already brought it here.

144
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:40,661
And you.

145
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,961
You're getting in the way of the search, so will you get out of the pool.

146
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,461
But, Lady Nagami,

147
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:50,061
I think it's faster if we all look for it together.

148
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,561
Enough. Shut up.

149
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,761
Oh, you're getting on my nerves!

150
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:57,862
I'll look for it myself, so all of you get out of the pool!

151
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:11,862
Gosh, I wonder if all rich girls are selfish like her?

152
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,962
Sonoko's not like that, right?

153
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,661
Well, I guess not.

154
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,762
"Lunch menu: Burgundy-style Curry Stew" -Thank you very much.

155
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,061
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:27,061
You guys wanted to have fun at the pool

157
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,761
and yet to have something like that happen.

158
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:31,061
It's not your fault, Ms. Sera.

159
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,261
It's Sera. Sera.

160
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:36,661
Well, I guess at least the hotel lunch was good so all is well.

161
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,762
I guess so.

162
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,461
Is something wrong, Conan?

163
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,961
Yes. The bellboys of the hotel

164
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,262
have been moving around busily from a while ago.

165
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,062
I wonder if something happened?

166
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,261
What?

167
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,761
Lady Nagami...

168
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,561
Disappeared?

169
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:01,261
Wasn't she looking for her necklace in the pool?

170
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,261
She was supposed to be,

171
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,661
but she suddenly disappeared.

172
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:09,461
I looked for her in the restroom and changing room near the pool, too.

173
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,762
It doesn't seem she went home either.

174
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,361
Hey, look!

175
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:20,761
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

176
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:22,061
What?

177
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,061
Isn't... isn't that...

178
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:25,262
a person?

179
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,861
Lady...

180
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,862
Nagami?

181
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,244
Hey, look!

182
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,644
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

183
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,044
What?

184
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,044
Isn't... isn't that...

185
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,245
a person?

186
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,844
Lady...

187
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,445
Nagami?

188
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,644
No way!

189
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:08,645
How could that be?

190
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,344
Nagami?

191
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,144
Hurry, call the ambulance and the police!

192
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,444
-Yes! -Yes.

193
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,645
Nagami?

194
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,644
Nagami?

195
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,444
Get a hold of yourself.

196
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,744
Nagami?

197
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:30,745
Nagami!

198
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,844
Nagami!

199
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,144
But it's odd.

200
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,544
There was nothing in the pool

201
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,944
when we looked ten minutes ago.

202
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,145
You're right.

203
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,145
That hurts!

204
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,345
What... what is it?

205
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,945
Shattered pieces of glass at the bottom of the pool.

206
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:01,144
Shattered pieces...

207
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,645
Glass?

208
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,644
Drowned?

209
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,644
Yes. According to the report of the forensic officer,

210
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:16,145
the ETD was between 12:00 to 13:00.

211
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,644
But I don't get it.

212
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:23,144
This pool isn't that deep that your feet don't touch the bottom, is it?

213
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:25,544
Yet, why'd she drown?

214
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,744
On top of carrying the oxygen tank,

215
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,544
she wearing weights around her hips,

216
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,944
so that she wouldn't come floating up.

217
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:35,344
Lady Nagami said that she wanted to concentrate on

218
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,444
searching the bottom of the pool.

219
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:38,844
Lady?

220
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,144
The victim is...

221
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:45,344
the daughter of the President of Oiso Finance, Nagami Oiso.

222
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:47,344
The daughter of a president?

223
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:51,044
And? What was she looking for at the bottom of the pool?

224
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:54,444
She was looking for her necklace.

225
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:58,744
We noticed that it was missing when I was rubbing suntan oil on her.

226
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:02,944
We figured she may have dropped it in the pool when she was swimming.

227
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:06,644
After we asked the guests to leave the pool.

228
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,244
The four of us, including Lady Nagami,

229
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,044
checked the restroom and the changing room

230
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:13,745
and inside the pool.

231
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:18,544
Nagami said that she wanted to look for it alone.

232
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,345
So, we did as we were told...

233
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,245
but she ended up like this.

234
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,144
I see.

235
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,944
If so, this could've been an accident.

236
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,144
Yes.

237
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:34,744
It's probable that an accident like leg cramps caused her to panic,

238
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:39,644
on top of the fact that she was wearing heavy weights.

239
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:44,544
Then if the mouthpiece she used to breathe in air came off,

240
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,845
she could've drowned.

241
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,544
I don't think so.

242
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:50,644
-What? -What?

243
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:56,044
They said there was nothing in the pool ten minutes

244
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,544
before she was found.

245
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,544
Right, sir?

246
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:02,244
Oh, yeah.

247
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,944
Is that true?

248
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,344
Oh, yes.

249
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,444
The manager and two others plus both of us

250
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:12,244
came to this pool to look for Lady Nagami.

251
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,344
But we couldn't find her.

252
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:17,644
And when we came to look for her again ten minutes later.

253
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:20,444
Lady Nagami was sunk at the bottom of the pool.

254
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,244
Do you know about what time it was?

255
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:27,144
I think it was a little after two in the afternoon.

256
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,644
Hey, I thought you said that the ETD

257
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:33,144
was between 12:00 to 13:00?

258
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:34,344
Yes.

259
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:38,244
If so, after drowning Nagami between 12:00 to 13:00,

260
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,744
somebody hid her corpse somewhere.

261
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:45,244
And at about 14:00 without being seen by anyone,

262
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:48,444
brought her to the center of the pool and sunk her.

263
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,844
Right?

264
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:54,944
Was it possible for someone to have done that unnoticed?

265
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:58,644
No. All of us spilt up to go look for her.

266
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:03,644
So I think it wouldn't have been possible to not be noticed by us.

267
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:06,744
Besides, at the entrance of this pool,

268
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,044
the receptionists at the counter

269
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:12,144
are checking who goes in and out.

270
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,145
I don't think they'd let anyone suspicious through.

271
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,944
But...

272
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:22,044
it seems that something strange was at the bottom of the pool too.

273
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,644
Something strange?

274
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:26,244
There were a lot of shattered pieces of glass at the bottom of the pool,

275
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,644
you stepped on it

276
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,444
and hurt the sole of your feet, right, manager?

277
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,644
Yeah.

278
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,744
Is... is that true?

279
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,244
Oh, yes.

280
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:39,044
I carried Lady Nagami's oxygen tank

281
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:42,144
to the pool side,

282
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:45,544
but when I was about to come out of the water with it.

283
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,745
That hurts!

284
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:51,144
I felt a surge of pain on the sole of my foot,

285
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,844
and dove in to look.

286
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:56,944
A lot of shattered glass was at the bottom of the pool.

287
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,944
What... what did you say?

288
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,144
Drain the water of the pool immediately.

289
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,344
We'll talk after that.

290
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,745
Yes, sir!

291
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:13,644
These do look to be shattered pieces of glass.

292
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,645
But why are there so many?

293
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:21,344
Were these here when you were searching the pool with Ms. Nagami?

294
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:22,444
No.

295
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,844
There weren't any.

296
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,844
If there were, we'd notice.

297
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:29,244
But with so much shattered,

298
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,344
we'd have to put them back together

299
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:32,744
to find out what it originally was.

300
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,344
True.

301
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,344
-It's an aquarium. -It's an aquarium.

302
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,644
An aquarium?

303
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:41,344
You see, the piece that you're holding now

304
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,944
looks like the corner of a box.

305
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:47,144
And the L-shaped piece that Inspector Megure is holding.

306
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,945
There are four each of them, right?

307
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,144
True.

308
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,944
There are four each.

309
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:59,244
If you assemble them in your head,

310
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,844
you get something that looks like an aquarium, right?

311
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,144
I see.

312
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:08,244
This is making less and less sense.

313
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:10,944
Why would an aquarium be at the bottom of the pool

314
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,644
and much less shattered to pieces?

315
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:14,845
Inspector Megure.

316
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:19,644
We found a long fishing line stuck in the drain of the pool.

317
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:20,744
A fishing line?

318
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,744
Yes. I think it's about fifty meters.

319
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:25,845
Why would such a thing be there?

320
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:30,644
Ms. Hamaka!

321
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:34,144
What kind of necklace did Ms. Nagami lose?

322
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:37,145
A necklace with a lot of diamonds on it.

323
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:42,544
If so, the perp probably by using the pieces of glass

324
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,344
and the fishing line tried making a fake version of the necklace

325
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,444
in order to do something.

326
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:51,144
I think the fishing line is much too long for something like that.

327
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,444
What if you make a loop at the end of the line

328
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,444
and put the pieces of glass on it.

329
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:00,444
Then, pull it through the water in order to lure Ms. Nagami?

330
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,144
I... I guess if so it's probable.

331
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:07,044
Then, please continue searching inside the pool.

332
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,144
Yes, sir.

333
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:12,144
In the meantime, let's ask for the details.

334
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:15,944
The sequence of events that lead to the search of the necklace.

335
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:19,745
Let's ask those three that have a connection with Ms. Nagami.

336
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,444
All three of you...

337
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:27,944
put oil on Ms. Nagami?

338
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:33,044
Yes. But she said that I wasn't good at it and turned me down.

339
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,744
Enough already. You're terrible.

340
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:40,644
I seem to have scratched her with my nails and gotten her angry.

341
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,844
That hurts. What's with you scratching me?

342
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:46,344
I'm the last one who put oil on her.

343
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,044
But after she found out that she lost her necklace,

344
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,044
the rubbing oil bit was dropped.

345
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,744
Nagami.

346
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:54,945
The necklace that you were wearing...

347
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:57,944
No...

348
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,344
You were swimming just now.

349
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,844
Could it be in the pool?

350
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:06,844
Hey! No, just how much do you think it cost?

351
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,744
Get the guests out of the pool right this minute

352
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,344
and close this place off.

353
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:11,345
-What? -What?

354
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:15,344
I thought it would be possible to take off her necklace

355
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,244
while rubbing suntan oil on her.

356
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,044
We had no idea that she made all three of you put suntan oil on her.

357
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:25,744
She favored doing things like that.

358
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,344
-What? -What?

359
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:31,744
She would make men zip her clothes up.

360
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,244
Or make them check her temperature

361
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,744
by having them place their hands on her forehead.

362
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:39,144
It was cute the way she enjoyed

363
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,144
watching people's reactions.

364
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,044
Cute?

365
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,344
She's the type that girls don't like.

366
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:47,044
Are girls like that?

367
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,344
But you're a girl too, aren't you, Ms. Sera?

368
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:51,444
It's Sera. Sera.

369
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:53,144
Oh, right.

370
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:57,644
Of course, I knew that she would say she'd go and look for it alone.

371
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,544
Because she was picky about everything.

372
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:03,744
Well, I accepted that part of her thinking

373
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,944
that it was her individuality though.

374
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,444
I see.

375
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:11,644
But Ms. Nagami mentioned, didn't she?

376
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,144
That Mr. Samaki, her fiance,

377
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:16,645
had something going with you, her younger sister.

378
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:21,944
I've known for some time that you two were on intimate terms.

379
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,944
And that you both eventually plan

380
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:28,244
to get a hold of half of my father's inheritance.

381
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,744
She also said that the manager offered them

382
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,744
to use the hotel room for their rendezvous.

383
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,044
Shut up!

384
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:36,244
I know that you're letting the two

385
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:39,145
use this hotel for their rendezvous.

386
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:44,244
If that's true, it can be a motive for murder.

387
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,644
You've got me wrong.

388
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,745
Nagami just over thought things.

389
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:52,644
The thing is her birthday was coming up.

390
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:55,544
We were discussing celebrating her birthday

391
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,044
in the suite room of this hotel that she favored.

392
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,944
We talked of the decorations and food.

393
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:04,344
Of course, it was to be a surprise party,

394
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:07,344
so it was kept a secret from Lady Nagami.

395
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:10,744
We were discussing this in that room,

396
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:14,144
so Nagami probably misunderstood.

397
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:17,944
She's always been the jealous type.

398
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,444
Always?

399
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,244
Yes. I used to be classmates with her in high school.

400
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:25,445
I used to go with her since then.

401
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:31,144
Well, Lady Nagami really liked that room,

402
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,445
so it's no surprise that she would get upset.

403
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:35,744
She liked it that much?

404
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:39,344
Yes. I hear she kicked a guest who had reservation out of the room

405
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,344
in order to spend a night there.

406
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:46,044
So, we have no motive to want to kill her!

407
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,144
We were trying to celebrate her birthday!

408
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:52,944
If you still suspect us, you can ask the other staff of the hotel.

409
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:57,744
We talked of the decorations and other stuff with the staff too.

410
00:21:57,745 --> 00:22:00,944
We'll be confirming that later.

411
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,944
First of all, we'd like you to tell us

412
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:07,845
what you've been doing after Ms. Nagami started searching alone.

413
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:46,344
"Next Episode" -This is an impossible crime!

414
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:47,944
Right, Takagi?

415
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:49,744
Where's Officer Takagi?

416
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,444
Officer Takagi's here.

417
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:53,745
In the pool.

418
00:23:56,545 --> 00:24:01,445
After the perp drowned Ms. Nagami who was searching for necklace alone...

419
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:04,244
It disappeared...

420
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,445
Just like Conan did a while ago.

421
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,244
Next Conan,

422
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:13,045
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 2)"
