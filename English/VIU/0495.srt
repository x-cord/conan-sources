1
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,533
And? How was it?

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:06,633
Huh?

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:10,533
You know, the connection between that boy Eisuke and Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:13,133
Judging from their blood type,

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,433
it seems that Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,733
are two different people.

7
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,533
According to the parent child booklet, Eisuke is blood type O!

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,533
In other words, his older sister who gave him blood

9
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,433
has to be blood type O.

10
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:25,533
And Rena Mizunashi

11
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,433
who's in the hospital now is blood type AB!

12
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:33,433
So, Rena Mizunashi and that boy were not siblings after all?

13
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,733
No.

14
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,333
Most probably not.

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,533
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

16
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,133
Cut out that scary look of yours.

17
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,833
I'll tell you about it as soon as I find out what's going on.

18
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,433
I'm sorry, I happened to be born with this scary face.

19
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,633
See you.

20
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,233
Oh. Huh?

21
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,733
"Mouri Detective Agency"

22
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,233
I'm home!

23
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:08,933
Well, Yoko's song is fantastic any day.

24
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,533
It's beautiful like the twittering of birds.

25
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,033
Darn, those crows, on the third floor railing again.

26
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,833
Hey, shut up, you guys!

27
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,333
Get out of here, you darn crows!

28
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:34,533
I mean, "gee little crows, what makes you cry?"

29
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,333
Sizzling hot suspense.

30
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,233
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

31
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,133
From Rena Mizunashi to the Black Organization!

32
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,333
Join hands with the FBI and with great cooperation,

33
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,533
corner those guys.

34
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,033
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,633
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:12,033
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:42,807
"Red and Black Crash: Coma."

38
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,524
Huh? No. It's stopped at Eisuke again?

39
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:50,024
Yeah! I can't get through no matter how many times I try calling.

40
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,924
I'm home!

41
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:53,024
Hi, Conan.

42
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,624
Hey, Ran! Are you listening?

43
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,924
Is something wrong with Eisuke?

44
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,524
Yep, we can't get hold of him

45
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:02,424
and the message network is stalled again.

46
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,924
We want to let him know that the school event

47
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,624
that was scheduled to be held after the holidays, is cancelled.

48
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:11,624
Again? Since when can't you get a hold of Eisuke?

49
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:15,024
Right after winter vacation started. I think.

50
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:18,824
Sonoko said that the message network stopped back then at Eisuke too.

51
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:24,224
Oh, didn't Eisuke mention anything before winter vacation started?

52
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,624
Oh, I think he did.

53
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,124
About a clue.

54
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:31,524
He mentioned something about finding a clue.

55
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:33,224
At Haido Central Hospital!

56
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,024
What?

57
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,924
Haido Central Hospital?

58
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:41,024
Rena Mizunashi is there.

59
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:45,724
The woman named Kir who's one of the guys in black is there.

60
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,824
But, how could he have found out?

61
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,824
The FBI agents should be there tightly hiding her

62
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:53,124
and guarding the place so that her whereabouts wouldn't be disclosed.

63
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,524
It's not all that easy to find her.

64
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,924
Conan?

65
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,624
Conan!

66
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,724
Listen to me.

67
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:04,124
He found a clue, but it wasn't about his older sister.

68
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,124
Huh?

69
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,224
Then, what was it about?

70
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,824
His father!

71
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,224
He said he found a colleague of his father

72
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:14,424
who used to work at the same company as his father!

73
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:16,924
Eisuke looked really happy!

74
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:17,924
He said that he thinks that

75
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,924
his father whose whereabouts became unknown long ago,

76
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:23,624
was looking for his colleague and older sister.

77
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,524
His father's colleague?

78
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,824
You mean one of the members of the Company?

79
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:31,224
Don't tell me that people, other than the guys in black

80
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:33,524
are also looking for Rena Mizunashi.

81
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,724
But, it was after that,

82
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,524
that we couldn't get a hold of Eisuke.

83
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,924
It could be that he's been looking for his older sister together

84
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,524
with that person from the company since winter vacation too.

85
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:51,624
I'm sorry that I had to ask you to come out all this way, Jodie.

86
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:52,924
No problem!

87
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:55,624
Calling from the hospital is too dangerous

88
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,924
and besides I wanted to talk to you too.

89
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,824
And, what is this troublesome thing that occurred?

90
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,624
It's Eisuke Hondo!

91
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,324
He went to Haido Central Hospital!

92
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,924
Oh, you mean the boy that's searching for his older sister

93
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:11,024
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi?

94
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:14,224
It's true that he came to the hospital at the end of the year, but...

95
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,124
-Really? -Yes.

96
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,524
He seemed to be asking around at the nurses

97
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,724
with the picture of his older sister in hand, but...

98
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:23,824
He probably got no information and went home

99
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,824
because they knew nothing about Rena Mizunashi.

100
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:29,824
No, it's not about his older sister,

101
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:30,824
but, rather, he's saying that

102
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,924
he saw his father's colleague at the hospital!

103
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,724
His father's?

104
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,824
You mean, don't tell me it's has to do with the Company?

105
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:41,724
Yeah, there's a possibility that they're looking for Rena Mizunashi too,

106
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:44,024
although I don't really know what their purpose is yet.

107
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:47,324
It sure is troublesome if what you're saying is true.

108
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:52,224
If it's the Company, then they may know the faces of us FBI agents.

109
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,324
After all, anything's okay with them when they want to get their way,

110
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,424
so it's most likely that they'll get rough

111
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,024
even inside a hospital.

112
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:01,124
It's only natural that the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

113
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:03,424
will be known to them too!

114
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,624
I hope all they did was stop over at Haido Central Hospital.

115
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:09,224
If they're already hiding some place in the hospital,

116
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:11,424
we've got to think of something fast.

117
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:14,924
It's been bothering me for some time now

118
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:17,424
but what on earth is the company?

119
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:18,624
From your conversation,

120
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:21,224
it doesn't seem like the usual kind of company.

121
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:25,224
FBI is called the bureau office, that is, likewise.

122
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:27,724
I think that the Company is probably a vernacular name.

123
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,424
It's the organization working under the direct order of the President,

124
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:33,724
that gathers information to cope with and execute national affairs

125
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:36,124
having to do with the United States, including foreign affairs.

126
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,224
In other words, you mean...

127
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,724
The CIA.

128
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,724
CIA?

129
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:47,524
In other words, Eisuke's father was a spy for the U.S,

130
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:48,824
isn't that it?

131
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:51,924
Not really. It's only a possibility.

132
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:55,424
No, I'm sure he was.

133
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:56,524
You'd better be grateful

134
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:59,924
because I searched high and low and grabbed this info.

135
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,224
Which means...

136
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:04,024
His real name is Ethern Hondo.

137
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,024
He's a 2nd generation Japanese American,

138
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:09,524
who entered the CIA 30 years ago as an agent.

139
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,324
He immigrated to Japan three years after becoming an agent,

140
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,324
got married and stayed in Japan.

141
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:18,024
I don't know what he was looking into

142
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,624
but, it's most likely...

143
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,024
Information on the Men in Black.

144
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,624
Yes. If we were to believe the story

145
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:27,924
that the CIA is after Rena Mizunashi,

146
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,424
I'm sure there's no doubt.

147
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,224
But isn't it strange?

148
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:32,524
I would think that if Eisuke

149
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,324
were looking for Rena Mizunashi who is one of them,

150
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:37,724
that underwent surgery to look just like Eisuke's older sister,

151
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,424
the CIA would try to stop him.

152
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:44,224
True, the organization is probably looking for her whereabouts too,

153
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,924
so if it should become conspicuous, danger is inevitable,

154
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:48,824
and there's a possibility that it would also hinder CIA activities.

155
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,724
Above all, if Eisuke is the real son of an agent,

156
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,524
I'm sure they would stop him.

157
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:58,424
No, Eisuke Hondo did stop looking for Rena Mizunashi!

158
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:00,124
This winter vacation

159
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,524
after he said he found a colleague of his father

160
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:04,824
at Haido Central Hospital,

161
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,924
no one's been able to contact him.

162
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:09,324
Which means that the boy was abducted by the CIA...

163
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:12,324
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have him in their custody,

164
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:15,424
thanks to his worried father's request.

165
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,324
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

166
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,024
Because that boy's father Ethern Hondo

167
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:24,624
passed away four years ago.

168
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,824
The place was an unused warehouse in Yokohama.

169
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:35,824
The eye-witness was a homeless who was using the place as his lodgings.

170
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:41,824
He awoke with the sound of gun fire and looked below.

171
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:45,024
He saw a woman crouched over a man who had collapsed on the ground,

172
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,724
and then saw two other men come along.

173
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:49,624
They were both dressed in black.

174
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,824
One was tall with long hair

175
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,124
and the other was a stout man wearing sunglasses.

176
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:58,124
Gin and Vodka!

177
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,624
The woman who was crouched over

178
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:03,524
explained as she gasped to the two men dressed in black.

179
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:07,224
She grabbed the man's wrist and took his gun away.

180
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,024
Then shot him.

181
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,824
She then told them, "I didn't say a word."

182
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,824
"Proof that I didn't, is in the MD that the dead man is holding."

183
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,824
After a while, another man appeared

184
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,124
ran over to him and shouted.

185
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:31,624
Hondo!

186
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:35,324
Then the man who ran over to him was also a CIA agent?

187
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,424
But, just because the man shouted his last name,

188
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,524
it's not proof that the man was Ethern Hondo, is it?

189
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:42,924
The picture of Eisuke's father that you sent me.

190
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,424
I showed it to him and confirmed,

191
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,924
the man said he was sure it was him.

192
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,024
The man?

193
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,424
Mr. Akai.

194
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,824
In fact, he's the one

195
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:54,124
who found out that Ethern Hondo was a CIA agent.

196
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,824
I don't know how he does it,

197
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:00,424
but the evidence he brings together is never wrong.

198
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,924
I wonder if the organization would leave

199
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,724
two eye-witnesses just like that, without doing anything?

200
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:09,024
Fortunately, it seems they weren't aware that the homeless was watching.

201
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:13,224
But, the man who ran over, was shot by the guys who were hiding

202
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,224
and the warehouse was burned down to nothing in one night.

203
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,724
I'm sure that they thought no one could make it out alive from there,

204
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,824
like back when it happened to me.

205
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,824
I was more surprised of the "woman"

206
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:25,124
who was said to be at the scene!

207
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:31,024
That homeless was shaking but he finally answered me,

208
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,224
saying that the woman who was crouched over

209
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:37,524
looked just like Rena Mizunashi.

210
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,824
Which means...

211
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,824
Rena Mizunashi is...

212
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:44,324
Right, she couldn't be Eisuke's older sister.

213
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:45,324
Because then it would be that

214
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:49,924
the man's real daughter shot him to death.

215
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,424
It could be that

216
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:55,024
the woman approached Ethern Hondo pretending to be his daughter,

217
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:58,824
in order to figure out how much information the CIA had on them,

218
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:00,224
but he saw through her and caught her.

219
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:04,224
So, she killed him instead before he had a chance to interrogate her?

220
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,624
I guess I'm stuck now.

221
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:11,224
I came here

222
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,524
wanting to ask the boy Eisuke more about his father,

223
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,624
and I was hoping that you could ask him to come.

224
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,824
I had no idea that you wouldn't able to contact him.

225
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,224
At any rate, let's hurry to Haido Central Hospital!

226
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,324
Huh? You're going too?

227
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,724
Yep.

228
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:26,224
If the people of the CIA may be hiding there,

229
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,624
I think that I would be of more use to you,

230
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,124
because they don't know what I look like, right?

231
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,790
Yes, right!

232
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,290
We'll be there in ten minutes. Bye.

233
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,390
I have the nurse that Eisuke showed the picture to waiting here,

234
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,290
just like you told me to, boss.

235
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,790
Thank you.

236
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,790
Hey, I thought I was your boss?

237
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,090
Oh, did you say something, driver?

238
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,190
Doesn't it bother you, though?

239
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,490
Why did that boy Eisuke disappear?

240
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,890
Yes, so first we get in contact with the nurse who talked to him,

241
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,490
and find a clue.

242
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,390
But, well, I think that the CIA has him in custody.

243
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,290
His father may have passed away,

244
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,890
but I'm pretty sure that there's someone among them

245
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,990
who knows what his son looks like.

246
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,190
No, but all Eisuke Hondo said was that

247
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,190
he saw one of his father's colleagues at the hospital.

248
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,890
Huh? Wait a sec.

249
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,790
When we were talking about the time Eisuke Hondo's father

250
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,090
took him to the Okonomiyaki shop when he was small.

251
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,590
Oh, isn't this the one?

252
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,890
Right, it's this picture!

253
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,790
Right, it was the shop his father brought the members of the CIA to.

254
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,290
But...

255
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,890
Come to think of it, whenever he brought his son with him,

256
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,090
there were always only the two of them.

257
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,090
Which means, he couldn't have known any of the faces of the men.

258
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,090
If his father never let him meet any of the members,

259
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,590
why'd he say, he saw one of the members at the hospital?

260
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,290
No, wrong!

261
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,790
Come to think of it, he did say he found a clue.

262
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,090
According to Ran, he said he found a clue,

263
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,490
not saw somebody.

264
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,490
It may not have been that he saw someone.

265
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,790
If so, I wonder what he meant by.

266
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,490
"A clue to a colleague of his father at the Company" means?

267
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,190
Hold it, if what his father said at the Okonomiyaki shop

268
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,290
means, the time to dive into the Black Organization has come.

269
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,990
Is something the matter?

270
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,890
Yep, that's what Eisuke said.

271
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,490
That he found one of his father's colleagues

272
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,990
that worked for the Company.

273
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,490
You mean, he "saw" that person?

274
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,490
Nope.

275
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,190
He said that a person at Haido Central Hospital

276
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,890
was keying in the same number as the mail address

277
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,190
that his father used to key in

278
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,890
when he sent e-mails to his colleague at the Company.

279
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,690
Person at the Company?

280
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,990
If he didn't see the person yet, how did he know the e-mail address?

281
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,290
-The sound. -Sound?

282
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,190
It seems that his father used to call him at times

283
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,290
when he was on business abroad,

284
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,990
he used to hear the address being keyed in on the phone.

285
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,090
He said it sounded a lot like a melody.

286
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,190
Melody?

287
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,390
Oh, right, I'm sure it was the children's song.

288
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,990
Seven Baby Crows!

289
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,490
-What was that sound just now? -When he asked his father,

290
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,390
he was told that his father was sending out an e-mail

291
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,390
to a colleague at the Company!

292
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,190
Which means what Eisuke saw at Haido Central Hospital was...

293
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,690
The guys that may be hiding in the hospital

294
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,190
are not CIA agents,

295
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,090
but rather, the members of the Black Organization!

296
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,290
"Haido Central Hospital."

297
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,390
Oh, the members of that Organization are here at this hospital.

298
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,090
Yes, that's right!

299
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,990
But, it's still just a possibility.

300
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,090
It could be that they just dropped by.

301
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,690
Is that tip off, something you can trust?

302
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,590
It came from Conan Edogawa.

303
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,890
He says that one of his acquaintances saw a person

304
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,690
sending e-mail from the Haido Central Hospital

305
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,690
to the boss of the Organization.

306
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,790
That boy again.

307
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,590
You're really enthusiastic, aren't you, Jodie?

308
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,390
At any rate, the nurse that was contacted by the boy

309
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,990
is waiting at the hospital,

310
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,490
so tell the investigators to stay inconspicuous until we arrive.

311
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,890
If they find out that we, the FBI

312
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,490
are sheltering Rena Mizunashi at the hospital,

313
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,490
the only string that may connect us to the Organization may be severed.

314
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,890
Roger.

315
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,190
The only string?

316
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,990
But, just lowering a string into the dark depth of the sea,

317
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,790
will bear no fruit.

318
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,590
In order to fish them out,

319
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,590
we need bait that will lure them out deep into our pockets and...

320
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,590
and a needle that will poke deep into their throats.

321
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,990
Oh, this young man.

322
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,690
He came at the end of the year with the picture of a woman.

323
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,490
Was that the picture of the announcer Rena Mizunashi?

324
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,890
Yes,

325
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,290
he asked me if that person was hospitalized here but...

326
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,790
I told him she wasn't.

327
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,990
If she were, I'm sure that the rumor of her being here

328
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,690
would've spread throughout the hospital immediately.

329
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,190
So, he was looking for Rena Mizunashi

330
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,490
and not his older sister, after all?

331
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,090
But, is it really true that

332
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,090
this young man's whereabouts is unknown since he came here?

333
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,690
Rather, it's more like we can't get a hold of him.

334
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,490
That's why his teacher is also looking for him

335
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,490
together with the people living in the neighborhood.

336
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,890
And, besides, Rena Mizunashi is taking a long time off, right?

337
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,790
So, he suspected that maybe she was sick or something

338
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,190
and hospitalized.

339
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,390
I mean, he's a really great fan of Rena Mizunashi, you see,

340
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,990
I think he's been looking around for her

341
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,790
all through winter vacation without even going home,

342
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,590
but did he say anything else?

343
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,690
Oh. Come to think of it, back then.

344
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,990
Somebody asked me the same question you're asking me now!

345
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,490
The question was,

346
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,590
I saw a person who looked just like Rena Mizunashi in this hospital

347
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,390
but is it really her?

348
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,390
I was surprised!

349
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,090
What did that person look like?

350
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,090
Well... I couldn't see very well.

351
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,690
You couldn't see?

352
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,590
I dropped my contacts when someone bumped into me then.

353
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,290
And, that's when he called out to me.

354
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,590
The voice? What sort of voice was it?

355
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,890
I wonder. I know it was a man's voice,

356
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,690
but I can't say what kind of voice it was.

357
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,190
Oh, but I think

358
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,490
he was a patient who was hospitalized here at the end of the year.

359
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,290
Although blurred, I saw the person wearing the sandals

360
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,890
that the shop at the hospital newly purchased,

361
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,790
and put on sale just around that time.

362
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,090
What?

363
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,190
Since when were those sandals sold in the store?

364
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,290
If I remember correctly, I think it was around December 18th.

365
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,590
So, I guess the guys of the organization

366
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,290
are hiding somewhere in this hospital.

367
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,290
There's no doubt about it.

368
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,790
"Haido Central Hospital."

369
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,690
I think we should move Rena Mizunashi

370
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,990
to another place right now!

371
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,190
Now that we know that the guys of the Organization

372
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,390
are hiding here somewhere,

373
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,490
it's too risky to keep sheltering her here!

374
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,890
But, if we take rash measures,

375
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,690
it'll be like telling the guys of the Organization that she's here.

376
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,490
If there's another hospital that we can move her to,

377
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,490
we could do something about it now, but...

378
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,890
I think it's best to keep her here, as is.

379
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,990
As is?

380
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,990
Judging from the fact that they're disguising themselves

381
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,590
as patients here and asking the nurses for hints

382
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,790
on the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi,

383
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,990
it shows that they're still in the process of looking for her.

384
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,990
It's not that they've come here knowing that she's here.

385
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,890
Besides, this could be our chance.

386
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,990
Our chance?

387
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,790
Yeah, to add another string to the only one we had.

388
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,690
It's true that capturing the man

389
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,290
before they find out about anything would be ideal but...

390
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,090
There seems to be over 20 men

391
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,990
who were hospitalized here at the end of the year.

392
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,890
It would be way too difficult to check on all those people

393
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,590
hiding our identities as FBI agents.

394
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,790
Moreover, it would be too time consuming.

395
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,790
If that nurse

396
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,090
could only recall what day the man asked her the question.

397
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,890
I think it was between December 18th to the 21st,

398
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,790
during one of these four days!

399
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,690
Pardon?

400
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,390
Teitan High School's winter vacation starts from December 23rd.

401
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,890
It seems that Eisuke talked about coming here

402
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,890
before winter vacation started so,

403
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,390
he must've come here before the 21st.

404
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,190
If the store started selling the sandals on December the 18th,

405
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,490
the only people you need to check are those

406
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,890
who were hospitalized before the 21st, right?

407
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,690
Right!

408
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,790
Okay, let's have the hospital

409
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,590
submit a list of all the patients that fall in this category!

410
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,290
The only other thing that bothers me

411
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,790
is the whereabouts of the boy called Eisuke.

412
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,990
Well, as far as the FBI is concerned,

413
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,490
it's more convenient that

414
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,290
he stays out of the scene as is, for now.

415
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,690
Having NOC's son snooping here and there,

416
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,690
could call for more trouble.

417
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,190
NOC?

418
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,190
Non Official Cover,

419
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,690
more commonly known as NOC!

420
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,690
They are secret agents who disguise themselves as ordinary citizens

421
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,090
in foreign countries and go about their activities!

422
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,190
You seem to know a lot of things,

423
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,690
and yet this is the first time you heard this terminology?

424
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,090
No, I know about it, but something about that word bothers me.

425
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,590
Non Official Cover,

426
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,090
more commonly know as NOC.

427
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,190
There's no reason they would leave a boy

428
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,690
who knows their boss' e-mail address, as is,

429
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,290
without doing anything.

430
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,690
Well, if you're worried as to whether NOC's son is safe,

431
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,590
he's probably not.

432
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,590
Who are the members of the Black Organization

433
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,590
that are looking for Rena Mizunashi?

434
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,390
I've narrowed it down to three men

435
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,090
and I'm going to get in touch with them immediately!

436
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,790
No matter how dangerous it may be,

437
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,290
I'm going to tear off the masks that they're wearing

438
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,190
and grab a clue on the Black Organization!

439
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,190
Next on Detective Conan,

440
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,890
"Red and Black Crash: Raid."

441
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,690
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,890
Mark of a wound.

443
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,590
That's it, for children's time.

444
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,890
Kids, on your mark and go to bed.

445
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,390
Mark out the course.
