1
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,175
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:23,175
Next, we'll be performing a song with a lot of beat.

3
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,475
"Everlasting Luv"!

4
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,775
Love is eternal. Labyrinths are mysterious.

5
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:30,275
Saturday nights are for mystery.

6
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,075
Solve the locked dressing room trick

7
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,675
and disclose the mixing noise in the band.

8
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:36,275
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,075
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,975
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:22,484
"The Hand that Plays in Dissonance"

12
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:33,384
"Yukiko Watanbe (24), Vocalist"

13
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:37,984
"Makoto Nishimoto (25), Guitarist"

14
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:42,684
"Shota Aoki (27), Bass Player"

15
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:47,384
"Risako Tanaka (22), Keyboard Player"

16
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:51,684
"Yusuke Nakamura (30), Drummist"

17
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,384
"Yuuki Sakamoto (38), Music Producer"

18
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,284
Conan, eat to your heart's content. No need to hold back!

19
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:11,484
Don't worry about a thing! It's my treat!

20
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:16,484
I can have anything I like? But all there is here are soy beans, sausage

21
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:18,084
and finger food you eat with alcoholic drinks.

22
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:21,484
What's wrong? Soy beans and sausages for dinner.

23
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:22,984
Isn't it great?

24
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:24,784
One more glass of beer!

25
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:27,484
Dad, don't drink too much.

26
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:29,084
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,484
I wasted half a day shopping with you since you wanted to buy clothes.

28
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,384
Stop nagging me about drinking beer.

29
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:37,184
But still...

30
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,984
I don't know any of the songs.

31
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,084
We'll play something different now.

32
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,884
It's a song that I'm sure you've all heard.

33
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:54,784
Play Yoko Okino's "Moon Lady"!

34
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,984
Don't tell me you can't play it!

35
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,384
Hey, dad!

36
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:00,084
I'm going to the washroom.

37
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:04,284
Next, we'd like to play S&G's masterpiece for you.

38
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:07,184
They can't play Yoko's song.

39
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:11,484
"8th Floor"

40
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,084
Drawings?

41
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,084
We had to draw in class the other day.

42
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:19,284
It wasn't easy trying to draw like a kid.

43
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:26,084
Excuse me. I'm sorry if I'm mistaken.

44
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:30,884
Are you the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

45
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:35,684
I am indeed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,384
Just as I thought!

47
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:40,284
Since you were saying, "Play Yoko Okino's song",

48
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:42,284
I thought that it could be you.

49
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:45,184
I saw you on air together with her.

50
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,384
My name is Yusuke Nakamura.

51
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,684
You saw me on television?

52
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,284
Hey, give me two glasses of beer!

53
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:53,584
No thanks.

54
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,084
I just thought that if you were him in person,

55
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:57,984
I'd like to have your autograph here.

56
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,484
No need to be hesitant.

57
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,884
Hey, Conan. Go and buy more snacks!

58
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,884
Okay.

59
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,884
You want my autograph? No problem.

60
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:09,884
"Stem beans and popcorn, Fried potato, Fried chicken, French sausage"

61
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:12,084
I'm sick of all these food already.

62
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,284
Huh? Where's Ran?

63
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,784
The guy just now seems to have the CD

64
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:24,384
that Ran's been looking for since some time ago,

65
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,284
so she followed him to the dressing room to borrow it.

66
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,384
I see.

67
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:29,884
"Basement, 1st floor"

68
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,784
Is the dressing room still open?

69
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:35,784
No, the key has been returned.

70
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:36,984
Here.

71
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,384
"Dressing Room, Non-personnel Are Prohibited"

72
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:46,984
I'm sorry, but could you wait for a while here?

73
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,084
Sure.

74
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,084
So this is how the musical instruments are stored away.

75
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,684
Huh? What's this?

76
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,584
Somebody!

77
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,184
What's the matter?

78
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,684
That...

79
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,984
I flipped that blanket over...

80
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:21,284
and found Yukiko...

81
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,384
She seems to be dead.

82
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,084
Hurry and get Mr. Mouri!

83
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,284
Okay!

84
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,584
A person was found dead?

85
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,184
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,484
Yukiko is...

87
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,484
She has been choked to death.

88
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,484
Ran, call the police!

89
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:00,684
Okay.

90
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,884
This is...

91
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:04,984
What is it?

92
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:12,384
So the band members are the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe,

93
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:15,184
you and three other people?

94
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,784
-Yes, sir. -Inspector.

95
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,284
According to the security guard,

96
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:20,084
the only people who borrowed the key to this room

97
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:22,584
are the members of the band.

98
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,284
Mr. Nakamura.

99
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,084
Could you contact the other three members

100
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,184
and ask them to come back to the department store?

101
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,284
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:35,484
Excuse me. There are green stains

103
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:37,884
on both shoulders of Ms. Yukiko.

104
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,284
Yeah.

105
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,984
Inspector, there is something around her shoulders.

106
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:46,284
Please go and check what it is right away.

107
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,284
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:50,784
What's wrong?

109
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:57,384
I can't help feeling that it looks different from when I first saw it.

110
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:58,784
What do you mean?

111
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,184
I don't really know.

112
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:07,584
The performance at the beer garden on the roof ended at 8.30 pm.

113
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:11,884
Ms. Yukiko's dead body was found at around 9.15 pm.

114
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:16,084
Will you each tell me what you were doing at that time?

115
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:19,284
I'd like to also know when you all last met Ms. Yukiko.

116
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:22,384
After I left the stage, I went to the dressing room

117
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:24,784
to store the instruments with the department store staff.

118
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:28,084
About 20 minutes later, I went to Mr. Mouri's table

119
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,684
and talked to him for about 15 minutes.

120
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:32,184
Then, I went to the dressing room with Ran.

121
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:35,084
The last time I saw Yukiko

122
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,484
was when she came down from the stage and left.

123
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,284
What about the rest of you?

124
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,684
I used the elevator to go down to the dressing room

125
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,584
together with Shota and Makoto,

126
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,684
and left for home with Shota about 5 minutes later.

127
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:50,684
According to the security guard's log, it was at 8.40 pm.

128
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:54,984
The last I saw Yukiko was in front of the elevator.

129
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,384
Go on without me.

130
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,484
That's what she said.

131
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,484
Me, too.

132
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:02,584
Same here.

133
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,584
What did you do after you left the department store?

134
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,384
Since Shota said he had something to do,

135
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,484
we parted right outside the department store.

136
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,984
What about you, Mr. Nishimoto?

137
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,484
About 5 minutes after they both left,

138
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,484
I returned the dressing room's key to the security guard and went home.

139
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:22,284
The log says the key was returned at 8.45 pm.

140
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,384
What about you, Mr. Aoki?

141
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:28,584
I waited for Yukiko for some time

142
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,584
in the car parked in the parking lot.

143
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,384
Why were you waiting for Yukiko?

144
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:37,884
I thought you were dating with Risako.

145
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:41,584
I wasn't dating Yukiko.

146
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,484
Then, why were you with Yukiko yesterday?

147
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,484
You told me you were busy!

148
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,784
So, you were seeing Yukiko after all!

149
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:51,384
Cut it out. This isn't the place to talk about it.

150
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,384
Before Mr. Nakamura and Ran came to borrow the dressing room's key,

151
00:09:55,384 --> 00:10:00,684
someone else came at 8.55 pm to borrow the key.

152
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,984
Mr. Shota Aoki.

153
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:06,184
It was you, wasn't it?

154
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,284
Yes.

155
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,384
Shota, don't tell me...

156
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,884
No.

157
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:16,784
Yukiko didn't show up for a while, so I went to check the dressing room.

158
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,584
But she wasn't there.

159
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,384
I waited for a while, but she didn't come.

160
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:24,184
So I had no choice but to return the key and left for home.

161
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:27,884
It was when the department staff were storing the musical instruments.

162
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:34,984
The security guard did say that the key was returned in about 5 minutes.

163
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,584
By the way, why were you waiting

164
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:40,884
for the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe?

165
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,484
From what you told us,

166
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:45,584
it seems that you two weren't dating each other either.

167
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:52,784
Yukiko and I were invited to join another band.

168
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,084
What?

169
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,384
We were asked by TMS Record

170
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:58,584
if we wanted to make a major debut with that band.

171
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:01,084
Is... Is that so?

172
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,884
What's this mark?

173
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:21,684
Inspector.

174
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:24,484
I've checked the footage of the surveillance camera in the elevator.

175
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,884
There isn't any footage showing Ms. Yukiko

176
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,184
going from the roof to the basement.

177
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,484
What?

178
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:32,784
Are you saying that Ms. Yukiko used the stairs

179
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:35,784
to go from the roof to the basement, then?

180
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,984
That's possible.

181
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,384
What makes you think so?

182
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:44,784
Mr. Sakamoto from TMS Record was at the beer garden tonight.

183
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,684
Mr. Sakamoto walked towards the stairs

184
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:50,384
when we were taking the elevator.

185
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:55,884
Could you please get in contact with that Mr. Sakamoto?

186
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,084
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:06,984
Yes. After the performance ended,

188
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:11,084
I did see Yukiko at the landing between the roof and 8th floor.

189
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,584
You killed Yukiko!

190
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,684
No! I...

191
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,884
told her how I felt about her performance and left right afterwards.

192
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:24,184
She said she didn't want the other members to see me with her.

193
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,284
Liar!

194
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:29,484
He's not the one who did it.

195
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:34,484
Neither he nor Yukiko had the key to the dressing room,

196
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,084
so they couldn't have gotten in.

197
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:37,984
You're getting so worked up.

198
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:41,284
Makoto, aren't you the one who killed Yukiko?

199
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:43,384
-What? -I already know

200
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:45,384
that Yukiko brushed you off.

201
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:48,784
I bet Yukiko came back before you returned the key, right?

202
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:49,884
And that's when you...

203
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,184
According to Shota, when he came back from the dressing room,

204
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:54,784
there was nobody there, right?

205
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:59,384
You were the one who had the key all afternoon, weren't you?

206
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:02,284
Maybe you made a spare key back then?

207
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:03,584
Don't be ridiculous!

208
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,684
You thought that Yukiko took Shota away from you, right?

209
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,184
Stop, everyone!

210
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,084
It's a shame to be fighting among ourselves!

211
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:13,684
If we straighten the story out, it should be like this.

212
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,984
Ms. Yukiko who parted with Mr. Sakamoto

213
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,984
took the stairs and returned to the dressing room on Floor B1.

214
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:22,584
But since she didn't have the key,

215
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:26,084
the killer had to be the one who unlocked the door to the dressing room.

216
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:29,584
So it's either Mr. Nishimoto, before he returned the key,

217
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,184
Mr. Aoki who went back there once

218
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:36,884
or Ms. Ritsuko who could've secretly made a spare key.

219
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:40,584
The killer is among the three of you.

220
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:45,884
The landing of the stairs between the roof and 8th floor...

221
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,984
Yukiko was talking to Mr. Sakamoto over here.

222
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:54,084
After that, Yukiko took the stairs all the way down to B1.

223
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,684
Why didn't she use the elevator?

224
00:13:57,884 --> 00:13:59,484
Oh, no.

225
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,584
I came all the way here while being lost in thought.

226
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,284
This drawing... Could it be...

227
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,484
Is this it?

228
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:19,584
Could I be wrong?

229
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:22,584
Kid, what are you doing here?

230
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,684
It's nothing.

231
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:29,184
Come to think of it, the security guard's room is just nearby.

232
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,984
Yet, why did Ran...

233
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,684
Ran!

234
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,984
Conan.

235
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:36,184
When you saw Ms. Yukiko's body,

236
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:37,984
why did you come all the way to the roof to get us

237
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:40,784
instead of calling the security guard room that's close by?

238
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:45,584
Because Mr. Nakamura told me to go and get Mr. Mouri.

239
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,584
Oh, right. Conan.

240
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:51,184
I realized something strange.

241
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:53,384
The big drum.

242
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:57,884
When I first saw it, the drum was on top of this case.

243
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:00,184
But now it's gone.

244
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,184
I see.

245
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:13,784
Mr. Tome.

246
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:17,284
About the green stuff that was on Ms. Yukiko's shoulders...

247
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,484
That's right. It's amazing you figured it out.

248
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:25,684
All right. Everything's fallen into place now.

249
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:28,484
That's the killer.

250
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,227
Okay, everyone.

251
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:37,227
I need you all to tell me the details at the station.

252
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,627
No way. Do I have to go too?

253
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,627
I didn't kill her!

254
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,727
Mouri!

255
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,527
Don't tell me... Is this position...

256
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:51,727
Yes. It's nearing nightfall,

257
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,227
so it's about time we end all this

258
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,227
and solve this case.

259
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,327
Inspector, Conan was told by the forensic officer

260
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:08,827
that the green thing on the victim's shoulders was crayon.

261
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,227
Crayon?

262
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:12,927
I wonder where it got onto her.

263
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:17,627
There are no crayons in the dressing room.

264
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,327
Where on earth could it be?

265
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,127
It's the 8th floor.

266
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,327
The 8th floor?

267
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:26,727
Children's drawings are exhibited on the 8th floor.

268
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,527
According to Conan,

269
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:33,827
there seems to be a scrape mark on one of the drawings.

270
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,527
I'm sure that Ms. Yukiko was attacked on the 8th floor.

271
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:40,427
She was probably pushed against the drawing then,

272
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,627
and that's when the crayon scraped off onto her clothes.

273
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,727
-What? -In other words,

274
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:48,127
she wasn't killed in the dressing room, but on the 8th floor.

275
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,527
But the body was found in the dressing room.

276
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,027
Her body was moved there.

277
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,527
Officer Takagi.

278
00:16:55,527 --> 00:17:00,127
Was there a rectangular mark near her neck?

279
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,727
Yes, there was.

280
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,027
Dad, I brought it with me.

281
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,627
What's that?

282
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:13,927
The case for the bass drum.

283
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,127
Ran, can you open the lid?

284
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:17,227
All right.

285
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:19,227
Inspector.

286
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:23,527
There's a metal piece in there for fixing the handle in place, right?

287
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,227
The mark on her leg that you saw

288
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,727
was left behind by the metal piece pushed against it.

289
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,027
What?

290
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:34,027
Ms. Yukiko's body was put inside that bass drum case

291
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,727
and carried to where she was found.

292
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:40,127
Isn't that right, Mr. Nakamura?

293
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,727
Why are you asking me?

294
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,027
You're the only one to ask.

295
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:51,327
You're the only one who helped put away the musical instruments,

296
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:55,827
so only you had the chance to put Yukiko's body inside.

297
00:17:57,127 --> 00:18:00,527
But when I unlocked the door and went into the dressing room,

298
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:03,227
Yukiko's body was already inside the room.

299
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,427
Ms. Ran saw that too.

300
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:07,727
After I finished cleaning up the dressing room,

301
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:11,027
I was with you and Ms. Ran the whole time.

302
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:15,227
How on earth would I have time to carry the body to the dressing room?

303
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,427
Unfortunately, the body that Ran saw

304
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:21,327
was not Ms. Yukiko's body.

305
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:24,427
What do you mean, Mouri?

306
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:27,727
Mr. Mouri, I brought what you asked for.

307
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,927
-Isn't that a mannequin? -Yes.

308
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:33,527
It was in the sports clothing store on the 8th floor.

309
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:37,527
As you can see, the left hand has been removed.

310
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:38,927
The hand that Ran saw

311
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:42,627
was the left hand of this mannequin.

312
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:43,827
I see.

313
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:47,027
If it's only the hand of a mannequin, he could carry it in easily.

314
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:51,827
But back then, I wasn't carrying the hand of a mannequin, was I?

315
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,627
Mr. Nakamura.

316
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:56,627
Will you please sound your guitar?

317
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,827
Officer Takagi, will you please sound the guitar?

318
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,027
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:12,827
Huh? It's out of tune.

320
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:16,627
Mr. Nakamura, you were carrying that guitar

321
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:19,627
when you entered the dressing room, weren't you?

322
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:24,027
The hand of that mannequin was hidden inside your guitar.

323
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:28,527
After you hid Ms. Yukiko's body into the drum case,

324
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:31,027
you removed the left hand of that mannequin,

325
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:34,027
then put Yukiko's glove onto it,

326
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,027
and hid it inside the guitar.

327
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:40,427
You probably used masking tape to stick it on.

328
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,827
When he asked me to sign on the guitar,

329
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:46,727
he really got me.

330
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,227
Then, you made Ran wait in the corridor and went into the dressing room,

331
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:54,427
and took out the mannequin's hand that you had hidden in your guitar.

332
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,727
You set it up using a cushion and blanket,

333
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,427
making it look like a person was there,

334
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,727
and placed the mannequin's hand there.

335
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:05,127
Then, you made Ran think that Ms. Yukiko was lying on the ground.

336
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,727
No way.

337
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:10,927
Leader...

338
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,227
After you told Ran to go and get me,

339
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:17,927
you carried the drum case containing Ms. Yukiko's body

340
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,527
into the dressing room.

341
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:25,627
Then, you took the body out of the case, put the glove on her left hand,

342
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:28,627
and lay her down under the blanket.

343
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:34,427
After that, you most likely hid the mannequin's hand into your guitar.

344
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:38,327
But you didn't have time to tune the guitar.

345
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:41,427
This is the truth.

346
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:43,527
Leader...

347
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:45,527
Why did you do that?

348
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:49,927
This band is my life.

349
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,327
I thought all of you felt the same.

350
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,027
I'll call you again.

351
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,227
Okay.

352
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:00,927
Leader.

353
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,627
It was rumoured that you and Shota

354
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:06,827
were going to join the new band that's going to be formed.

355
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,427
Looks like it's true.

356
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,927
That's right. Is there a problem?

357
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,027
You were ousted by the previous band you were in

358
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:16,727
because you promoted yourself to a record company, weren't you?

359
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:20,427
You're able to sing now thanks to us. Don't you think so?

360
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,927
-What a joke. -What?

361
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,827
You guys made it this far because I joined you.

362
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,227
Without me, a lowly band like yours would've fallen apart long ago.

363
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,027
What did you say?

364
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:37,127
You should be thankful for the fact that you served as a stepping stone

365
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,227
for me to make my major debut.

366
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:51,427
I really believed...

367
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,927
that everyone else felt the same.

368
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,227
I really believed that.

369
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,427
Mr. Nakamura.

370
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:05,327
Please give us the details at the station.

371
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,427
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:36,827
Looks like the beer kicked in after he solved the case.

373
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:38,827
Don't mention it. No problem at all.

374
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:40,327
"Mouri's Detective Agency"

375
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:45,027
Okay, we're here. Don't forget to take your things.

376
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:49,027
Ran, where are the things you bought?

377
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,927
I forgot about them! The clothes I bought!

378
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,927
I'll head back to Beika Department Store.

379
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:56,427
-Thank you so much. -Thank you so much.
