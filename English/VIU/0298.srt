1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,438
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,138
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,838
How will Pops Kogoro's statement help the case?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,938
How will it affect the Prosecution's, the Defense and Conan's case?

5
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,538
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,538
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,839
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,277 --> 00:02:02,076
Ms. Kisaki and Ms. Kujo, the "Madonna" of the prosecutor's office

9
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:04,676
are to battle it out in court again.

10
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:08,976
The case is about the defendant is accused to breaking into an office

11
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:10,376
and when the victim found out, they fought,

12
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,777
he accidentally kills the victim during the struggle.

13
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:18,976
But Prosecutor Kujo claims that he did intend to kill the victim

14
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,977
and he is charged with burglary and murder!

15
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,076
Pops Kogoro and I start to investigate

16
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:29,676
and we discover something at the crime scene.

17
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:30,777
It can't be...

18
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:34,176
I knew it!

19
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:35,177
I don't get it.

20
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:40,376
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

21
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,776
What did you say?

22
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:44,377
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

23
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,777
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

24
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,376
What's this?

25
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,676
That's it, I've got it now!

26
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,577
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

27
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:03,632
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 2)"

28
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,076
Thank you for your help.

29
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:12,476
No problem. Was I of any help to your case?

30
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,376
Well, the police and the prosecutor's office

31
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:17,476
already went through the place thoroughly.

32
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:21,576
I didn't expect to find anything to overturn the case.

33
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,176
I see.

34
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,376
I know.

35
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:28,776
Why don't you come to my restaurant now and have something to eat?

36
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,076
I'll bring out a special wine.

37
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,676
No, that'd be too much.

38
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,476
He was nice enough to offer!

39
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,176
It wouldn't hurt to drop by!

40
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,976
Kogoro...

41
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:41,376
Have you forgotten, Ran's waiting for you at home?

42
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,876
Your daughter?

43
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,076
Yes.

44
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,476
Why don't you ask her to come too?

45
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,776
Geez, that's nice of you.

46
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:52,676
The more the merrier when it comes to dining, I always say.

47
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,577
Thank you, we accept then.

48
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:09,076
This is a very good wine.

49
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,476
I'm glad you like it.

50
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,976
I like the atmosphere of your restaurant.

51
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,276
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:20,376
I'll be testifying at the next trial,

53
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,876
please go easy on me.

54
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,076
You found your father-in-law's body

55
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,576
when you went to return something he'd forgotten, didn't you?

56
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:31,876
Yes. He had dinner here and left without his glasses.

57
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:32,877
His glasses?

58
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,277
Yes, his reading glasses.

59
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,577
Take your time and enjoy your meal.

60
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,876
This restaurant looks fancy

61
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,576
but the pasta isn't very good, right?

62
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:49,776
You're right.

63
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,377
The olive oil is a little heavy.

64
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:59,376
By the way, how are things for the next trial going?

65
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,576
Not too good.

66
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:05,576
You'll lose unless you change your approach.

67
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,276
And what do you mean by that?

68
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:10,576
You won't get him off on the burglary and murder charge.

69
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,276
So you've to stress the fact that he did it out of love for his daughter

70
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:18,176
and that the victim was also at fault.

71
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,576
Are you saying I should accept the prosecution's charges

72
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,376
and ask for leniency due to extenuating circumstances?

73
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:24,876
What choice do you have?

74
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:26,276
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,976
The defendant insists that he had no intention of killing him!

76
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,776
You believe everything your client tells you,

77
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,576
that's why "Madonna" always gets you in court.

78
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:36,776
Don't you tell me how to do my job!

79
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:39,777
I'm not helping you because I want to, you know?

80
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:43,276
Come on you two, that's enough!

81
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,576
Why do you always fight like this?

82
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:48,777
I'm sure that on the list of things found on the crime scene.

83
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,976
I'm sure it was in here somewhere.

84
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,376
Here it is!

85
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:57,976
I've found it.

86
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,176
The undeniable proof!

87
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:02,076
Conan?

88
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,276
What is it? Why are you looking through the files?

89
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,976
Well, something in here was bothering me.

90
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,576
What do you mean?

91
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,676
Look, see this list of things found on the crime scene...

92
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:13,976
Hey, you!

93
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:17,577
You keep messing around with important documents!

94
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,676
Good grief!

95
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,076
Well if you're going to be like that,

96
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:26,776
why don't you think of something that'll help mom?

97
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,076
She's so stubborn.

98
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:31,176
I hope "Madonna" beats her in court.

99
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:32,376
Just listen to you!

100
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:35,476
I'll bet you just don't have the confidence to beat Ms. Kujo.

101
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:36,776
You've got some nerve!

102
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,076
She's no match for me.

103
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,976
Then why don't you defend him?

104
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:45,776
He can't. Dad doesn't have a license to practice law.

105
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:48,676
Why can't he be a special counsel then?

106
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,176
What's that?

107
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,176
If someone with a license to practice law

108
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,676
or if the defendant makes a request,

109
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:59,176
the person they indicate can act as a lawyer.

110
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:05,276
Show the court how brilliant your deductive powers are.

111
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,476
My brilliant deductive powers?

112
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:13,376
Well, any crime can be solved by me.

113
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:17,777
If you insist, let me think about it.

114
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:23,076
What? Him as special counsel?

115
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:27,176
Yes! He wants to help you so much, mom.

116
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,676
Thanks but no thanks.

117
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:30,677
But why?

118
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:33,776
Dad really wants to help!

119
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:38,176
So you say but I just don't think he has the ability.

120
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,376
But...

121
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,876
I have a message from Pops Kogoro,

122
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,376
he wants you and the building superintendent

123
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,876
to come to the crime scene tonight.

124
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,976
What? To the crime scene?

125
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,576
He said you'll see something

126
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:54,376
that will change the way things are going in court.

127
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,377
Change the way things are going in court?

128
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,076
I'm sorry to have to put you through this again.

129
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:04,276
I don't mind but what do you want me to do?

130
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:07,777
I'm not too clear on that myself.

131
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,076
Mr. Akiyama.

132
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:14,576
Will you do exactly what you did that night?

133
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,177
Hey, Conan. Where is Kogoro?

134
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,576
He stepped outside to get things ready.

135
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,076
Outside?

136
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,676
"Takuya Akiyama (56)" -All right, I understand.

137
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,676
"Superintendent" -Just do exactly like the other night, right?

138
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:31,276
Let's see, there was no one here that night when I got here,

139
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,376
Mr. Arima looked through that little window

140
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:35,176
to see inside the office.

141
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,576
And he said somebody was inside, didn't he?

142
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:38,676
Yes, that's right.

143
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:42,576
So I took a look too and...

144
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:44,176
What is that?

145
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,076
I don't believe it!

146
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:47,376
Impossible!

147
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:48,676
Is there somebody inside?

148
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,176
I don't understand.

149
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,177
Take a look for yourself, Ms. Kisaki.

150
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:56,776
What is that?

151
00:08:56,777 --> 00:09:00,876
I set things up exactly like Pops Kogoro told me to.

152
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,776
Set things up?

153
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,676
Are you saying he knows who the killer is?

154
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:09,577
Yes, he said he'd explain everything in court.

155
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:14,677
"Second Trial of Burglary and Murder Case."

156
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:23,877
With mom and dad on the same side, we can't lose.

157
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,376
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -Who would have thought,

158
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:32,376
she'd ask Kogoro Mouri be appointed special counsel,

159
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:35,676
Attorney Kisaki must be really desperate.

160
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:36,777
All rise!

161
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,776
Mr. Akiyama.

162
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:53,376
You stated that you looked into the victim's office

163
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:54,576
through the small window

164
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,976
and saw him being beaten by the defendant,

165
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,876
is that correct?

166
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,476
Yes.

167
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,976
How many times did the assailant's strike the victim?

168
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,776
I saw three blows being delivered.

169
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,476
Shortly after that,

170
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,976
you heard the sound of the victim falling to the floor, correct?

171
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:13,977
Yes.

172
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,076
End of questioning!

173
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,676
Does the defense have any questions for the witness?

174
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:18,777
I do.

175
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,676
Mr. Akiyama.

176
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:28,176
You claim that you saw the victim being hit

177
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:31,276
but did you see the assailant's face?

178
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,976
No, I...

179
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:37,477
I didn't actually see the assailant's face.

180
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,776
What do you mean by that?

181
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:43,376
What exactly did you see then?

182
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:47,577
The light outside cast the assailant's shadow on the wall.

183
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:52,176
Order in the court!

184
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:56,176
So you're saying you merely saw the assailant's shadow, correct?

185
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,076
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,576
It's the same thing.

187
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:02,776
As long as he saw the assailant, seeing his shadow is good enough.

188
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:05,276
Let me ask you one more time.

189
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:08,776
Mr. Akiyama, is the defendant here,

190
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:12,976
the assailant you saw that evening?

191
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:17,976
No, like I said, I only saw a shadow on the wall.

192
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,776
So you're not sure that the defendant is the assailant then, correct?

193
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,176
Yes.

194
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,777
Thank you.

195
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:28,876
No more questions.

196
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:32,076
Gosh! What is dad doing?

197
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,976
He hasn't done anything except sleep.

198
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:37,276
Don't worry, his time will come.

199
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,976
Are you sure?

200
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,877
I would like to call Mr. Arima to the witness stand.

201
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:46,676
Mr. Arima, you and Mr. Akiyama heard

202
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:49,376
the sound of the victim falling, didn't you?

203
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,876
Yes, I'm certain of it.

204
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,076
The door was locked so you broke it down by ramming into it

205
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:57,876
and then ran inside.

206
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:01,276
Yes. But the assailant's had already escaped through the window

207
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,376
and my father-in-law,

208
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:05,976
I mean, Mr. Otsu was on the floor.

209
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,576
And what about the safe?

210
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,176
It was open.

211
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,576
No more questions.

212
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,377
Defense, your turn.

213
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,076
Here goes.

214
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:22,276
Guess it's time for me to liven up this boring trial.

215
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:24,676
Good luck, dad.

216
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,377
I'll see how he does first!

217
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:48,905
Special counsel, you may proceed to question the witness.

218
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,005
Yes, sir!

219
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,805
Mr. Arima.

220
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:56,705
You claimed that you arrived at the victim's office a little past 9 pm

221
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,105
to deliver an item he'd forgotten, is that correct?

222
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,705
Yes, my father-in-law forgot his reading glasses at my restaurant.

223
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:06,605
But the office was locked and you couldn't enter.

224
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:08,405
That's right.

225
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:11,805
The door was actually unlocked, wasn't it?

226
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,705
And the victim was in his office

227
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:18,405
counting the money in the safe.

228
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,405
What are you getting at?

229
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,205
Are you implying that I...

230
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,105
No, I'm merely pointing out the fact that

231
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:27,705
you could have committed the crime too.

232
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,706
Ridiculous!

233
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,905
Why would I kill my father-in-law?

234
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,605
When it comes to money,

235
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:36,305
you can't trust your own family.

236
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:40,405
Unlike usual, Pops Kogoro is actually making some sense.

237
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:41,705
Objection!

238
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:45,005
Special counsel is merely voicing his own opinion!

239
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,005
Objection granted.

240
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:51,205
Special counsel shall stick to the facts at hand.

241
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,505
But based on my many years of experience,

242
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:59,905
the first person to report the crime is usually the guilty one.

243
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,905
All right then, based on your many years of experience,

244
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:06,205
how do you explain the things left on the crime scene

245
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:11,105
and the defendant's fingerprints on the safe?

246
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,805
When the witness and the victim were fighting over money,

247
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:18,505
the defendant was looking in through the window, watching them.

248
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:21,505
Well, that's a new theory.

249
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,705
Then after the witness hit the victim over the head and left,

250
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:28,805
the defendant took the opportunity to enter the office

251
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:32,305
to steal the money in the safe.

252
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:37,005
Then who was the assailant Mr. Akiyama saw?

253
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:40,605
The truth is, the victim wasn't dead yet.

254
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:44,305
He regained consciousness and struggled with the defendant.

255
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:47,305
Hey, now you're going way off base.

256
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:48,505
What you're saying then is,

257
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:52,705
the defendant did indeed commit the murder

258
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:55,405
I guess I am.

259
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,005
What are you saying?

260
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,405
You're supposed to be here to defend the client!

261
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,405
I'm a famous private detective!

262
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:05,205
I'm here to solve this case!

263
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,305
I was a fool to depend on you.

264
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,005
Forget it! You just keep out of my way!

265
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:14,805
How dare you? I'm not finished, I'm getting to the best part.

266
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:18,006
Family fuels should be carried out elsewhere.

267
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,905
I hate you, dad!

268
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:26,505
I guess it's time I took Pops Kogoro out.

269
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:29,705
You just sit down and keep your mouth shut!

270
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,706
Am I your decoration piece?

271
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:39,005
Your honor, I'd like to retract my previous statements.

272
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,305
Just forget it.

273
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:45,105
The defendant entered that office before Mr. Arima,

274
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,205
not after.

275
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:52,005
The victim walked in on him while he was trying to get the safe open,

276
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:56,905
he hit the victim inadvertently and ran out of the office.

277
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,405
The question is what happened after that.

278
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:03,805
The defendant thought he had killed the victim

279
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:07,205
but the truth is, he had just knocked him unconscious.

280
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:12,605
Someone else arrived on the scene shortly after and killed him!

281
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:15,205
Are you saying that it was me?

282
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:18,205
You claimed that the victim forgot his reading glasses

283
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,005
in your restaurant, isn't that correct?

284
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,205
Yes.

285
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,705
Did he need his reading glasses during meals too?

286
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,805
Well, he needs them to read the menu.

287
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:30,005
That's strange.

288
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:33,105
The indictment states that the victim opened the safe

289
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,305
because the defendant threatened him.

290
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,405
The victim didn't have his glasses,

291
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:42,005
I wonder how he managed to get the safe open

292
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,405
and his office was dark,

293
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,405
the only light was from the neon sign outside?

294
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,505
How should I know?

295
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:53,505
The victim was still alive

296
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:56,905
when you delivered his glasses, wasn't he?

297
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,706
Father, are you in?

298
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:01,805
What happened?

299
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,705
Your head's bleeding!

300
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:06,305
Leave me alone! It's nothing.

301
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:09,205
That was right after he wandered in on the burglar.

302
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:10,705
I'm sure when he regained consciousness,

303
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,705
the first thing he was concerned with was the money in the safe.

304
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,406
I have your glasses here.

305
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,205
When you saw the money,

306
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:26,605
you thought of killing him

307
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:31,705
and you hit over the head with the ashtray.

308
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,706
Prosecutor!

309
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,705
I came here as a witness.

310
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,605
Why am I being treated like a suspect?

311
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:41,805
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten one very important detail.

312
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:45,005
The witness has an alibi.

313
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,006
You bet I do!

314
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:48,605
I was outside of the office when father was beaten

315
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:50,305
and fell to the floor,

316
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,705
Mr. Akiyama was with me.

317
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:56,705
Didn't you hear Mr. Akiyama's testimony?

318
00:17:56,706 --> 00:18:00,305
He said that he never saw the assailant.

319
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:03,105
But he saw a shadow.

320
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,905
Yes, a shadow on the wall.

321
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:09,105
You committed murder blinded by the money,

322
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:12,405
now you had to make it look like a burglary, you were desperate.

323
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:14,905
Then you came up with an idea.

324
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:19,205
That is using the clock in the victim's office

325
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:22,506
that has a decoration attached on it.

326
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:27,705
Your honor!

327
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,905
This clock is exactly like the one in the victim's office.

328
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:37,405
The assailant's evidently used the movements of this figure

329
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,205
along with the light from the outside

330
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:42,005
and cast its shadow on the wall

331
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:46,505
then led Mr. Akiyama into mistaking the time.

332
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:49,205
What about the sound? Explain that!

333
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,705
Mr. Akiyama and I hear my father fall!

334
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,205
That's easy.

335
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,405
What?

336
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,805
You probably put a golf ball

337
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:02,705
tied with a string under the leg of the desk in the victim's office.

338
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,005
The other end of the string led under the door

339
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,505
to the outside of the office

340
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,405
and when Mr. Akiyama looked inside and got a scare,

341
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:10,306
you pulled the string.

342
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,506
See? Didn't I say it was easy?

343
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,705
Do you have any proof I did it?

344
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,605
Anyone could have done what you said!

345
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,305
If you have proof that I did it, I'd like to see it!

346
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,905
The witness is right.

347
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,405
If you're insisting he's guilty,

348
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:33,905
I'd like to see some proof too!

349
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,005
The proof, Prosecutor,

350
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:40,105
is on that list of things found at the crime scene that you're holding.

351
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,206
On this list?

352
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:47,005
It says screw for eyeglasses, doesn't it?

353
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:50,405
If it belongs to the victim's reading glasses,

354
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:53,705
when did it get where it was found?

355
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,906
He was supposed to have left his glasses at the restaurant.

356
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:04,505
It came loose and fell off when the assailant hit the victim,

357
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,206
that's the only explanation I can think of.

358
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,405
Another thing, Mr. Arima.

359
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:12,005
You used your cook's apron

360
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:15,505
to wipe your fingerprints off the ashtray, didn't you?

361
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,605
The lab report stated that the ashtray was wiped

362
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:22,605
with a cloth containing oil.

363
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:26,005
Requesting permission to have a sample of the olive oil

364
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:29,505
used in Mr. Arima's restaurant to be tested

365
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:32,106
against the oil on the cloth used to wipe the ashtray!

366
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,605
Mr. Arima, after the crime,

367
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:41,506
you repaid a loan of 50 million yen, didn't you?

368
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:48,706
We can always have that money tested for fingerprints.

369
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:54,605
He deserved it!

370
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:56,706
That abusive old man.

371
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:03,605
You must be relieved, your money's safe.

372
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,605
Do you want some of this?

373
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:10,005
But if you don't pay me back what you owe me by next week,

374
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,905
I don't care if you are my daughter's husband,

375
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,206
I'm going to have you kicked out of that restaurant!

376
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:18,705
Mr. Mouri, you were right about everything.

377
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:20,906
I killed my father-in-law!

378
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,305
Your honor,

379
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,305
I would like to revise charges of burglary and murder

380
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,205
against the defendant to attempted burglary

381
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:39,005
and I would like to press charges against Mr. Arima.

382
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,705
Does the defense have any objections?

383
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,305
None.

384
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:47,706
Then the court is dismissed!

385
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:18,805
Ms. Kisaki.

386
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:20,805
A terrible injustice was about to be made,

387
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:24,205
thank you for preventing it.

388
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:27,505
I was just doing my job

389
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,206
I'll be looking forward to seeing you in court again then.

390
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:38,505
Why don't we all go get something to eat to celebrate?

391
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:40,805
That reminds me, I'm hungry.

392
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:43,005
How about some delicious wine and Italian cuisine?

393
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,605
I think I'd like some Japanese rice wine and raw fish instead.

394
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:50,905
No wait, cold beer and some piping hot stew sounds good too.

395
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:54,705
Or Chinese cuisine with old Chinese liquor.

396
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:56,706
Who cares?

397
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:03,905
"Next Episode" -The murdered occurred after that,

398
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:07,205
probably sometime past 11.

399
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,105
I'm so happy, all four of them have alibis.

400
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:11,206
Yeah.

401
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:20,305
I see.

402
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:23,206
The alibi can be broken then!

403
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,305
Next Conan,
