1
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,487
Today's stage is set at a candy house.

2
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:24,187
The trick is a sugary, sweet, simple trap.

3
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:26,287
Once you get in, there's no way out.

4
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:27,787
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,587
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,488
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:05,594
It only costs 500 yen to get in to the museum.

8
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:08,994
And what's more surprising is you can eat Ecriture's cake at half price!

9
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,494
You going to regret it for the rest of your life

10
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:13,294
if you miss this opportunity!

11
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:17,094
Wait, Sonoko! The cake isn't gonna run away!

12
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,995
Well, I want to run away.

13
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:21,794
Here! It's here!

14
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,894
"Ecriture."

15
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,994
Now, let's go! Ran!

16
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,394
Sonoko.

17
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,094
Come on, Ran! And you too, kid!

18
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,895
Now, hurry up...

19
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:40,795
Isn't it just like the candy house in "Hansel and Gretel"?

20
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,394
It's all made of cake and candies?

21
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,494
I can't believe it!

22
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:50,194
Look how many sweets are here.

23
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,195
All right!

24
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,694
Now, the morning part begins!

25
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:56,194
What do you mean "the morning part"?

26
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:58,594
Ran, do you know?

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,494
This event is has two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

28
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,794
I guess Sonoko wants to eat now,

29
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,995
just to get her stomach ready for the afternoon.

30
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:10,295
No way. I really want to go home.

31
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:17,695
"The Witch in a Candy House."

32
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,695
So each patissier has his own booth?

33
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,994
Which one I should start off with?

34
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,694
The person in this photo...

35
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:28,895
Isn't he that man over there.

36
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:13,694
My god.

37
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,595
How can he make three cakes at the same time?

38
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:21,794
"Tsuyoshi Maeda (28), Patissier."

39
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,994
This is like fighting rather than cooking.

40
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,894
Oh, you didn't know?

41
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:29,594
He is actually called Fighting Patissier by people.

42
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,994
So he is the one in the "Iron Patissier"?

43
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:35,794
Right. The patissier in the middle with the elegant move.

44
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:38,194
"Yasou Fujino (30)" -is the Prince of Sweets.

45
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,994
See the patissier in the back?

46
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,294
She makes candies just like magic,

47
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,295
"Yumi Morimoto (26)" -so people call her Candy Magician.

48
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,495
He is like an idol.

49
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:07,894
Would you like to make one?

50
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,494
What? Me?

51
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:14,894
Yes...

52
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,594
Come on. I will help you.

53
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,794
It sounds fun. Do it, Conan.

54
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,294
No, I'm okay.

55
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,194
Here...

56
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,994
Yes...

57
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,394
-Don't worry. It's simple. -Excuse me!

58
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,694
-No. Ran, why don't you try? -Yes...

59
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:30,794
Yes.

60
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,494
-Me? No, I'm okay. -Yes...

61
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,594
It's not like we came here everyday. You go ahead and do it.

62
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,494
It's the last part.

63
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:39,094
Everybody can do it.

64
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,395
I will give you this one after it's done.

65
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,994
All you need to do is put the chocolate cream on the roll cake.

66
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,194
Make it thick.

67
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,694
Then, make tree patterns with this fork.

68
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:55,794
Now, try it.

69
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:56,995
With a fork?

70
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,294
If you want to be popular with girls these days,

71
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,695
you gotta learn to make cake.

72
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,094
I think that's pretty good.

73
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,594
Right, Sonoko?

74
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,394
I guess so.

75
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:22,595
She's still upset.

76
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,794
I will finish the rest so I can give this to you.

77
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,794
Are you going to stay here for the afternoon too?

78
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,794
Oh, yes! Of course! Right?

79
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:32,895
Yes.

80
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:38,295
These candies look so alive, right?

81
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:50,394
As expected of the Candy Magician.

82
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:52,794
Looks like glass art, isn't it?

83
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,494
Thank you!

84
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:57,294
This kind of invisible feel is the real magic behind the taste.

85
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,395
Here you go!

86
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,195
Pretty candy tastes better.

87
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:08,795
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

88
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:15,794
Miss, this is tasty!

89
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,095
Thank you!

90
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:20,894
I don't know which to choose.

91
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:22,194
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:24,294
It's simple. Eat them all.

93
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,395
All of it?

94
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:33,094
Here! Hold this, will you?

95
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:36,195
We'll have this first.

96
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,894
This one too.

97
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:40,994
This one.

98
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:45,494
And this one...

99
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:47,594
You want me to get something for you too, kid?

100
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,394
No. I'm okay!

101
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,194
I will get it myself.

102
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,494
Okay.

103
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,395
Then, I'm gonna get some more.

104
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:00,295
Dangerous...

105
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:06,895
Are you ok?

106
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:11,095
"Sachiko Hashigaki (45)" -I'm sorry!

107
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,594
I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,394
I just ruined your cake.

109
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:20,494
Doesn't matter as long as it tastes good.

110
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,495
Well, it does matter.

111
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,294
How it looks and how it's made.

112
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,795
Looks really matter when it comes to today's sweets.

113
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:33,194
You can eat everything.

114
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:35,095
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

115
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:45,994
Hey, Maeda.

116
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,394
Why can't you act more sociable?

117
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,194
Why don't you learn something from Fujino?

118
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,894
If greeting people can make things taste better,

119
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,295
I'll do that as much as you want me to.

120
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,194
Hold on. You're still able to eat?

121
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,294
Of course.

122
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,894
Conan. What took you so long to pick your cake?

123
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:06,994
Ah, well...

124
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,094
All right!

125
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,295
I'm ready for the second round!

126
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:14,894
Well, I'm getting thirsty.

127
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,894
I'll get something to drink.

128
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:19,194
-I'll go with you, Conan. -Okay.

129
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,495
Then can you get me one too, please?

130
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:27,094
No sweets for a while, seriously.

131
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:28,594
Shinichi would say something like,

132
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:32,794
"What have you been eating while I was away?"

133
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,994
I wouldn't say anything like that.

134
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:36,695
Why would I?

135
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,794
I'm a chef and not a magician!

136
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,294
That's the way it is because that's what the customers want.

137
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,294
Please judge it based on taste!

138
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,394
You're so naive.

139
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,994
Do you know how many fantastic sweets exist in this world?

140
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,794
Cake and chocolates are dominating the sweets scene,

141
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:57,594
but your candies have got really popular because of my marketing skills,

142
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,095
and not because of how they taste!

143
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,894
When I came here yesterday,

144
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,994
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

145
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,994
You're so lucky!

146
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,394
What? You came here yesterday too?

147
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,394
No wonder you know so much about this place!

148
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,394
There you are.

149
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,894
I've been looking for you.

150
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:23,994
Here!

151
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:26,294
You know, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake you made.

152
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,495
How is it?

153
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,494
It's been nicely fixed.

154
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,894
Without the decorations,

155
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,394
it's just the same as the one in the store, isn't it?

156
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:38,695
It looks so delicious!

157
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:01,795
Oh my God.

158
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,770
"Ecriture" -The morning part of the event was finished past 12 pm.

159
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:21,870
And the dead body was found around 12:30 pm.

160
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:24,470
And where were you guys during that time?

161
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,570
I was in the kitchen making candies for the afternoon.

162
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:30,370
I was there alone since I let the cashiers out for lunch.

163
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:33,971
I went out to give them a cake after I was done with it.

164
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,870
Okay. So, you saw Ms. Hashigaki.

165
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,170
What was she doing?

166
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,670
She was doing some counting work.

167
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:46,370
She was working hard so I didn't talk to her.

168
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,470
Mr. Fujino left the kitchen to give a cake to Conan.

169
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:50,970
During this short period,

170
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,570
the suspect murdered Ms. Hashigaki.

171
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:56,470
Mr. Maeda, you were outside the candy house too, right?

172
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:59,670
I was in the office from 12:25 pm to 12:35 pm

173
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:03,470
since I was told that somebody was on the phone, waiting for me.

174
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:06,170
You seem to remember the time precisely.

175
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,070
Well, it's because...

176
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:11,570
I have a habit to keep my eyes on the watch when I do something.

177
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:13,670
You know, because we use stuff like the oven.

178
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,070
Who else was in the office?

179
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,170
Only myself.

180
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,470
The other staff were out to lunch, I think.

181
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:20,770
I see.

182
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,070
So, after Mr. Fujino left this place,

183
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,470
somebody murdered Ms. Hashigaki,

184
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,070
and Mr. Maeda found the dead body when he came back from the office.

185
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,070
-Am I right? -Yes.

186
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:33,170
Ms. Morimoto, you were the only one here.

187
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:36,670
Didn't you notice anybody coming in?

188
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,770
No.

189
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,670
The back of the victim's head was severely injured.

190
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:43,970
There could be a murder weapon inside the museum.

191
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,270
Search throughout the museum!

192
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,070
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

193
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,370
One of the chefs must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

194
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,670
Then, the type of the weapon

195
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,670
and how it was disposed would be the key to finding the suspect.

196
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:59,970
I think either Maeda or Fujino must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

197
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:01,171
-What are you talking about? -What are you talking about?

198
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,470
Yeah, it has to be!

199
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:07,270
Maeda owed her a lot of money

200
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:08,670
and Fujino wanted to go independent.

201
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,370
So you two were having trouble with her.

202
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,870
Everyone in the store knew about it.

203
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:13,871
Well, we aren't the only ones

204
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,470
who were having trouble with her, were we?

205
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:18,770
What do you mean?

206
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,970
She wanted to quit the candy-making performance,

207
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:24,170
because she was too confident in the taste of her candies.

208
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,570
You were having an argument with her

209
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,070
right before she was murdered, weren't you?

210
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,771
I heard your voice all the way across the hall.

211
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:35,870
It's true that Ms. Morimoto was having an argument with Ms. Hashigaki.

212
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,470
Please judge it based on the taste!

213
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:42,770
It's possible that Ms. Morimoto, who was left alone, murdered her.

214
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,170
Each kitchen is divided with partitions,

215
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,471
so nobody can see Ms. Morimoto from here.

216
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,170
The big tree gets in the way.

217
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,471
So, nobody can see what's going on here from Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

218
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,371
That means...

219
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:03,270
the other two chefs could've murdered Ms. Hashigaki as well.

220
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,970
You left here right after I left, right?

221
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,170
Don't you think it took too long just to find the kid?

222
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:10,870
The east space is huge.

223
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,370
It's not easy to find a person there.

224
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,970
Don't you think it was too good timing that you got a phone call?

225
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,670
The phone was already cut when I answered the phone.

226
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:22,070
This has to be be a setup!

227
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,470
You could've been the one who called

228
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:27,070
and told yourself to come to the office.

229
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,170
What?

230
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,870
We'll find out who killed Ms. Hashigaki

231
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,170
when we find the weapon!

232
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,070
Just to let you know, you are the one

233
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,470
who could kill Ms. Hashigaki the easiest.

234
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:38,470
Right!

235
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,370
The cakes are almost gone?

236
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:41,971
It's crazy.

237
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,470
A piece of wood?

238
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:54,470
Sir! No weapons were found.

239
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,870
I see. Nothing was found?

240
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:00,370
The weapon is gone because it's been eaten already.

241
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,970
Can we think this way?

242
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,770
What do you mean by that?

243
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,970
This is a candy house.

244
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,670
It's possible that the weapon was made of sweets.

245
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:12,170
Who would eat stuff that was used to kill somebody?

246
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,171
But if we think that way,

247
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:17,670
the types of sweets that were made into weapon would be limited.

248
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,070
It's not cookies.

249
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,670
They would break.

250
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,470
Not pies or tarts of course.

251
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,570
It can't be my chocolate.

252
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:28,070
Because is pretty soft.

253
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,170
Now what? You're saying I killed her with my candy

254
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,070
and ate the sweet bloody weapon?

255
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:35,970
A candy as a murder weapon.

256
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:37,970
It's too big to eat.

257
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,970
Or maybe she melted the candy.

259
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:47,170
She put the candy into a pot that was heated up beforehand.

260
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:49,170
I never done anything like that!

261
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:52,470
She could be the one who did those things

262
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:55,170
because nobody could hear or see what she was doing.

263
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,170
I didn't do it! It's the truth!

264
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:01,170
Well, we'll find out whether it's true or not,

265
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,270
after the identification.

266
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,170
Is she the killer?

267
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:10,171
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

268
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,971
No, it can't be.

269
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,770
This is...

270
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,171
As expected, she isn't be the murderer.

271
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:34,771
So messy.

272
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:44,370
How come pieces of wood are in the kitchen?

273
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,570
When I came here yesterday,

274
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,570
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

275
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:49,871
You're so lucky.

276
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:51,971
I got it!

277
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,270
So she was being used.

278
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,171
But you're not having it your way!

279
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,171
No. The murderer...

280
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:11,170
Ran.

281
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,371
Sonoko?

282
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,770
The murderer is not Ms. Morimoto.

283
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,770
Sonoko! That thing again?

284
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,870
What?

285
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:26,170
She was trying so hard to make candies for the afternoon

286
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,770
just to convince Ms. Hashigaki that she was good enough.

287
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:35,270
As a proof, there are candies in her kitchen for tasting.

288
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,470
Ran, could you show everybody the thing in my left hand?

289
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:39,971
Okay.

290
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,870
It seems like...

291
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,070
it's not something that is done half-way or a failure.

292
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,170
That piece of candy tells us

293
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:59,270
how much she wanted to be a patissier and not a magician.

294
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,270
I just wanted her to taste this one more time.

295
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,670
Then, who murdered Ms. Hashigaki?

296
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,270
The real suspect is...

297
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:10,270
The "Prince of Sweets", Mr. Fujino!

298
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:11,870
It's you.

299
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:12,970
First of all,

300
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:16,570
you called Mr. Maeda by phone just to let him out of here.

301
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,370
Then, after making sure Ms. Morimoto started using the blender,

302
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:21,070
you left the kitchen.

303
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,370
From this point, you can't see a thing

304
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:26,070
of what's going on in Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

305
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,970
Mr. Fujino used this blind spot!

306
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:30,470
Good work.

307
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:31,671
You, too.

308
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:42,471
I'll leave the rest to you.

309
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:51,770
So are you saying I killed her with candy?

310
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,371
No, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake!

311
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,770
Really! My Wood Chocolate Cake?

312
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:59,270
That soft chocolate became a weapon?

313
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,870
Okay, let me explain!

314
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,470
This house is called "The Candy House".

315
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,370
It seems that this candy house is totally made of sweets.

316
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:10,570
But the truth is that this is a wooden house that's coated with sweets.

317
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:13,470
This was how he came up with the plan,

318
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,170
hiding the murder weapon under the sweets.

319
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,171
What?

320
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:20,070
So he hid the weapon under the Wood Chocolate Cake, am I correct?

321
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:25,070
Right! A piece of wood was used to kill Ms. Hashigaki!

322
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,770
You are a very careless man.

323
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:29,470
You hid the piece of wood that's smaller than your Wood Chocolate Cake

324
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:30,971
in your kitchen beforehand.

325
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,770
Then you brought the wood chocolate to Conan,

326
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,470
with the piece of wood hidden under the tray.

327
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:44,171
You hit the back of the victim's head with it.

328
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,770
Show me the evidence if you say so!

329
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,170
The evidence lies in Mr. Fujino's corner over there.

330
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,970
Conan, would you get the wood chocolates for me, please?

331
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,171
Okay.

332
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,270
Let me help you.

333
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,171
Thank you, Miss!

334
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:11,770
Conan, I'll pay for them.

335
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,070
So give everyone a piece of the Wood Chocolate Cake.

336
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,171
Okay!

337
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:28,570
Sonoko, there's something in the cake. I can't cut it.

338
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,070
What is it?

339
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,771
It looks like there is a real piece of wood in the cake.

340
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,970
Mr. Fujino hid the real murder weapon inside the chocolate cream

341
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,770
and put the cake on the tray.

342
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,970
Then, as he promised Conan,

343
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:47,671
he walked out the door with the real Wood Chocolate Cake.

344
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:56,370
Chief was literally like a witch that's on the wall of this candy house.

345
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,870
She promised me to give me my own store, if I win a contest

346
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,770
and work with her for three years.

347
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,870
So I won a contest with my Wood Chocolate Cake

348
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,970
and worked for three years.

349
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,670
I never complained at all,

350
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:09,970
even if I had to work like a bee.

351
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,670
But as soon as I became popular,

352
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,270
Ms. Hashigaki took back what she said before.

353
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,670
She even say that she would take the Wood Chocolate Cake away from me.

354
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:20,371
Finally, she said there was no promise made between us at all!

355
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,371
I just...

356
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:28,470
Let's talk at the station, shall we?

357
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:30,870
The dream of becoming independent

358
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:32,270
and his Wood Chocolate Cake that was a part of his life

359
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,370
were both taken away by his chief.

360
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:39,170
For him, Ms. Hashigaki was a witch,

361
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:42,270
who was trying to cage and eat him,

362
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,771
just like the one in Hansel and Gretel.

363
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:17,870
"Ecriture."

364
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,371
Oh, no!

365
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:24,370
My chocolate cake!

366
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,470
No! It's ruined!

367
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,870
It's fine!

368
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,470
You still can eat it. It looks same when it gets to the stomach.

369
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:32,670
That's right!

370
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,970
Hey, what are you talking about?

371
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:39,171
Come on! You just need to find another good chocolate cake store, right?

372
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,271
Oh, yeah!

373
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:43,370
I think there's a delicious cake buffet restaurant

374
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,770
beside the train station!

375
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:46,870
-What? -What?

376
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,171
We have to hurry! Come on!

377
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,371
Hold up, Sonoko!

378
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:55,371
Hey... No way!

379
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:02,071
"Next Episode."

380
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,570
If my deduction is correct,

381
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,371
then something going to happen pretty soon!

382
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,670
I won't let anything happen!

383
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:12,771
I will not!

384
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:28,071
Next Conan, "A Lucky Man's Suspense".

385
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:46,070
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:48,070
"Rumor."

387
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,970
The next episode's got a weird title.

388
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,771
The lucky people should be Inspector Megure and uncle, right?
