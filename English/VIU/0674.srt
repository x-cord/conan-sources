1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,580
What seemed to be at first glance a simple request came in

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,780
through the newly opened website of the detective agency.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,880
But the client send a text saying

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,880
he wanted to change the place of meeting,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,080
Pops accompanied by Ran and I

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,380
and his disciple Amuro, set off to the designated place.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,080
But the client doen't show up.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,280
After that we returned to the agency,

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,780
where we were contacted again by the client

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,180
and got ready to leave, but...

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Don't tell me that...

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
What?

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,280
It was thought that the man who came to the detective agency

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,880
and took the woman hostage, thinking he couldn't flee,

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,180
committed suicide by shooting himself.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,280
After Kei finished undergoing interrogation,

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,480
we gave her a lift home.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,180
There were a lot of wiretaps set up there.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,680
As we continued to look for the wiretaps,

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,980
we find something under bed.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
In the meantime, I tagged along with Kei

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,180
when she said she was going out shopping.

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,180
I almost end up drinking juice laced with sleep pills in the car.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,980
But I saw through her scheme in the nick of time,

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,780
and found out her true identity too.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Her name is Serina Urakawa.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,780
In order to avenge the death of her boyfriend,

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,380
Kenya Shono who was shot to death by the three bank robbers,

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,380
she had committed one murder after the other.

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,880
In the meantime, Pops and the others,

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,280
with the help of Amuro were getting close to the truth of the case.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,980
Therefore, they were headed toward the remaining woman

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,880
who was thought to be one of the robbers.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,280
Furthermore, Dr. Agasa and Ai who received contact from Ran,

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
come after us on Okiya's car.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,380
Masumi, who was to join Ran and the others,

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,480
also sped along on her motorbike.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,380
From here on, it's my imagination but...

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,280
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,480
you checked Kei's address

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,580
using Kenya's address book

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,480
and went to visit him, right?

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,180
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in,

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,380
and you were greeted at the door

46
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,980
by a small framed man who was living with him.

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,380
Unluckily, you found his gun,

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,980
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,780
he attacked you in order to silence you,

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,780
but was beaten to death by you instead.

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,380
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,980
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

53
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,580
being made in the living room.

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,380
So, afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,780
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,680
and set up wiretaps.

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,880
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,480
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,880
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,780
So he called the other robber

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,580
and suggested that they take the rest of the money and split.

62
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,780
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

63
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,680
he didn't know where the locker was.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,880
So, Kei Kashizuka

66
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
look for the locker!

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,580
That's why you tried to ambush Kei Kashitsuka

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,080
at the detective agency

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,680
and get information out of him about the other partner.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,180
Is that right?

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,580
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,980
I thought that I'd find out

74
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,080
who that guy was talking with thanks to this phone's call history,

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,180
but he was careful and erased it all.

76
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,980
In that case, we have no choice

77
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,880
but to go see those three women that you called.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,980
Let's start with the closest one to us, Rinko Toyokita's flat.

79
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
The vivid colored memories of summer

80
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,480
solve mysteries all season round.

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,380
It started from a bank robbery

82
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,380
and lead to Bourbon of the Organization.

83
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,980
He sees through the one and only truth.

84
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

85
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,280
His name is Detective Conan.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,570
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"

87
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,367
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

88
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,567
Yeah.

89
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,267
What is it? What a nuisance.

90
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,967
We moved to this apartment today.

91
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,767
Right, Mom?

92
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,967
This isn't much.

93
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,267
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

94
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,967
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

95
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,967
and is normally asleep at this time...

96
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,467
so please be careful next time.

97
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,467
Oh, wait.

98
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:35,467
Something smells good.

99
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,067
-It's omlette! -Hey.

100
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,067
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

101
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,067
Don't you ever come here again!

102
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,067
I wonder if no one's home?

103
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,367
Oh, my.

104
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:55,167
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

105
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,267
We've come to say hello since we moved here.

106
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,767
Oh, is that right?

107
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,767
But, you don't have to do that

108
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:05,067
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

109
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,267
Why?

110
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,767
I won the lottery.

111
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,667
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

112
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,367
Oh, that's right.

113
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,567
I hate to trouble you but will you go throw this away for me?

114
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,167
But, it seems that in this area,

115
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,467
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

116
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,967
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

117
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,867
Thanks for your help!

118
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,167
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

119
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,867
Yes, who is it?

120
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,967
We just moved here today,

121
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,667
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

122
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,467
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:46,267
I don't accept things like that.

124
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:49,667
Hey, what do you do?

125
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,767
I'm a writer.

126
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,967
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

127
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,267
All she eats are beef bowls.

128
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:02,767
Oh, that's right, will you do me a favor?

129
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,267
Could it be that... you want me to take the trash out for you?

130
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,167
So, how about it?

131
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,467
Did you figure out who the robber is?

132
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,067
Yep, of course.

133
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:17,267
But, I can't tell you who it is.

134
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,567
What do you mean?

135
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,967
Why not?

136
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,767
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

137
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:30,267
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

138
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,667
Were there any moves after that?

139
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,467
Go left up ahead.

140
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,667
It's about 5 kilometers straight.

141
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,667
It seems they're moving

142
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,867
but it seems that they walking judging from this speed.

143
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,067
I see. If so,

144
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,467
we'll probably catch up with them in about 10 minutes.

145
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:56,167
I wonder what they're walking around for, though.

146
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,167
I wonder.

147
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,067
Since Conan's doing so,

148
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,367
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.

149
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,767
Ran.

150
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,267
I don't think this would be of any comfort to you,

151
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:19,367
but I don't think any danger will fall upon Conan just yet.

152
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:24,667
If we don't heed the warning of the mail we got a while ago

153
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,167
and decide to report this to the police,

154
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,467
the culprit will need Conan as a hostage

155
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:34,567
to get through the check point if there is any.

156
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:40,467
But, if she's after killing the remaining robber,

157
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,267
it may be that he is messed up in what she's about to do.

158
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,367
Dad!

159
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,867
Yes,

160
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:49,767
that's why the fact that he's in a dangerous situation hasn't changed.

161
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,167
Let's hurry.

162
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,867
Don't be silly.

163
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,867
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

164
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,467
Saying you don't want me to die.

165
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:11,967
Don't tell me that you think I'm planning to commit suicide

166
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,267
after I kill the last of the bank robbers?

167
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,367
Yep! Aren't you?

168
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:20,467
I guess you thought so because you saw the sleeping pill case

169
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,467
in the pocket of my coat.

170
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,867
I had it on me because I find it difficult to fall asleep recently.

171
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:29,467
It's a very small amount, and I could never die using that amount.

172
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:33,567
It came in handy to use on you when I kidnapped you, so I used it.

173
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,167
Although you figured it out and didn't fall asleep.

174
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:41,667
See? Your crimes are too full of holes.

175
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,067
The same goes for those sleeping pills.

176
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:46,867
And the first man that you killed too.

177
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,167
You did okay to the point where you hid him in the suitcase.

178
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,167
But to hide the wiretap together with the corpse

179
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,467
was not a good idea.

180
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:58,167
You probably wanted to hear Kei Kashizuki scream in terror

181
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,967
at finding the corpse

182
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,967
but what you did, was like telling everybody

183
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,467
you wiretapped the entire room.

184
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,667
So, people would get wary on the contrary.

185
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,167
Moreover, you were careless enough

186
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,767
to leave the gun that you struck and killed the man with,

187
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,967
that had its grip stained with blood inside the dashboard of your car.

188
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,167
With the other gun.

189
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:24,067
If you include the gun that you used to kill Kei Kashizuka

190
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,567
at the detective agency,

191
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,267
it would total three guns.

192
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,767
Those guns that were used in the bank robbery,

193
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,067
you found them in Kei Kashizuka's room

194
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,367
and brought them with you, right?

195
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:39,267
After you killed Kei Kashizuka,

196
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:43,367
it was totally wrong for you to switch your cell phone for his.

197
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,567
It seems you erased all the mails

198
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,967
and telephone contacts that were in your cell phone

199
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,567
but all the police had to do was to contact the telephone company

200
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:56,267
to find out who the cell phone belongs to.

201
00:11:56,267 --> 00:12:00,167
Right. Your actions are all just temporary solutions.

202
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,267
They're not planned out at all.

203
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:05,367
You didn't give a hoot about losing memorable mails,

204
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:09,367
photos and telephone numbers of intimate friends.

205
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:12,367
So long as you could avenge the death of your boyfriend

206
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,867
who was killed by the robbers,

207
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,567
you could care less about what would happen in the future.

208
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,167
In other words, it means you have no attachment

209
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,467
to this world anymore, right?

210
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:25,467
That's why I came along with you

211
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,767
in order to keep you alive.

212
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,367
But, I also came along with you

213
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:38,867
because I wanted to find out who the last of the bank robbers was.

214
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:42,467
So, if you promise to do as I say,

215
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,367
I'll tell you who it is.

216
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,767
If my deduction convinces you,

217
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,367
leave that culprit to the police and turn yourself in.

218
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:55,067
Will you promise to do so?

219
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,067
Okay.

220
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:01,667
I'll do as you say, sonny, so tell me who it is.

221
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,367
The last skinny robber.

222
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,067
She was among the three women we met a while ago, right?

223
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:12,167
Yep. You saw too, didn't you?

224
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,967
The image on the surveillance camera of the bank robbers.

225
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:19,167
It was pretty easy because the characteristics

226
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,567
of the skinny bank robber were obvious.

227
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,667
Characteristics?

228
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,667
In that image

229
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:29,567
when the skinny bank robber tried to go over the counter,

230
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,067
she stuck her left leg out first, right?

231
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,167
When people try to go over something,

232
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,567
the first step is taken by the dominant foot,

233
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,567
and most people have the same dominant hand and foot.

234
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,967
She was holding the roll of masking tape with her right hand

235
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,367
and pulling the tape out with her left.

236
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,967
When the other robber fired the gun,

237
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,867
the hand that she stretched over to her mouth was also her left hand.

238
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,767
People try to calm themselves down

239
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:53,967
by touching their faces when they are flustered

240
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,867
but the hand that they use unconsciously is their dominant one.

241
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,667
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

242
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,467
by holding the gun with her right hand.

243
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,067
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

244
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,967
Left-handed?

245
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,640
Then, the culprit

246
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,740
is the first one we visited, Ms. Toyokita?

247
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,740
She opened the door with her left-hand.

248
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,140
If a door opens in that way,

249
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,340
there are times when a right-handed person would use her left hand.

250
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
If the right hand is used,

251
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,240
the hand would come in front of the body and would be in the way, you see.

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,440
She would have to answer the visitor with her body faced sideways.

253
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,840
In the first place, she's right handed.

254
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,940
The handle of the cup that was on the table

255
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,440
was positioned for a right handed person when viewed from the chair.

256
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,340
The handle of the frying pan was on the left

257
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,240
and the spatula was on the right,

258
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,340
which means she was cooking with her right hand.

259
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,440
If the butter knife isn't used with the right hand,

260
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,940
the butter wouldn't stick to the left side of the blade either.

261
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,740
As for the second woman, Ms. Furuya, she's also right handed.

262
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,240
Because she unlocked the door with her right hand.

263
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,340
If so, the third person called Ms. Tegawa is...

264
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,040
Yep! The handle of the cup on the table faced left.

265
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,240
The memo pad was to the left of the telephone,

266
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,140
and this means that she takes notes using her left hand.

267
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,140
The lamp was on the right of the desk

268
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,640
so that her left hand wouldn't cause a shade when writing.

269
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,340
The pen and side table were also on the left.

270
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,840
Besides, she...

271
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,240
In order to get rid of us right away,

272
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
said that she was a writer pressed for deadline.

273
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,840
But no matter how many times you tried calling her,

274
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
her cell phone was switched off, wasn't it?

275
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,540
No matter if she has a house phone.

276
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,440
There's no way that a writer pressed for deadline

277
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,840
would have her cell phone switched off.

278
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,440
She found out that the man had died

279
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,040
at the Mouri Detective Agency through the news

280
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,940
and thought that Mouri had found out

281
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,940
that Mr. Kei Kashizuka was a bank robber.

282
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,440
So, afraid that the police would call her

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,140
after finding her number from his cell phone contacts,

284
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,640
she switched it off.

285
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,140
That's right. I forgot to mention it,

286
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,040
but the main reason I figured that Kei Kashizuka

287
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,940
was one of the bank robbers

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,840
was the large amount of loose change and bills he had on him.

289
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,540
5000 yen in loose change

290
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,740
and 47 1000 yen bills

291
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,140
is just too much for a person to be holding.

292
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,440
That was because the serial number of the bills was known by the police.

293
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,540
So, he shopped for a lot of cheap things

294
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,140
and changed the 10,000 yens in question.

295
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,040
That's the same reason Ms. Tegawa brought home a lot of beef bowl take-outs

296
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
and ate only that.

297
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,940
Moreover, the meal ticket vending machine at the beef bowl shop,

298
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,840
takes 10,000 yen bills.

299
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,340
If she buys take-outs, she doesn't have to stay back at the shop,

300
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,940
thus, won't have to risk her face being remembered.

301
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,540
Unlike convenience stores and brand-name shops,

302
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,940
a lot of those shops are not equipped with surveillance cameras.

303
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,540
Choosing those kinds of shops,

304
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,940
even if they were to find out that the bills in question were used there,

305
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,540
no images would be recorded.

306
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
How about it?

307
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,940
Are you convinced and willing to turn yourself in?

308
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,240
Yes, I guess so.

309
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,340
Out of respect for your deduction,

310
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,040
I guess I'll go to the police.

311
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,640
But your deduction just one part is wrong.

312
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,140
I only took two guns from the room of the man called Kei Kashizuka.

313
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,240
The other one is a model gun that looks real

314
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,740
that I got for self-protection from a gun mania friend of mine.

315
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Of course, there are no bullets for it.

316
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,840
If so, where's the other real gun?

317
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,240
You know too much, so I can't possibly let you go at this point.

318
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
It was you after all.

319
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,240
Just a little while more.

320
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,340
They're around the corner to the right, a little way up ahead.

321
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,440
Okay.

322
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,240
At any rate, let's tell Ran of this.

323
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,140
I don't think so just yet.

324
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,940
We don't know what condition Conan is in yet.

325
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,740
I don't want to think of the worst,

326
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,540
but I don't want to give her false hope.

327
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,640
Oh no...

328
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,340
Let's contact her after we get a hold of the situation ourselves first.

329
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,540
Okay.

330
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,940
And just in case, I'd like to warn you too that.

331
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,540
Even if you find the car that he is riding or the car itself,

332
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,940
don't do anything rash.

333
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,040
Because by doing so, you may put his life in danger.

334
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I know!

335
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,340
I'm not a child, you know!

336
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,640
True.

337
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Come on, hurry and get this car going!

338
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,840
I'll take you to a nice place where there's nobody around!

339
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,040
I didn't realize she was following us.

340
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,840
Damn! My left hand is blocked and I can't fire my tranquilizer gun!

341
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Go on! Quit dilly-dallying.

342
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,740
Did you just hear what sounded like a gun shot?

343
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,340
It's that car!

344
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,940
Conan's in that car.

345
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Then, please contact Mr. Mouri about this.

346
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,540
Not the police?

347
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,840
They're the only ones

348
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,440
who can accurately report what happened to the police.

349
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
If they give the model, color and license plate number of the car,

350
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
and ask the police to set up a checkpoint,

351
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
we can stop them.

352
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
But, what if she uses the hostage

353
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,740
to bust through the checkpoint.

354
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,440
If that should happen...

355
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,040
If that should happen, we'll stop them by force.

356
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,240
What?

357
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
The car with the brat inside is headed up north along Ooishi Highway?

358
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,140
Ooishi Highway, isn't it this road?

359
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
And, what kind of car is it?

360
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,140
A blue compact car. The license plate number is?

361
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,740
A blue compact car...

362
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,240
Hang on!

363
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
You rat!

364
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,040
What?

365
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,740
What is this feeling?

366
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,340
Something is...

367
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,540
It feels like something is closing in.

368
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,340
Don't make that face.

369
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,540
I won't let them get away.

370
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,140
Doc, grab the wheel.

371
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,040
The wheel? What?

372
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
Subaru, just what're you up to?

373
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,140
Mouri Sensei, please keep that seatbelt on the right fastened as is please.

374
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,840
Ran, please unfasten your seatbelt and come here.

375
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,140
What? Unfasten it?

376
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,540
Hey. What the hell?

377
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,440
What's with you guys?

378
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,040
Go for it!

379
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,140
What?

380
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,140
I'm glad! You're okay!

381
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,240
How come she's here?

382
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,640
Conan!

383
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
How come they're here?

384
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,240
Really now...

385
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,140
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,940
I guess you've gained a bit of their trust, but...

387
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,040
You'll keep your word with me, won't you?

388
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,440
Bourbon.
