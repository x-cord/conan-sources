1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,466
"Illustrated Diary" -Ayumi's Illustrated Diary.

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:05,666
Ms. Kobayashi praised my work so much

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,667
for the illustrated diary I drew last time.

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,767
"Hagino Fruits & Vegetables"

5
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:26,666
She said The Youth Detective Squad looked really cool

6
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,067
when solving the jewellery theft case!

7
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,166
So this time,

8
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,466
"Fujioka" -I want to draw a lot more

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,766
"Illustrated Diary" -so that I can be praised even more!

10
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:43,567
The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary Part 2 is starting!

11
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,366
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

12
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,566
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

13
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,366
Ayumi's illustrated diary depicts a case!

14
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,166
What is the truth behind the bomb report?

15
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,666
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,867
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:46,167
"The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary 2"

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,466
It all started

20
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,767
when we were on the way home from a drive.

21
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,866
Conan...

22
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:11,767
What's that?

23
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,367
"What's going on?"

24
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,766
"It keeps flickering... What is it?"

25
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,866
"It's some kind of signal... What is it called?"

26
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,066
"Isn't it a Morse code signal?"

27
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,467
"That's it! A Morse code signal!"

28
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,566
That's a Morse code signal, right?

29
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,066
Yeah, and it keeps repeating SOS.

30
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,166
Good eye, Ayumi.

31
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,566
Has someone been captured?

32
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,066
I'm not sure...

33
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,666
I'll take a look at what's going on,

34
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,367
so you guys wait right here!

35
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,067
Stay alert.

36
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:23,266
He kind of looks like a mythical tiger-carp.

37
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,867
Are you all right?

38
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,966
A bomb!

39
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,866
They've planted a bomb!

40
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,166
What?

41
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,866
We should run right away!

42
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,766
Hey, do you know who planted the bomb?

43
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,266
How should I know?

44
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:43,066
I was only here to deliver some items!

45
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,566
They were talking about the bomb

46
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,866
when they tied me up and left me there.

47
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,967
I heard them!

48
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,166
Dr. Agasa! We need to report to the police right away!

49
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,166
You're right...

50
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,966
Where's Conan?

51
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,867
He can't still be in the building...

52
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,866
Hey, kid, it's dangerous here.

53
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,066
You have to get away!

54
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:26,466
I'll be okay, just leave me alone!

55
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:27,966
I won't let you.

56
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,166
Hey!

57
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,866
-There's no way a kid like you -Let me down.

58
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,367
-can defuse a bomb. -Let me down...

59
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,066
Officer Takagi! And Officer Chiba, too!

60
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,666
You got here quickly.

61
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,066
We received an anonymous report saying that

62
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,666
the light in the office over there

63
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,966
was giving out an SOS signal.

64
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,567
Anonymous?

65
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,666
Officer Takagi.

66
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,266
That's the guy who was captured!

67
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:06,866
Excuse me, but could you tell us what happened?

68
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,566
First, please tell us your name.

69
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,966
Yes... My name is Masaru Danno.

70
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,466
"Masaru Danno (26)" -It's written with the characters for

71
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,466
"group", "field" and "large".

72
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,766
I'm a rider for a motorcycle delivery company.

73
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,866
I was delivering a package

74
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,366
to an office on the third floor of the building

75
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,466
and was just about to get a signature

76
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,266
when a handgun suddenly dropped out of

77
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:30,366
a rude-looking man's pocket.

78
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,467
Why did the handgun drop out of the pocket?

79
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,966
It looked like he was about to take out

80
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,466
a seal from his inner pocket.

81
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,766
I see.

82
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,666
And you were captured

83
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,667
because you happened to see the handgun.

84
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,166
Well, yes...

85
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:48,266
As a result, I was hit on the head from behind and fainted.

86
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:52,466
When I woke up, I was tied up and unable to move.

87
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,166
That's when they said they would blow up the building.

88
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,766
They wouldn't need to kill me

89
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,966
because the bomb would explode.

90
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,366
But why would the culprits say that

91
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,266
in front of you, mister?

92
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,166
Well, I was unconscious until just before that moment.

93
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,566
I see! So you pretended to be asleep.

94
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,266
That's right.

95
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:18,266
And when the two of them left the room,

96
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:20,166
the rest was history.

97
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,466
You kept sending an SOS signal in Morse code

98
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:26,266
by making the light flicker.

99
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,667
While looking like a mythical tiger-carp.

100
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,966
Hey, mister,

101
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:36,866
how did you think of signalling for help using Morse code?

102
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,666
How?

103
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,166
I was in the Boy Scouts as a kid,

104
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:46,566
so the signal I learnt came to mind at that moment.

105
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,166
I see.

106
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,066
By the way, is that your motorcycle?

107
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,867
Yeah, that's my treasured bike.

108
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,666
We just received word from the bomb squad inside the building.

109
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,566
They said they found something resembling a bomb

110
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,366
in the third-floor office.

111
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,066
They heard ticking noises

112
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:09,467
from within a cardboard box.

113
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,766
"The SOS was real..." -"Did they find the bomb?"

114
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,966
"Is the building empty? Did everyone evacuate?"

115
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,266
"There's a bomb squad on the way!"

116
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,766
"Children? Why are they there?"

117
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:25,967
"Where is it? Inside the building?"

118
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,466
Boom!

119
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:36,266
Or that's what you would think.

120
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:41,066
In the box was just a regular alarm clock.

121
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,067
"Ring..."

122
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,966
We searched every nook and cranny,

123
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,866
but we couldn't find any explosives.

124
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,067
What do we do, Takagi?

125
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,166
Let's remove the barricade around the building and retreat.

126
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,466
Some of the forensics guys can stay.

127
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:01,066
-Yes, sir! -In the end, the bomb wasn't found.

128
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,366
But I was sure I heard them say that

129
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,467
they planted a bomb.

130
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,566
Then, if they did plant a bomb,

131
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:13,266
why didn't they kill you?

132
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:16,566
You just say the most unlucky things, kid.

133
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:21,166
Well, in the end there were no bombs going off.

134
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,466
Where were you, Conan?

135
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,867
I had something to do.

136
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,566
Hello?

137
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,866
Yes.

138
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,267
What did you say?

139
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,066
Takagi,

140
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:41,266
the Kaneko Jewellery store in Beika-cho had just been robbed!

141
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,366
What?

142
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,066
-What? -Isn't Kaneko Jewellery...

143
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,966
It's the store that's...

144
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,366
"Hagino Fruits & Vegetables, Kaneko Jewellery" -on our way to school!

145
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:54,566
To everyone's surprise, another robbery has taken place!

146
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:55,966
"SOS Light And Confinement Case" -And so,

147
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,866
the SOS Light And Confinement Case

148
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:05,167
developed in a way we didn't expect!

149
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,966
I can't believe the store was robbed again.

150
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,867
That's unfortunate.

151
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:35,066
I see. So that's it.

152
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,567
Dr. Agasa, could you bring the car here?

153
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,466
Conan, what did you figure out?

154
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,666
You said, "so that's it" earlier.

155
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,166
What I mean to say is that

156
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,866
we were made accomplices

157
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:54,166
in the robbery without us knowing.

158
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,766
-Accomplices in the robbery? -That's right.

159
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,767
"Masaru Danno, written with the words for 'group', 'field' and 'large'"

160
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,866
That Danno guy is probably

161
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,866
"One of the robbers" -one of them.

162
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,366
What?

163
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,066
It's suspicious that he asked for help using Morse code

164
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:10,066
instead of running away without knowing

165
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,566
when the bomb would go off or if anyone would notice.

166
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,466
But don't you think it's strange that

167
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,266
a robbery occurred right when people were worked up over a bomb

168
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,866
that wasn't even there?

169
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,966
You're right.

170
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,766
As a result, many police officers were at that building.

171
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,566
Even the bomb squad was involved.

172
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,366
It was a perfect diversion.

173
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:35,666
But couldn't it have been just a coincidence?

174
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,766
There needs to be some evidence

175
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,466
if we were to doubt his words.

176
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,866
That's what I thought,

177
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,266
but I didn't find it when I was observing him.

178
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,666
What were you trying to find?

179
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,966
A bump.

180
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,167
A bump?

181
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:53,066
He said he was knocked out cold,

182
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:57,666
but I didn't find any bumps or wounds on the back of his head.

183
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,966
If he wasn't hit...

184
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:03,766
Then everything he said was a lie?

185
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,566
In other words, all of us, including the police,

186
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:09,466
were completely tricked by him?

187
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,266
That's not necessarily the case.

188
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,466
What do you mean by that?

189
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,166
I thought he was acting suspicious,

190
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,466
so I planted a tracker on his motorcycle.

191
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,666
What?

192
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,266
So, we must be heading towards...

193
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:26,967
Yes, we're heading where Danno's motorcycle is parked.

194
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,566
Look!

195
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,867
Isn't that Mr. Danno?

196
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,266
He can't be sleeping, right?

197
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,066
Now he has a huge bump on his head!

198
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,166
He's unconscious, but it's okay.

199
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,466
He's still alive.

200
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,766
But why...

201
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,766
They must have had a big falling out.

202
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,866
Mitsuhiko, call an ambulance and the police.

203
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,367
Right.

204
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:02,967
Let's try not to touch anything at all.

205
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:20,867
There it is.

206
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,466
What's that?

207
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,666
A driving recorder.

208
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,766
I couldn't find a key in his pocket

209
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,566
and thought the motorcycle was parked weirdly,

210
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,066
so I thought

211
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,366
he might have parked his motorcycle

212
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,766
where the driving recorder could record the warehouse.

213
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,066
Does that mean he doesn't trust his accomplices?

214
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,866
Yeah, that could have happened.

215
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,767
It shows what happened perfectly!

216
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:52,866
That must have hurt.

217
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,467
I'm fast-forwarding a little.

218
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,967
All right!

219
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,067
It's clear as day in the footage.

220
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,266
Hello, Officer Chiba?

221
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,566
We've discovered the robbers' car.

222
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,667
It's blue, and the licence plate number is...

223
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:18,066
It was heading west from an abandoned factory

224
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,166
at 7 Haido-cho 15 minutes ago.

225
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,167
Got it.

226
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,767
We'll dispatch some people there immediately.

227
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,066
Report from the traffic surveillance system.

228
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,067
The wanted vehicle has been found.

229
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,767
I'm stepping on it.

230
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,566
The wanted vehicle is heading west on Haido-cho.

231
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,066
Nearby vehicles are moving fast.

232
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,767
Secure the target.

233
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,266
Escaping vehicle found.

234
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,466
It's heading north from Dashinomoto Stadium

235
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,267
towards Koume Expressway.

236
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,866
Dr. Agasa, exit at the next interchange!

237
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:26,066
-We should hurry, too! -Okay.

238
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,866
Could this be...

239
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,966
A car chase!

240
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,966
A back-and-forth chase

241
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,766
between the culprits and the police car,

242
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,766
going past the speed limit and burning rubber!

243
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,267
It's beyond even the description of Hollywood films!

244
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,566
And then, a large explosion!

245
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,767
Not only did that didn't happen...

246
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,366
Report from PC 21.

247
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:02,966
The escaping vehicle has been lost north of Hamare Park.

248
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,167
I repeat...

249
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:10,267
Where did the culprits' car go?

250
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,366
We're past the stadium.

251
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,166
Where do we go from here?

252
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,866
The culprits were heading west before they were spotted.

253
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,467
And then they headed north...

254
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,366
Turn left at the traffic light!

255
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,466
-What? -How do you know to turn left?

256
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,066
Since the culprit headed north

257
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,866
the moment they were discovered by the police,

258
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,866
it's unlikely that their destination is that way.

259
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,966
Besides, a pursuer would usually think that

260
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,766
the culprits would shake them off by continuing to head north.

261
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,866
That's why the culprits went in the opposite direction and headed south.

262
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,366
That's what I would do.

263
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,866
I see.

264
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,766
The culprits would also be able to avoid expressways and main roads

265
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,866
that have surveillance cameras installed throughout.

266
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,566
If that's the case,

267
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,567
the culprits will surely pass through this road!

268
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,466
It would be nice if we found the blue car.

269
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,566
Yes, but...

270
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,367
Where are they? Where are the culprits?

271
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,166
There they are!

272
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,566
It's the blue car!

273
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,966
There's no mistaking it!

274
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,966
That's the car in the driving recorder footage!

275
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,766
Well done, Ayumi!

276
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,767
Yeah!

277
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,666
Dr. Agasa, we must not lose the car.

278
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,266
Got it.

279
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,866
This has to be it!

280
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,566
A car chase...

281
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,566
And then, now that it has come to this...

282
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,566
"Transformation Button" -Transform!

283
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,066
Clank! Clank!

284
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,466
Shine!

285
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,966
What's that?

286
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,666
Boss...

287
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,766
Finishing move!

288
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,466
Beetle Straight Punch!

289
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,267
Bang!

290
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,266
Boom!

291
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,366
That didn't happen,

292
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,866
but we quietly followed the car

293
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,267
and arrived at a parking lot next to an apartment complex.

294
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,866
What are they doing?

295
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,266
They're about to steal a car.

296
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,366
This is bad!

297
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,966
We have to stop them!

298
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,266
I know.

299
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,366
Will there be a gun fight?

300
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,367
"Gun Fight"

301
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,466
That's not gonna happen.

302
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,767
But we can't just let them be.

303
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:50,666
Dr. Agasa, call the police.

304
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,766
Okay. On it.

305
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:56,767
And Conan headed towards the robbers.

306
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:03,566
But still, why were we chased by the police?

307
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,066
We pretty much followed the speed limit.

308
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:08,366
Maybe they found out it was a stolen car.

309
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,866
I guess that's right.

310
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:13,166
We did steal that car this morning, too.

311
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,666
Don't whine about it.

312
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,366
We did get all this jewellery, after all.

313
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,966
I know, right?

314
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:23,666
Your plans are always flawless!

315
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,566
But then, why did you betray Mr. Danno?

316
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,966
Why?

317
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,566
Of course, it's because we'd get bigger cuts to ourselves!

318
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,866
Who are you?

319
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,166
I see.

320
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,366
So you were planning to use him as much as you could

321
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,966
before throwing him under the bus from the start.

322
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,366
What?

323
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,066
Why is this kid here?

324
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,966
You're the one who planned this, right?

325
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,566
You asked Mr. Danno to cause some trouble in a neighbouring town

326
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,466
so that you could attack the jewellery store.

327
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:55,766
Kid, I don't know why you're trying to look smart and meddle with us,

328
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,566
but it's time for you to go home and sleep!

329
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:02,866
The plan of attack on the jewellery store was simple.

330
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,966
All you needed to do was to crash a dump truck you stole

331
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,166
at a construction site into the store.

332
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,066
How did you know?

333
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,366
You were watching us, weren't you?

334
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,466
If you were found out by a kid like me,

335
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,867
doesn't that mean your plan failed?

336
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:22,267
How about I tell you why your plan failed?

337
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,466
Let us hear it.

338
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:30,766
It's because Mr. Danno saw through your betrayal of him.

339
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,766
I won't say anything bad of you,

340
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,866
so just give up and surrender.

341
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,867
What do we do, boss?

342
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:42,266
Hey kid, you'd better turn around and go home,

343
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:45,167
or you're going to regret it.

344
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,266
I knew you'd do that.

345
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,866
Dastardly adults like you deserve to be punished.

346
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,566
Take this!

347
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,966
My finishing shoot!

348
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,666
Bump! Bump!

349
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,466
Fall...

350
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:06,066
Yeah...

351
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:09,166
And thus, the robbers were rounded up,

352
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,366
and the jewellery was returned without any problems.

353
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,967
We did it...

354
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:21,466
The other guy who was left at the abandoned factory was also captured.

355
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,666
Just as Conan deducted,

356
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,966
the other culprits hit him in the head from behind

357
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,366
right after the diversion

358
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:31,066
so that they could get bigger cuts to themselves.

359
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,166
"Kaneko Jewellery"

360
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,466
When we returned the jewellery to the store,

361
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,867
the owner was really happy.

362
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,266
Officer Takagi promised to treat us all to a meal again

363
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:46,666
as a reward for solving the case.

364
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,866
Yeah...

365
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,667
It's not my payday yet, though...

366
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:18,766
Officer Takagi said it's not his payday yet, didn't he?

367
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:23,266
I guess we shouldn't expect to be treated to a lot of food.

368
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,666
That didn't happen,

369
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,366
but we were treated to a really fancy meal!

370
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,966
All right then, thank you for the eat-all-you-can meal!

371
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,467
Thank you for the meal...

372
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,767
Seconds, please!

373
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:43,467
It's not eat-all-you-can! You guys!

374
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,266
"Next Episode" -Did you see the culprit?

375
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:48,666
No...

376
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,266
I didn't see anything.

377
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:55,766
I don't understand what he's trying to do at all.

378
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,266
Officer Takagi,

379
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,966
why did he become a police officer in the first place?

380
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:03,366
Why can't you say it?

381
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:06,166
I can't remember what happened.

382
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,167
If my deduction is correct...

383
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,066
Next Conan,

384
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:15,267
"An Unspeakable Alibi"!
