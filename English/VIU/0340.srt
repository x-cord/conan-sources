1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:03,157
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:05,257
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:07,057
Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano

4
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:09,257
leaves the secret of the organization somewhere.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,957
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,857
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,958
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:58,636
"The Hidden Secret in the Toilet (Part 1)"

9
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,735
Do you know?

10
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,736
What?

11
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,235
If you put those on,

12
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:23,136
nobody will ever guess your identity.

13
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:27,836
You fool!

14
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,535
Don't run, Ai.

15
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:39,336
Don't run from destiny!

16
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:49,235
Besides, I gave her my word

17
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,435
that I would look after her if she gets into trouble.

18
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:55,336
Because she's not as tough as she looks.

19
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,835
There's medicine.

20
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:10,635
It seems like a doctor examined me.

21
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,236
But I don't remember that.

22
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,235
The only thing I remember

23
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,336
is that Doc carried me

24
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:19,936
and we left the department store.

25
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:24,635
If I remember correctly,

26
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:25,936
after that I...

27
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,335
How stupid of me.

28
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,835
If they had found me, I would be in no circumstance

29
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,035
to be dreaming something like that.

30
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:50,336
Dr. Agasa wouldn't be dozing off like that...

31
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,436
Doc?

32
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,336
Doc!

33
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:21,935
Hey, Ai.

34
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,336
So, you're up?

35
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,635
Tomato juice...

36
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,435
Tell Doc

37
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:55,135
not to drink canned tomato juice while surfing the Internet.

38
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:58,536
He always falls asleep part way and spills it.

39
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:02,335
By the way, why are you here?

40
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,035
I had this bad feeling, so I came to check on you.

41
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,235
I told Ran that I would help Doc take care of you.

42
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:12,735
Well, it seems it wasn't worth the worry,

43
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,836
so you can go back to sleep.

44
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,535
Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,836
Your rice porridge is ready!

46
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,136
It's not as good as the one at Tamaga-tei, but...

47
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,235
She went to sleep?

48
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,535
That's strange.

49
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,836
I thought she was up just a minute ago.

50
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:35,936
Okay, then. I'll leave this here.

51
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,336
After Ai eats this, tell her to let me know how it tastes.

52
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:44,735
See you. I've got to go and see Sonoko.

53
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,435
Go out the same way you came in.

54
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,735
Go through the basement

55
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,635
and then through the back door, right?

56
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:53,935
You'd better hurry and get the front door fixed, Doc.

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,036
Yeah.

58
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,235
Bye, Conan.

59
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,236
Thank you, Ran!

60
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,236
What's with you?

61
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:07,635
You're really good at fake crying,

62
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:10,635
but you're the pits when it comes to faking being asleep.

63
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,935
What is wrong with you?

64
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,235
She came all the way here to make rice porridge for you

65
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,735
and you ignored her completely!

66
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:19,235
I didn't ask her to do it for me.

67
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,735
I understand you don't care much for people like Ran

68
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:24,735
who like to take care of other people, but still...

69
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,635
She did make it for you,

70
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,136
so eat it before it gets cold.

71
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:35,736
You don't understand anything, do you?

72
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:40,136
Well, it's not that I want you to know either.

73
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:48,435
Anyway, we're lucky that the weekend has arrived.

74
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,935
Yeah. We can't let Ai go walking around

75
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:54,936
when weird guys are sniffing around.

76
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,536
It's hot.

77
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:11,636
It seems like Ai's recovering from her cold too.

78
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:16,535
At this rate, we may be able to go visit.

79
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,836
Ai's father, Dr. Miyano's friend next week.

80
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,035
Hey. What is that about?

81
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,935
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

82
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:32,135
I asked my doctor acquaintances about Dr. Miyano

83
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:34,935
and found out that he had a childhood designer friend

84
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,235
who was with him together

85
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:39,335
in elementary, intermediate and high school.

86
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:43,135
Apparently, this designer helped him bind a book

87
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,735
that he had privately published.

88
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,935
Although the book didn't sell well,

89
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,835
the design was innovative

90
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,035
and was reputed highly among the other doctors too.

91
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:57,535
If we see that person, we may be able to find out something

92
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,235
about the men in black you're looking for

93
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,736
and about Ai's parents too.

94
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:08,136
My father and mother...

95
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:18,235
You're not well at all!

96
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,835
We don't need to go today, do we?

97
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:24,935
We don't know where they're looking out for us, you know.

98
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:29,035
Aren't you the one who wants to go?

99
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:32,435
Well, it's true that I'd like to see him

100
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:33,835
to find out about those guys, but...

101
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,236
Then, stop blabbering.

102
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:39,935
Well, it's true that I'm worried,

103
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,335
but we're fine right now.

104
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:45,935
I'm sure they haven't grasped anything on us yet.

105
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,735
Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,136
If my deduction's correct...

107
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,336
we should all be in the world beyond by now.

108
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,036
"Dejima's Design Office."

109
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,935
Yes. It's true that Atsushi Miyano and I

110
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,435
were childhood friends.

111
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:07,935
But unfortunately, I haven't seen him for the past 30 years.

112
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,035
The last time I saw him.

113
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,235
"Souhei Dejima (54)" -was when he rented this house.

114
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,935
"President of Design Office" -that he inherited from his parents to me.

115
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,636
Does that mean...

116
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,835
this house belongs to Dr. Miyano?

117
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,735
Yes. I wanted a design office,

118
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:26,535
so he said that he'd rent it to me

119
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,535
since he'd be leaving his house empty for a while.

120
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,235
I see.

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,535
I've been renting this house ever since for 30 years.

122
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:37,635
This is where father was born and raised.

123
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:41,535
Then, where did Dr. Miyano live after lending this house to you?

124
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,035
Beats me.

125
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:45,235
He said that he was going to a large research laboratory

126
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:48,535
of a sponsor that approved of his theory.

127
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:51,335
But I have no idea where that is.

128
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,435
-It's those guys. -Yes.

129
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,635
Most probably.

130
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:59,435
And? Did you not hear from Dr. Miyano after that?

131
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:02,035
No, I only received a postcard

132
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,035
saying that he got married.

133
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,735
That person came once when you were out, President Dejima.

134
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:10,035
-What? -Remember?

135
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,635
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -You would go out for walks.

136
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,435
"Designer" -when you couldn't think of design ideas

137
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,935
and would stay out for quite some time.

138
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:19,535
He happened to come by just at that time.

139
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,035
He came along with a pretty foreign wife

140
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:25,135
and a cute, little girl who was about four or five years old.

141
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,935
He seemed to want to talk to you about something important

142
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:31,435
and he ended up spending the night here, then left.

143
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,935
I told him that you might be back soon, but...

144
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,535
Didn't I tell you about it?

145
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,435
No!

146
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:42,435
By the way, his wife's name was Elena.

147
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:45,335
I think his daughter's name was Akemi.

148
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:46,636
My older sister...

149
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,335
Something seemed odd about them, right?

150
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,835
"Tetsuo Imai (52), Designer" -Yeah.

151
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:58,435
His daughter's mischief was really hard to handle.

152
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:02,335
She hid our tools all over the place.

153
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:05,835
She saw how troubled we were and seemed to enjoy it.

154
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,635
His wife remained quiet all the while,

155
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:10,935
so we thought she couldn't understand Japanese,

156
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,135
but later, she spoke in Japanese with her daughter.

157
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,835
Meanwhile, Dr. Miyano kept looking out the window

158
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,035
and seemed to be concerned about something.

159
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:19,435
Come to think of it,

160
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:22,435
a car was parked for some time outside this house.

161
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:25,835
It was a black car with smoked glass.

162
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,235
They were being watched.

163
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,235
Hey, when was that exactly?

164
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:33,735
It was just after we reformed the old house

165
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,335
into an office, so...

166
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,135
I think it was about 20 years ago.

167
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:43,535
Did Dr. Miyano say anything to you before he left?

168
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,135
No.

169
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,235
Nothing that I remember.

170
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:51,135
By the way, what's your relationship with Dr. Miyano?

171
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:54,235
Oh, well. We're both doctors...

172
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:57,135
He's going to finally get married at his age!

173
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,635
But he didn't have the doctor's address,

174
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,035
so he came to ask you for it!

175
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,536
-Right? -Yeah...

176
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:13,235
I'll go buy lunch pretty soon.

177
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:16,335
Okay, get me a hamburger then.

178
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,435
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -You want the usual teriyaki and fish.

179
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,135
"Designer" -with medium-sized french fries

180
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,335
and corn soup, right?

181
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:22,535
What else?

182
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,935
I'll have the same food as the president.

183
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,135
I'll have the same,

184
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:29,035
but add an apple pie and two large-sized coke.

185
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,635
You always drink too much.

186
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,035
That's why you have to go to the toilet so many times.

187
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,436
Sorry, I'm so much like a kid.

188
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,635
Imai, will you please get coffee for the guests too?

189
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,035
Yes, sir.

190
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,435
So, I don't know Dr. Miyano's address either.

191
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,635
I don't want to be rude,

192
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:48,335
but since we have work to do, after you drink your coffee...

193
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,835
Yes, of course.

194
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,036
Akemi dropped by some time ago.

195
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:56,736
She did?

196
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,636
Why...

197
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,375
Do you remember the girl?

198
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,075
The cute girl who came to use the toilet.

199
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,175
She greeted us saying, "Long time no see",

200
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,375
and we were surprised by that.

201
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,776
Was she Dr. Miyano's daughter?

202
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:21,275
What? Didn't I tell you?

203
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,375
I said, you didn't tell me!

204
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:24,676
Sorry!

205
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:30,975
Did that woman really come just to use the toilet?

206
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,575
Yeah. But she did say something strange.

207
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,375
She said she was embarrassed that she came to use the toilet,

208
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,876
so she mentioned not to tell anybody about it.

209
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,776
I wonder who she wanted to keep it a secret from.

210
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:56,976
Hey, wait.

211
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:01,976
There.

212
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,376
You're both going in together?

213
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,575
There's no doubt about it.

214
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,975
Akemi definitely hid something here.

215
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:17,476
Yeah, it's somewhere in this toilet.

216
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,776
But even if she hid something in a small toilet like this...

217
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,576
I'm sure that someone would've found it already.

218
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,475
Yeah. It's very likely.

219
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,475
But still...

220
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:35,975
we might just discover something.

221
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,676
Clues that will shed light on who those guys are.

222
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,276
Hey!

223
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,775
Hurry!

224
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,776
Will you please hurry up?

225
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,175
I guess we'll search again later.

226
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,276
Yes.

227
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,375
Thanks for waiting!

228
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,875
Do you kids want to have some too?

229
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,775
No, thanks.

230
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,175
Hey, did anything strange happen

231
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,175
after that woman came?

232
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,875
Yeah. A burglar broke in.

233
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,075
And it happened twice.

234
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,475
A burglary?

235
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:20,175
Nothing was stolen though.

236
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,375
Is your stomach okay?

237
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,975
Yeah, it's getting better somehow.

238
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:28,176
The problem's the other thing though.

239
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,876
After that woman came...

240
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,575
for some strange reason...

241
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:36,976
For some strange reason?

242
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,376
President...

243
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,176
President...

244
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,075
Was he poisoned to death?

245
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:08,175
Yes.

246
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,675
The victim is Mr. Souhei Dejima, 54 years old,

247
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,975
the president of this design office.

248
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,575
He seems to have been eating his burger for lunch

249
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:19,275
together with the other three employees there,

250
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:22,175
when he suddenly started suffering and collapsed.

251
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:25,875
And who bought the hamburger?

252
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,675
I did.

253
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:30,775
Which means you had the most probable chance

254
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,675
of poisoning the hamburger.

255
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,175
Wait... wait a minute!

256
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:38,175
The president picked the hamburger on his own.

257
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:39,775
Besides, he picked up

258
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,275
the teriyaki burger that everyone else also ordered.

259
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,675
I couldn't have poisoned the hamburger

260
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,775
because I had no idea who would pick up the hamburger he did!

261
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,175
Is that so?

262
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,675
Right.

263
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,475
It could be that the poison was on something

264
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,675
that President Dejima always used.

265
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,475
Where is his desk?

266
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,475
Here.

267
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,775
Whose seat is this next to him?

268
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,675
Mr. Imai's.

269
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:06,875
Then, he would've been able to use the poison

270
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,475
without being noticed.

271
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:12,676
That may be my seat, but...

272
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,475
Before eating the hamburger,

273
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:17,376
the president had eaten some cookies as well.

274
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,575
See that empty cookie packaging

275
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,375
next to the coffee cup on his desk?

276
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,575
I brought that from the kitchen.

277
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,275
Since he asked me to bring coffee for everyone,

278
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,975
I brought his coffee for him too.

279
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,175
I see.

280
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,875
If the poison was on something that the president used,

281
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:40,275
are you saying that he would've died when he ate the cookies?

282
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,675
What's this medicine?

283
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:43,975
It's medicine for constipation.

284
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:45,675
The president had a bad case of haemorrhoids

285
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,075
and used to drink it all the time.

286
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:48,475
I see.

287
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:50,075
However, he would over drink it at times

288
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,775
and get a bad case of the runs.

289
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:54,575
Yes, especially recently.

290
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:58,175
Yeah, he went to the toilet just before eating the hamburger too.

291
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,375
He had a stomachache and ran to the toilet.

292
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:01,775
The toilet?

293
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:05,675
Did anyone go into the toilet before the president did?

294
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:10,475
Well, I went in before I went to buy lunch.

295
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,075
I went in after him.

296
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:15,275
And after me, Mr. Zaitsu.

297
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,975
Then, after that the president went in,

298
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,675
came out and ate the hamburger?

299
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,175
Yes.

300
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,975
In other words, if you had put poison

301
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,275
somewhere around the toilet...

302
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:28,175
You must be kidding!

303
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,475
It's true that I went into the toilet before the president,

304
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,876
but it wasn't right before he went in.

305
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:38,575
Before the president went in, these children went in

306
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,376
right after me.

307
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,475
Conan?

308
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:47,875
And Ai and Dr. Agasa too?

309
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,475
Oh, well, we just happened to come by

310
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,575
because we had some business with Mr. Dejima.

311
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,875
You people sure get mixed up in all kinds of cases, don't you?

312
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,976
You're starting to look like Mr. Mouri.

313
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:05,175
So? Which one of you went in first?

314
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,176
We went in together.

315
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:09,575
What? You used the toilet together?

316
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:12,975
Well, I dropped my loose change somewhere.

317
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,675
I thought maybe it slipped through the space under the door

318
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,175
and rolled into the toilet,

319
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,075
so we looked for it together, right?

320
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,076
Yes.

321
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:25,575
We looked for the thing that Akemi hid from the eyes

322
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:27,076
of the guys of the organization.

323
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:31,275
If so, where could the poison be?

324
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:33,175
Then, why not check all the way

325
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,275
from the work place to the toilet?

326
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,575
From the work place...

327
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,875
To the toilet?

328
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:42,175
After eating the cookies, the president went to the toilet,

329
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,075
went back to the work place, and ate the hamburger.

330
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,975
Then, he collapsed, didn't he?

331
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,775
This means that the poison

332
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,675
may still be somewhere around here!

333
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,175
Because from the time the president collapsed

334
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,275
to the time you came here,

335
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,475
nobody left the work place, took anything out,

336
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,675
threw away or wiped anything.

337
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,875
I see. Let's start checking anyway.

338
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:05,076
Yes, let's do that and check everyone's body.

339
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:15,875
What? There's no poison reaction anywhere?

340
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,875
No. Nothing was found from the toilet, corridor,

341
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:21,375
work place and everywhere else that the victim could've touched.

342
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:22,975
But the strange thing is,

343
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,975
there was a reaction by the right side of the victim's slacks

344
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:28,375
and the place where the belt holes are.

345
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:32,375
The same goes for the victim's left fingertips, his handkerchief,

346
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:35,075
and the wrapper of the hamburger he was eating.

347
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,075
But it was a very small amount,

348
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,475
and it seemed that the victim

349
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,975
touched the wrapper with his poisoned hand.

350
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:44,276
But why was there poison only on his left hand?

351
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,775
I get it! The handle of the coffee cup!

352
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,475
If the poison was put on the handle,

353
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:51,875
he would eat the cookie with his right hand

354
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,575
and poison would go on his left hand when he drinks the coffee.

355
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,375
If so, even if he went to the toilet after that,

356
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:00,475
if he opened and closed the door with his right hand,

357
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:03,575
there would be no poison reaction in the toilet.

358
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,575
In other words, the killer is

359
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,476
the one who brought him the coffee.

360
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:11,676
It's you, Mr. Imai!

361
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:15,576
No, Inspector!

362
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,475
We of course checked

363
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,475
the handle of the coffee cup and the cookie bag,

364
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:22,675
but there was no poison reaction.

365
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,375
Oh, is that so?

366
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:28,875
Besides, the lever to flush the toilet is on the left side.

367
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:30,075
If the poison was on his left hand

368
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:32,575
before he went into the toilet,

369
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:34,475
when he pulled his slacks up and down,

370
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,975
the poison would most likely be on the left side of his slacks.

371
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,175
So, why was there poison on the right side of his slacks?

372
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,176
I have no idea.

373
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,675
Did the president have some kind of habit?

374
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,476
Was he left-handed?

375
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:47,775
The only characteristic I can think of

376
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:51,075
was that he was very neat and loved coffee.

377
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,375
He was neat and loved coffee?

378
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,675
He always wiped his hands first

379
00:21:54,676 --> 00:21:57,275
with wet tissue before he sat at his desk.

380
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,775
It took me 10 years

381
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,575
before I succeeded in making coffee the way the president liked.

382
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:06,275
Did you see any suspicious people watching this house?

383
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,075
No. We were burglarized twice.

384
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,775
But nothing happened after that.

385
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,175
Burglarized?

386
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:15,376
Yes. The burglar broke in through the window.

387
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,675
Ai, don't tell me that the burglary is...

388
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:19,676
Yes.

389
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:22,275
It sure is similar

390
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,675
to the way those guys get rid of their target.

391
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,775
They leave no evidence

392
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,176
and vanish like the fog.

393
00:23:58,276 --> 00:23:59,475
"Next Episode" -The burglary that happened

394
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:02,875
after my older sister visited here was most likely done by those people.

395
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,175
Yeah.

396
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,475
They probably guessed that she may have hidden something here

397
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:08,876
and came to look for it.

398
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,675
No, don't!

399
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,575
It's something you don't need to know about!

400
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,275
If you delve any deeper, you'll really...

401
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:23,875
Next Conan,

402
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:26,976
"The Hidden Secret in the Toilet (Part 2)"

403
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,775
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,975
"Toilet equipment."

405
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,875
A shocking message is left for Ai in the next episode.

406
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:52,476
-How shocking is it? -Shocking enough to make you cry.
