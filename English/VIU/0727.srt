1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,519
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -Parfait...

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:05,119
I'm absolutely sure that...

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:07,519
it's going to be the Tropical Strawberry Parfait!

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,819
No, I feel like...

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,519
it's going to be the gorgeous strawberry chiffon cake today!

6
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,219
Then, here's for the announcement.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,619
The winner of the strawberry battle tonight is...

8
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:27,119
The one who made the Tropical Strawberry Parfait,

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,819
Patissier Shuhei Kurimura!

10
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:33,319
He has successfully defended his title as champion!

11
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,019
My God!

12
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:38,219
I thought that the champion was going to be defeated today!

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,819
It's fantastic, don't you think?

14
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:42,719
He's defended his title for six consecutive weeks now!

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,419
We'll see you again next week

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,319
on Which Sweet Will Win...

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,619
Hey, delinquent girl!

18
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,319
Don't you have to go home?

19
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,419
It's almost 8pm.

20
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,319
I'm just checking the program out beforehand, okay?

21
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,319
Because I'm going to be an audience of this show

22
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,619
together with Ran next week.

23
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:06,819
That's right.

24
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,219
I can use father's connection

25
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,619
if you'd like to come, Mr. Mouri?

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,319
What makes you think I'm going to make an appearance

27
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,119
on such a super sweet confectionary program like that?

28
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,119
Oh well, that's too bad.

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,319
I heard that Yoko Okino may be coming

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,519
as a guest judge.

31
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,619
I would like to go with you,

32
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,319
my lady Sonoko!

33
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,519
He's such a simpleton.

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,419
Will you escort me and the others

35
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:35,319
on your rental car then, Mr. Mouri?

36
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,819
Your wish is my command.

37
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,519
But, what should I do about the one other person?

38
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,219
Five of us have been invited, you see.

39
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,819
Mother has to work.

40
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,219
Then why don't we...

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,319
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,019
are slashed by the light of deduction.

43
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,119
An impossible crime is committed

44
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,219
while the program is on air.

45
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,319
The mystery that is hidden in the box of fruit.

46
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,919
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,919
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,419
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:50,671
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 1)"

50
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:52,271
Huh?

51
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,071
You mean it's okay for me to go too?

52
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,671
Yep, Conan wants you to come at all cost.

53
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,871
Is... is that so?

54
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,571
Yep.

55
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,971
If you're inviting me,

56
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,271
I could never turn you down.

57
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,271
I've got something I want to ask you too.

58
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:12,271
Well, I just hope that when we're in the audience,

59
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,571
we don't stand out too much

60
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,671
that we catch the judge, Mr. Takegi's eyes.

61
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,971
Mr. Takegi?

62
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,871
You don't know him?

63
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,771
He's the big shot of Japan's Patissier Association,

64
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:25,271
the Legendary expert of Sweets, Shoutoku Takegi.

65
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,271
If we catch his eyes, what happens?

66
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,671
Half way through the program,

67
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:32,971
Mr. Takegi picks someone from the audience

68
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:37,271
to try the sweets.

69
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,971
And if you correctly identify the fruit

70
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,071
that is used in the sweets,

71
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,071
you get to eat the winning sweets of that program.

72
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,671
But, if you don't make it,

73
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,271
they chase you out of the studio right that minute.

74
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,271
Is that man called Takegi that strict?

75
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,171
Yep. Although today's champion

76
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,571
won six consecutive wins,

77
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,471
Mr. Takegi's score is always really tough.

78
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:02,171
Well, the challenger's score is even lower, though.

79
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,771
Come to think of it,

80
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,271
it seems that the champion Mr. Kurimura

81
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,571
is going to be opening another branch again.

82
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:13,471
It'd be nice if he opens a branch in Beika Town too.

83
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:14,771
But, don't you think...

84
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,471
there's something suspicious about that champion?

85
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,871
Because even yesterday he coincidentally happened

86
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,971
to bring ice cream and jelly that go well strawberries,

87
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,471
the theme of that day.

88
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,671
What's with you?

89
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:28,771
Are you saying that the champion's cheating?

90
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,971
I don't think he would do such a thing.

91
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,971
Even the TV staff don't know

92
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,171
what the theme fruit will be until the box is opened.

93
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,971
The box is the old looking iron box

94
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,371
that was opened at the start of the program, right?

95
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:42,271
Any TV staff could easily open it

96
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,571
and take a peek, no?

97
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:47,571
But it's made so that you can't do that!

98
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:50,771
Each time, person known as the master of selecting fruit

99
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:54,271
packs a load of the theme fruit into the box.

100
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,271
After the fruit is packed,

101
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,071
the box is locked for the time being.

102
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,971
Then the box is sent to the TV station.

103
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,171
The program director who receives the box

104
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:04,571
then places a different lock on it

105
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,871
and sends the box back to the home of the master of fruits.

106
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:10,071
The master then opens his own lock.

107
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,571
After this the box is sent back to the TV station.

108
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,871
Then the MC who receives the key

109
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:19,071
at the start of the program unlocks the box.

110
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,771
And then for the first time,

111
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,371
we find out what the theme fruit is.

112
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,171
I see.

113
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,871
It's an old code.

114
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:27,871
A code?

115
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:28,871
Before, when communication devices

116
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,571
weren't as advanced as they were now,

117
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:35,071
that's how people used to exchange confidential letters.

118
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:36,271
By using this method,

119
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,171
the people who have the key

120
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:39,971
are the only people who can see the contents.

121
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:41,271
I see!

122
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,371
Even if somebody were to want to look inside

123
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,771
while delivering the box,

124
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,671
they couldn't possibly do that, huh?

125
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,271
By the way, just how are we supposed

126
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,071
to keep from standing out?

127
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,871
There are a lot of women in the audience so...

128
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,471
Why don't you try wearing girlish clothes?

129
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,771
Girlish?

130
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:01,671
Well, but the one who'd stand out

131
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,871
most is that man with the mustache, though.

132
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,271
Oh, Mr. Takegi...

133
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,371
If it's about the fruit that'll be used in tomorrow's show,

134
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,571
I've already finished packing them.

135
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:13,671
Oh.

136
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,171
-"Terafumi Kasuga, age 45" -We had choice fruit

137
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,971
from all over the nation sent to us this time too.

138
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,571
So, rest assured.

139
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,671
Well, I'm going to confirm it then.

140
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,871
Oh, no.

141
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,171
Even for you, Mr. Takei,

142
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,071
I can't show you the contents!

143
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,871
Isn't that what we promised?

144
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,471
Don't worry about it.

145
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,171
It's not the contents of the box that I want to see.

146
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:37,571
-"Shoutoku Takegi, age 69" -It's the key.

147
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,471
I guess it's locked tight.

148
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:45,871
Of course.

149
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:49,871
Are you sure that nobody saw you packing the fruit?

150
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:53,171
Yes. Like always I packed the box alone

151
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,571
in this storeroom.

152
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,371
I carried in boxes that are delivered

153
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:01,771
to restaurants and other businesses as camouflage too.

154
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:05,171
So, I'm sure that even the couriers didn't realize a thing.

155
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:07,471
If so, if anything were to be leaked outside,

156
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:11,471
it could only be from your mouth.

157
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:15,571
Oh, so the box of forbidden fruit

158
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,971
-"Nichiuri TV" -has arrived.

159
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:18,571
Then, let's hurry and lock it up

160
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:20,371
and send it back, Furuya.

161
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,771
Oh, yes sir.

162
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:23,971
The padlock to be used

163
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,071
is in my desk as always.

164
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,971
-"Toshide Taruoka, age 48" -No matter what you do,

165
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,871
don't look inside, all right?

166
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,271
Mr. Takegi just bawled me out

167
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,771
right before going on air during the previous program.

168
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,471
-"Wataru Furuya, age 31" -I couldn't do that anyway,

169
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,571
because it's already locked with another key.

170
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,071
That's true.

171
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,471
They're going through that bothersome method again?

172
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:46,571
If so, Mr. Takegi should pack the box

173
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,171
and lock it himself.

174
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,871
He says that he wants to be surprised too,

175
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:53,071
seeing the contents when the program's being aired.

176
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,771
Well, he's getting old too.

177
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,871
To tell the truth,

178
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:00,571
we have a prospective candidate to replace him.

179
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,371
How about it?

180
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,071
I look a little more girlish, don't I?

181
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,271
That...

182
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,771
What part of you is different from always?

183
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:25,871
I'm wearing cute flower pattern undies.

184
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,871
It's sort of embarrassing, though.

185
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,071
What's the use if people can't see it.

186
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,571
By the way, where's Yoko?

187
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:37,271
She's nowhere.

188
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:38,571
If she's one of the judges,

189
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,571
maybe she's waiting in another room

190
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:41,971
for the sweets to be delivered?

191
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:42,971
Huh?

192
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,371
Don't worry,

193
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,371
she'll be displayed on the monitor.

194
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:51,871
Then, it's no different from watching TV at home!

195
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,871
That...

196
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:57,271
I'm sorry, we'll quiet down.

197
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,471
Excuse me,

198
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,171
but you're the renowned detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

199
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,871
Oh yes...

200
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:05,971
I have something I'd like to discuss with you.

201
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,471
Yes?

202
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,171
We'll start airing then!

203
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:29,571
Five seconds to go!

204
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,571
Four, three...

205
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,671
Welcome to our cooking arena.

206
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,371
Please enjoy a very sweet evening tonight.

207
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,271
Before announcing the fruit for tonight,

208
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,871
I'd like to introduce our two guests

209
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,871
that we have invited over to our arena.

210
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,871
It will be her second appearance...

211
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,471
"Which Sweet Show"

212
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,371
Ms. Yoko Okino!

213
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,871
And the other guest is...

214
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,371
the great detective...

215
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,771
The great Kogoro Mouri Sensei!

216
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,071
What's with this turn of events.

217
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,771
He's substituting for Mr. Takegi

218
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:15,871
and yet doesn't look at all nervous.

219
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,971
Give it your best shot, Dad!

220
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:18,971
Huh?

221
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,371
Nope, the ones who have to give their best shot

222
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,371
are the chefs.

223
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,371
Do you eat a lot of sweets, Detective Mouri?

224
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:29,971
Yes! I have a soft spot for sweet things.

225
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,171
Oh, really?

226
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:36,271
Which means your wife frequently makes you sweets?

227
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:37,771
My wife?

228
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:41,171
No... her's is not edible!

229
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,971
Mom was looking forward to seeing this program.

230
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,771
Don't show it to her,

231
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,371
because it's not live on air anyway.

232
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,371
Hey...

233
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:54,571
Is it true that Mr. Takegi's whereabouts is not known?

234
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,371
Yep. The staff was saying that

235
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,471
they can't get a hold of him at all.

236
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,071
He hasn't come to the studio,

237
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,671
much less to the TV station either.

238
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,871
Oh, look, the box is going to be opened!

239
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,571
Now...

240
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:11,971
Challenger, Patissiere Goa Enokido.

241
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,471
Champion, Patissier Shuhei Kurimura.

242
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,271
We will announce the fruit

243
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,071
that you will be using in its entirety tonight!

244
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:24,371
We'll be using the key

245
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,171
that we received from Mr. Taruoka,

246
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,271
who like always has locked

247
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,271
in the safety deposit box of Tohto Bank...

248
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:36,071
To open this box of forbidden fruit!

249
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,671
A padlock like that

250
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,171
could easily be opened

251
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:43,571
by a person who is good at picking locks.

252
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:44,771
Aside from how it looks,

253
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,971
it seems to be a special lock

254
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:49,071
that has an electronic chip embedded it in.

255
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,371
If you try to pry it open

256
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,371
and stick something into the keyhole,

257
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,071
a buzzer goes off.

258
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,071
I heard that a spare can't be made easily either.

259
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,671
Well, I guess if it were Sir Kid,

260
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,871
it'd be duck soup.

261
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:05,971
Sera...

262
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,571
I have something I'd like to ask you later.

263
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,771
What is it... ask me now.

264
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,371
Okay, then, let me ask you...

265
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,671
Let me show you!

266
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,371
The fruit for today is...

267
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,371
Sera, are you...

268
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,171
maybe like me...

269
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,971
No way.

270
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:44,634
Isn't that Mr. Takegi, the judge?

271
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:45,634
No joke.

272
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,634
Hey, Conan!

273
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:51,634
You stay here!

274
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,934
From here and beyond,

275
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,334
it's our territory.

276
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,934
Our?

277
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:02,134
Hey, sonny!

278
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,734
No good.

279
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,434
He's already cold.

280
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:09,834
Looks to be so.

281
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,734
The cause of death

282
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,634
is probably this wound on the back of his head.

283
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,834
Judging from rigor mortis,

284
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,234
he's been dead for more than half a day.

285
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,534
Huh?

286
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:21,534
On the brim of the box,

287
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,634
there are traces of blood having been wiped off.

288
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,534
Moreover, this...

289
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,134
The blood being wiped off is also seen on the inside,

290
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,334
which means...

291
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,334
He hit his head on the box

292
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,534
when the lid was open and died.

293
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,034
And was packed into the box

294
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:39,034
together with the apples.

295
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:42,134
Is Mr. Takegi really dead?

296
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:46,334
Yeah, so call the police right away.

297
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:49,034
I think it's better to have the audience in the studio

298
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:51,634
wait in another room too.

299
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:54,034
They may have witnessed something, you know.

300
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,334
Then...

301
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,734
Let's have Detective Mouri who is in another room

302
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:59,234
come here too.

303
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:02,834
That would be better wouldn't it, Conan?

304
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,234
Do you know him?

305
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:07,334
He's Mr. Kenzaki, who acts the role of Detective Samonji.

306
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,834
I worked with him on another case before.

307
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,534
Oh... you mean that funny detective?

308
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,334
Funny...

309
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,034
I see.

310
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,834
In other words, inside the box where the fruit

311
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,434
to be used on the cooking program,

312
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,434
the corpse of Mr. Takegi the chief judge of the program,

313
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,434
was packed inside.

314
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:34,534
Mr. Takegi couldn't be contacted for a while.

315
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,834
But, I didn't think that he would've been put in a box.

316
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,934
You mean you started airing the program

317
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,534
despite the chief judge being absent?

318
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:47,434
I, who just happened to be in the audience of the program,

319
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:50,034
was singled out as his substitute.

320
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,534
Inspector!

321
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,534
Why you?

322
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,634
You're not gourmet or anything.

323
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:58,034
It's because I asked the producer to do me a favor.

324
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:02,734
Since I heard that the airing time was closing in,

325
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,334
I thought Mr. Mouri would come forth.

326
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,834
I knew he was going to be at the studio

327
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,134
through the text mail.

328
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,234
Mr. Kenzaki also said that if it were Mr. Mouri,

329
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,534
he would have it easy too,

330
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,034
because he is also an acquaintance.

331
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:15,334
Isn't that right, Producer Taruoka?

332
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,534
Yeah.

333
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:19,334
I thought that if it were the great detective Mouri,

334
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:22,234
it would settle in nicely as part of the program, you see.

335
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:27,034
But, is that rumoured about the key of the box true?

336
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,134
That two keys are used to lock it?

337
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:30,234
Yes.

338
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:33,734
First of all, the food coordinator Mr. Kasuga

339
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:34,734
packs the box with the fruit

340
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,034
that is the theme for the day.

341
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,434
He locks it with a padlock

342
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,134
and sends it to Nichiuri TV.

343
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,434
Then after I receive that box,

344
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,134
I lock it with a different padlock

345
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,434
and send it back to Mr. Kasuga's residence.

346
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:47,934
Then again Mr. Kasuga unlocks the padlock

347
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,034
that he had used at his residence,

348
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,334
and sends it back once again to the TV station.

349
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,934
The MC Kenzaki, at the beginning of the show,

350
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,634
uses the key that he receives from me

351
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,434
to open my padlock.

352
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,034
Here for the first time,

353
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:01,034
everybody finds out what the theme fruit is.

354
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:06,534
Well, this method is one that Mr. Takegi had proposed

355
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:07,934
to make sure that the fruit inside the box

356
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:12,034
would not be leaked beforehand.

357
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,634
Which means...

358
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,534
that the one who could've put the corpse into the box

359
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:19,134
would be Mr. Kasuga who first locked the box,

360
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:23,134
or you, that had the last key.

361
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,334
No way...

362
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,734
I do give the key to the MC,

363
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,434
but I do it while the program is being aired, you know?

364
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:32,034
Until then, the key is stored

365
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,034
in the safety deposit box of Tohto Bank,

366
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,534
and is not in my hands.

367
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:39,634
The padlock is kept in the drawer of my desk,

368
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,034
and the assistant director locks the drawer.

369
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,734
Who is that assistant director?

370
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,734
Mr. Furuya right there.

371
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,034
He always locks the drawer

372
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,334
and is also in charge of taking care of the box.

373
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,934
Which means that he's the one who carries it around too?

374
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,434
Although I do take of the box,

375
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,634
it's not like I watch it 24/7.

376
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:02,234
Carrying the box around is left to the young assistant directors.

377
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:04,734
I just accompany them.

378
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:09,234
Well, there are times that I go alone

379
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,934
to the storage room where the box is kept

380
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:12,634
to check whether the lock had been pried open or not.

381
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,734
Then if at that time,

382
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,234
you sniff the box carefully,

383
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:18,334
wouldn't you be able to tell what's inside the box?

384
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,734
No way!

385
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:20,934
Because to fill the space between the lid and the box,

386
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,434
a rubber packing like the ones

387
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,534
used for refrigerators is attached.

388
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,434
Then the only one left would be Mr. Kasuga,

389
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,234
the first one to lock the box.

390
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,534
Come to think of it,

391
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,334
last night another staff member said that

392
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,834
Mr. Takegi asked for Mr. Kasuga's address.

393
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,734
Then, maybe he went to Mr. Kasuga's home.

394
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,334
Yes.

395
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,034
It's true that Mr. Takegi came over

396
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,434
to my house last night.

397
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:47,634
Just after I finished packing the box.

398
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:51,634
Before the staff came to pick up the box.

399
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:54,634
Mr. Kasuga, what brings you here?

400
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,734
I came because Mr. Takegi called me.

401
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:00,134
He said that he was going to nab the perp

402
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:02,234
who is leaking information about the contents of the box.

403
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,234
He said that he'd expose the perp

404
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,434
while the program is being aired,

405
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,734
so to come and watch.

406
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,734
Then, Mr. Takegi went to your house to...

407
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,834
To check the padlock that I locked

408
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,634
and to make sure that I wasn't doing anything

409
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,834
I wasn't supposed to do.

410
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:21,234
After all, I'm the only one who knows what's in the box.

411
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,934
He seems to have suspected me

412
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,934
for leaking information about the contents.

413
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,734
And, what did Mr. Takegi do after that?

414
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:33,234
He left as soon as the staff came

415
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,934
to pick up the box.

416
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,334
Isn't that right?

417
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:37,534
Yes.

418
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,834
No doubt about it

419
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,434
because two young assistant directors were watching.

420
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:42,734
Hey...

421
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:46,734
There's no time to put the corpse in the box then.

422
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,534
Moreover, what bothers me more

423
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:51,434
is Mr. Takegi's actions.

424
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:55,634
Why was he going that far to check the box?

425
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:59,634
Yeah. It sounds like he already knew that

426
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:02,734
the contents of the box was being leaked outside.

427
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,434
Maybe he just thought it was being leaked

428
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,434
to Mr. Kurimura, the champion,

429
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:09,534
who won for six consecutive weeks?

430
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,634
Huh?

431
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:14,134
It seems that he always brought ingredients

432
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,634
that went along well with the theme fruit.

433
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,234
So, maybe he suspected

434
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:20,034
that Kurimura knew the contents of the box.

435
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,534
Is... is that so?

436
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:23,934
Yes.

437
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,834
At the start Mr. Takegi used to say,

438
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,934
luck was also a talent.

439
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,834
What bothers me even more

440
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,634
is that Mr. Takegi didn't come to this studio,

441
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,034
much less the TV station.

442
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,134
Really?

443
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:40,134
I know that after the arrangement meeting,

444
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:43,134
he left the TV station.

445
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:47,334
If so, where on earth was the corpse

446
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,634
put into the box?

447
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,134
Inspector Megure!

448
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,934
Huh?

449
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:56,934
It seems that last night Mr. Takegi

450
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,734
secretly came to the TV station

451
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:01,034
and mingled among the extras of a samurai show.

452
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,134
What?

453
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:05,934
The director of the samurai show knew Mr. Takegi

454
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:09,034
who asked him to do a favor.

455
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,034
Saying something to the effect that

456
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,334
he wanted to catch his enemy off guard.

457
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,734
I see.

458
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:14,834
He wanted to make it look

459
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,534
as if he wasn't at the TV station

460
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:20,034
and wanted to try catching the perp in the act.

461
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:23,134
Mr. Takegi always wore a kimono,

462
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,434
so it probably would've been easy for him

463
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:26,334
to mingle among the extras.

464
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:29,234
If so...

465
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,534
It's very likely that Mr. Takegi was hiding

466
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,534
in the storeroom where the box was stored,

467
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:36,334
ambushing the perp.

468
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,234
Why?

469
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:48,834
There were traces of blood being wiped off

470
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:51,834
by the area where the lid and box match.

471
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,034
That means that the box

472
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,534
was at the scene of the crime, no?

473
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,534
True.

474
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,034
I see.

475
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,634
That's where Mr. Takegi was killed.

476
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,434
By the perp...

477
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,734
Who secretly opened the box.

478
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:40,934
-"Next Episode" -The suspects were narrowed down

479
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,234
to three people but...

480
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:46,134
Who on earth is the perp?

481
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,534
To begin with, the method of how the padlock was opened

482
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:49,134
is a mystery.

483
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:53,534
I see, so that's the story.

484
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,534
Then, the earlier the better.

485
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:59,234
Huh? Start what?

486
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,134
Well, it's just...

487
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:04,334
a little magic show.

488
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,734
Next Conan,

489
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:09,734
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 2)"
