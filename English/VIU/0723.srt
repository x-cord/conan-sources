1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:04,975
In order to kill time until the cake arrives at Doc's house,

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:08,075
we decided to play soccer in the park.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,775
Partway through the game, we chased Tai,

4
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,475
a cat that has its territory in the vicinity of coffee shop Poirot,

5
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:15,075
and end up being locked up in a refrigerated compartment

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,175
of a courier truck.

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,675
Furthermore, since Haibara's handmade sweater unravels

8
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:25,075
and she ends up being improperly dressed,

9
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,675
not being able to get off the truck, we were locked inside.

10
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,175
While we were doing this and that's,

11
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,475
we discover a man's corpse

12
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:33,675
in one of the cardboard boxes of the truck.

13
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,775
We tried to contact the police using Mitsuhiko's cell phone,

14
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,575
but it runs out of battery.

15
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:42,275
So then we tried to get in contact somehow with people outside

16
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,875
by using the things we had on hand.

17
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:49,375
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

18
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,275
candy and a cotton swab.

19
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:55,775
-How about you, Genta? -I've got...

20
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,175
Band-aid, a chocolate bar,

21
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,675
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

22
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:01,875
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

23
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,075
I have...

24
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:07,375
A memo pad, a ball point pen to go with it,

25
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:11,075
a handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

26
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,975
If I remember correctly, this cat...

27
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,075
I get it! There's a way...

28
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,375
What? If you came up with something,

29
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,975
tell us about it.

30
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:26,575
Huh?

31
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,775
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

32
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:31,775
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

33
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:34,875
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

34
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,275
So, the next stop would be?

35
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,075
The fifth district?

36
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,675
Right.

37
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:43,775
The territory of this cat, Tai.

38
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:46,475
The fifth district is where he goes to beg for food

39
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:48,775
at coffee shop Poirot.

40
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,375
I see! You're going to make Tai go

41
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,475
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

42
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,275
If we stick it in between its collar,

43
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,875
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

44
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,675
Let's do it!

45
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:00,975
Yeah.

46
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,675
But...

47
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:06,575
But, if those two men catch Tai

48
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,575
and see the paper attached to its collar...

49
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,975
I've already figured that part out too.

50
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,775
Huh?

51
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,975
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

52
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,375
even if they were to see it.

53
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,375
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

54
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,375
are slashed by the light of deduction.

55
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,875
The code that divides the fate of the Detective Squad.

56
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,075
Where will the code memo be delivered to?

57
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,675
He sees through the one and only truth.

58
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,575
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

59
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,575
His name is Detective Conan!

60
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:19,176
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 2)"

61
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,176
A code?

62
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,376
Listen.

63
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:29,276
The taxi receipt that Mitsuhiko had is thermal paper.

64
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:30,676
Words are written not by ink

65
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:34,076
but by changing the color of the words to black using heat.

66
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,876
On the surface of the thermal paper,

67
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,276
there is a chemical that becomes the base of the color black

68
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:41,476
and an acidic chemical called color former.

69
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,376
This color former melts with the heat

70
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,576
and reacts to the other chemical

71
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,876
making the color black emerge.

72
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:53,376
The ammonia that is in the anti-itching ointment that Genta had

73
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,376
is alkaline and neutralizes acid.

74
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,276
Putting this on this cotton swab,

75
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,176
and tracing the top part of the letter A

76
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:03,876
in the word Card that is written on the receipt...

77
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,776
The letter A changed to the letter O!

78
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,876
Really!

79
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,776
You're a genius, Conan!

80
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,176
Next...

81
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:17,576
From this word Card Purchases,

82
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,276
erase a part of the letter A,

83
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,776
and the letter D in the word Card,

84
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:21,976
then from the word Purchases,

85
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:25,376
erase the letters U, R, C, H, A

86
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:28,076
and the last letter S...

87
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,676
This results in the word Corpse

88
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,476
which means dead body.

89
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,276
And by strategically erasing part

90
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,576
the card number and phone number that are displayed below,

91
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:41,576
we can inform people that a corpse is inside

92
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:45,176
and the license plate number of this refrigerated vehicle.

93
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,176
Conan, you're terrific!

94
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:49,876
Then we fold this

95
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,376
and stick it between Tai's collar.

96
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,676
This way, even if Tai is caught by the men

97
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,976
and they notice this receipt,

98
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:58,976
they'll probably think it's a misprint,

99
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,176
or that it scraped against something

100
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:02,976
and the letters rubbed off.

101
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,076
I see.

102
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,176
This is perfect.

103
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,976
Just as expected of you.

104
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,176
Rats! The car's going to stop!

105
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:13,576
Listen Tai.

106
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:16,376
Whether we make it or not depends on you.

107
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,976
Make sure you succeed this mission, okay?

108
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,476
A cat...

109
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,776
A cat's in the refrigerated compartment?

110
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:34,776
It probably snuck in when you left the door open.

111
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:41,076
So, the cry that I heard a while ago was this cat's.

112
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,276
Huh? There's a piece of paper by its collar.

113
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,376
Huh? A receipt?

114
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,576
-What? -Oh no.

115
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:52,676
Hey...

116
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,676
Heck! It got away.

117
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:58,676
Never mind the cat.

118
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:00,076
Yeah.

119
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:07,076
Let's leave the rest up to Tai.

120
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,076
Right...

121
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,176
Hey...

122
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,776
If that cat's going to Poirot,

123
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:16,176
that code's going to be seen by him too?

124
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,276
Yeah, to put it more accurately,

125
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:21,076
I made that code to show it to him!

126
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,476
I'm sure that he'll get the message right away,

127
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,476
because he's Bourbon,

128
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,976
a member of the organization of the men in black.

129
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:32,476
"Poirot Coffee"

130
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:36,476
Oh, Tai. You're late today.

131
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,576
Enjoy to your heart's content.

132
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,976
What's this?

133
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:50,976
There's something attached to the collar.

134
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,876
A taxi receipt?

135
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,576
Azusa.

136
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,676
The shop master's calling you.

137
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,176
Thank you.

138
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:02,476
That's right, you're a detective aren't you, Amuro?

139
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,476
Huh? Yes, I guess.

140
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:07,076
Then, would you have any idea what this is?

141
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,176
What was that?

142
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,276
Oh, well, it was nothing really.

143
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,076
Is that so?

144
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,176
It's cold.

145
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,976
That's the last for the seventh district of Beikacho.

146
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:35,076
Make sure they remember your face and name, now.

147
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:37,076
Okay.

148
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:39,676
We're just about to return to the second district

149
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,576
to deliver a time-specified box.

150
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:45,576
We can return the corpse to its home in the first district.

151
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,976
Hey, Conan.

152
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,976
It's been a while since the cat left,

153
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,276
but nobody's coming to rescue us.

154
00:08:57,276 --> 00:09:00,376
Maybe that code was too difficult after all?

155
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:05,276
Or, maybe the paper with the code on it came off partway.

156
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:08,176
So, what are we going to do?

157
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,476
The boxes to be delivered are decreasing

158
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,876
and we'll have no place to hide anymore.

159
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,376
-Huh? -True!

160
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:23,376
Hey, can't you do something about that twosome

161
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,576
using your tranquilizer gun or your Super Kick shoe?

162
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:29,776
I thought about that, first thing

163
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,876
but the battery's nearly dead

164
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,976
and the voltage has gone down because of this cold,

165
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,676
so it won't budge an inch.

166
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,576
Mitsuhiko, are you okay?

167
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:42,476
You've been quiet for a while, but are you okay?

168
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:43,776
Yes.

169
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:47,776
It seems I've somehow managed to overcome the cold.

170
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,376
I've stopped shivering too.

171
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,876
Hey! That's bad!

172
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:59,276
Mitsuhiko...

173
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,576
He's experiencing disorientation of the brain

174
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:03,376
due to hypothermia.

175
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:06,276
Moreover, his fingertips are turning purple

176
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:08,176
and he's on the verge of getting frostbite.

177
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,376
No joke!

178
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,676
Mitsuhiko lent his jacket to Haibara

179
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:14,876
and was only wearing a t-shirt.

180
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,376
Mitsuhiko!

181
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,976
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

182
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,576
Get a hold of yourself!

183
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,007
Mitsuhiko...

184
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:26,445
Huh? The words on the taxi receipt were erased?

185
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:30,045
Is that what you were about to show me a while ago?

186
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,245
Yes.

187
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:36,345
If I remember correctly, the letters between COR, P, SE were erased,

188
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,245
so I thought it was a misprint.

189
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:43,445
Corpse...

190
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,745
Dead body.

191
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,045
Who knows that the cat comes here ever day

192
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,645
to beg for food?

193
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,145
Since it started coming around quite recently,

194
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:56,945
the ones who know are the shop master, you and I.

195
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,445
And, Conan...

196
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:03,445
Conan Edogawa knows too?

197
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,845
And, when I took the receipt, I touched the collar,

198
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,945
but it seemed to be pretty cold.

199
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,345
About the receipt,

200
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,045
if I remember correctly, it blew over that way, didn't it?

201
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:24,545
Yes? You mean you're going to look for it?

202
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,645
Please tell the shop master that I suddenly started feeling sick,

203
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,245
so left for home early.

204
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,345
And also that he doesn't have to pay me for today.

205
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:32,445
Oh, okay.

206
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,745
Judging from the velocity and direction of the wind

207
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,045
and making a simulation taking into consideration

208
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,945
the position of the buildings around here,

209
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,745
I could read the flow of the wind,

210
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,345
and can probably narrow down where it flew off to.

211
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,845
Mitsuhiko!

212
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:54,245
Please... Mitsuhiko, get up!

213
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,945
Mitsuhiko!

214
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,145
He got up!

215
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,445
I...

216
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,745
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:05,845
Huh?

218
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,245
That you're going through this just because of me.

219
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,645
Stay still. I'll warm you up right now.

220
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:15,745
Okay, thank you so very much.

221
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:18,045
But, with all of you in that state,

222
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,545
we could never run for it even if we wanted to.

223
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:24,645
Darn, we were supposed to be eating delicious cake by now

224
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,345
at Doc's house.

225
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,045
He said it was cake coming from a cake shop in Yokohama.

226
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,645
Yokohama?

227
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,445
Is the cake that's supposed to arrive at Doc's house

228
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,245
from a shop in Yokohama?

229
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:37,045
Yes, it seems he specified the time of delivery

230
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,245
to match the time we would be there.

231
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:43,245
But, today we were able to make it back early from school.

232
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,345
Those guys were saying a while ago

233
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,045
that they would be returning to the second district

234
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,445
to make a time-specified delivery.

235
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,945
Conan, if you touch it too much,

236
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,045
they'll find out!

237
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:57,745
I found it.

238
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:00,145
The cake that's supposed to be delivered to Doc's house.

239
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:03,145
Oh! Are we eating it now?

240
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:06,745
Idiot. We're going to put a message in it.

241
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,245
Huh?

242
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,045
By using the ball pen that Mitsuhiko had,

243
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:13,845
and Ayumi's cotton swab.

244
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,645
If you're planning to write something on the box,

245
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,045
I don't think you should, Conan.

246
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,545
If the two men find out...

247
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,945
Besides, it'll work only

248
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:27,245
if Doc sees the message right away.

249
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,045
Don't worry, he'll notice it right away.

250
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,845
We're not delivering it to Doc.

251
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:34,845
Huh?

252
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,845
Just as I thought. It was around here after all.

253
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,845
The number that is displayed at the bottom of the word Corpse

254
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,045
is most likely the license plate number.

255
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,445
If the cat's collar was cold,

256
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,845
the thing thinkable is a freezer vehicle,

257
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,545
but vehicles that are used for special purposes like this,

258
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,745
have license plate numbers that begin with the number eight.

259
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,845
But this isn't an eight number.

260
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:08,745
Which means, it's mostly likely a refrigerated courier truck.

261
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,545
With all this information so far...

262
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:15,745
Huh? Where's the Kudo residence?

263
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,145
Huh, Kudo?

264
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:19,545
What're you talking about?

265
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,845
The time-specified delivery

266
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,445
is for the Agasa residence, isn't it?

267
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,145
But, look! At this delivery slip.

268
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,145
Huh?

269
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,245
Before the name Agasa,

270
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,945
it says care of the Kudo residence.

271
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:34,345
Strange, it doesn't say so on this side.

272
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,845
Oh! This house seems to be it.

273
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,345
Yes.

274
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:44,945
Cheeta Courier.

275
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:48,345
Is there a Mr. Hiroshi Agasa there?

276
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,545
Mr. Agasa lives next door.

277
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,245
Well, I came to deliver a box

278
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:57,245
that says Mr. Hiroshi Agasa care of the Kudo residence.

279
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:02,645
I remember, it's cake, isn't it?

280
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,245
Since he's in the room next door

281
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,445
and his hands are tied right now,

282
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,045
I'll take it.

283
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,145
What? You wrote in care of the Kudo residence

284
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,745
before the name Dr. Agasa?

285
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,545
And with a ball point pen too?

286
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,945
Yeah. So, the box is supposed to be delivered not to Doc,

287
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:24,945
but to Subaru who is next door at the Kudo residence.

288
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:30,845
And? It's okay that he's going to receive the box,

289
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,245
but how did you relay to him this crisis we're facing?

290
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,945
Think about it.

291
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,645
I'm the only one in this world

292
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,845
who could write an address like that, right?

293
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:44,045
Besides if you take a good look at the font and its color,

294
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,545
Subaru would be able to tell right away

295
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,645
that the words have been added on at a later time with a ball point pen.

296
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:52,345
He'll also see through that something like

297
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:54,145
that can only be done

298
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:57,345
from inside the back compartment of a courier truck.

299
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,845
I see.

300
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,645
That's amazing.

301
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:04,045
Well, just in case, I wrote down the circumstances

302
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,445
on that delivery slip too.

303
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,045
Huh? But, doing something like that

304
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:10,545
would give us away right away!

305
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:11,945
Don't worry.

306
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,545
Because I wrote it after taking the cotton off this swab.

307
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:15,645
Huh?

308
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,245
You could never write with something like that!

309
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,845
That's what you think.

310
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,845
The delivery slip is made of several layers of paper

311
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,445
which includes a copy for the sender

312
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,945
and an item label.

313
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,745
If you write on the very top slip,

314
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,845
all the papers under it will be carbon copied.

315
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:37,445
So if I pull out the item received slip that the deliveryman would take out

316
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:41,045
after having it signed by the recipient

317
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,545
and write from on top of it,

318
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:47,145
then put the item received slip back together with the delivery slip

319
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:49,545
nobody will notice what I have written

320
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,845
on the now bottom-most slip, the recipient's copy,

321
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,345
until Subaru flips the item label over.

322
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:59,545
Then, are you saying that those two men

323
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:02,045
are being beaten up by Subaru now?

324
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,545
No, if I know Subaru...

325
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:10,445
Hey, why are opening the door again?

326
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:11,845
The one I delivered the box to a while ago

327
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,445
asked me to collect a box from him.

328
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:17,345
Well, since it's a small box, it's okay, right?

329
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,145
I guess so.

330
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,345
Hey...

331
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:28,545
Conan.

332
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,645
Just as I thought.

333
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:37,445
A cell phone?

334
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:38,845
I see.

335
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:42,145
In this situation, that would be the best weapon.

336
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,445
Yeah.

337
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,945
In order to safely yet surely nab them,

338
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:50,945
it would be best to relay this information directly to the police myself.

339
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,445
No, you're not.

340
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:59,445
Since the position of the boxes were slightly moved from a while ago,

341
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,545
I decided to check,

342
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:04,245
and found all you petty thieves aside from that cat.

343
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:07,745
More so, there are five of you.

344
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,645
I... I told you that...

345
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,545
I heard voices of children.

346
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,245
Yeah, sorry.

347
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,845
But, what stupid kids,

348
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,445
all they had to do was call the police right away.

349
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,845
And just what are you going to do about these kids?

350
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,145
What else?

351
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,945
After we take their cell phone away,

352
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:29,645
we'll lock them up in here till they freeze to death.

353
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:33,145
If we line the bodies of the kids next to the man,

354
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,445
it's sure to be a cold case difficult to solve.

355
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:40,745
After all, we and the kids have no connection to each other at all.

356
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,745
I guess so.

357
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,945
Excuse me! Since this alley is small,

358
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,045
could you yield the way please?

359
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,345
I don't want to hurt you or the car, you see.

360
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,145
-Oh... -Right away.

361
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,845
Detective Amuro!

362
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,945
Help!

363
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:05,845
What're you guys doing

364
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,945
in a place like that?

365
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,545
No... well, this is you see...

366
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:12,545
You... do you know these brats?

367
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:15,045
Yes, I do.

368
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,045
Now that you've witnessed this, I've got no choice.

369
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,145
If you don't want me to kill the kids,

370
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:22,245
you get inside the refrigerated compartment too.

371
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,545
I told you, didn't I?

372
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:30,845
To yield the way

373
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:32,545
because I didn't want to hurt you.

374
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:38,845
Would you like me to take you on too?

375
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,045
No...

376
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,445
All right...

377
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:51,045
Okay, Conan, report this to the police.

378
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,345
Okay.

379
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,445
But, you're really something.

380
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:04,145
You saw the code on the receipt and came, right?

381
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,345
Huh? A receipt?

382
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:08,745
If you're talking about the queer receipt

383
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,345
that was on the cat's collar,

384
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,145
it was blown away by the wind

385
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,645
and I couldn't find it.

386
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,545
-Huh... -I just happened to pass by here.

387
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:18,845
Is that all?

388
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:21,445
Then, would you like to have cake over

389
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:22,945
at Doc's house too, Mr. Detective?

390
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:27,845
So this is the rumored Dr. Agasa's place.

391
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,245
That...

392
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:33,845
But, I don't think so today.

393
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:36,745
I've got other things to attend to besides.

394
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,245
Please give my regards to Dr. Agasa, will you.

395
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,845
I see.

396
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,945
What a catastrophe it was.

397
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,045
I was so cold,

398
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:23,145
that I thought I'd be frozen stiff.

399
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:26,145
On top of that, Mitsuhiko fainted too.

400
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,445
What?

401
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,745
But, he came to right away

402
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,845
after Ai warmed him up, right?

403
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,545
Thanks for that.

404
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:37,645
But, the culprits were caught, weren't they?

405
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:38,645
Yep!

406
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:41,045
Amuro who is part-timing at Poirot,

407
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,645
beat the culprits up, you see.

408
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,845
Amuro did?

409
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,345
-Yes! -He was awesome, wasn't he?

410
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:50,045
Yeah.

411
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:53,345
Never mind that. Let's eat the cake...

412
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:55,945
Oh! That's right...

413
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,645
I forgot the main thing.

414
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,545
Cake...

415
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:05,045
It's an exclusive Christmas cake on sale

416
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,945
for a limited time only from a cake shop in Yokohama.

417
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,845
Remember this when you eat it.

418
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,445
Here goes...

419
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:23,145
What's this?

420
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:29,545
That's a limited time only cake, right down the drain.

421
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:31,845
Come to think of it, those culprits were saying that

422
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,445
they would deliberately drop the boxes they deliver,

423
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,545
in order to have their faces remembered.
