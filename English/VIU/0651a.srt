1
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,966
A girl detective?

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,866
Is she sniffing about around you?

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,166
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,266
Her name is Masumi Sera.

5
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,966
It seems that she's been living in the States

6
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,366
for the past three years with her parents, though.

7
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:18,366
And she's come back to Japan alone this time.

8
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,666
And, did you use Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of that girl

9
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,366
and solve a case?

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,066
Sort of.

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,066
I kind of had no other option.

12
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,266
Don't tell me that girl

13
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:31,666
is one of the members of the you-know-what organization.

14
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,866
Oh, no. I don't think so.

15
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,766
But...

16
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:39,766
I can't help feeling that I've met her somewhere before.

17
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:40,866
Really?

18
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,266
Quite frustrating.

19
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,666
Okay!

20
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,366
I've got some things to do there too

21
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,566
so I guess I'll go take a look at what she looks like!

22
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,066
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,866
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,366
Today, we spend 60 minutes with Heiji!

25
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,266
A serious deduction battle!

26
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,766
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,566
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,066
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:49,402
"Conan vs. Heiji"

30
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,902
"Deduction Battle Between the Detectives of The East and West"

31
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,455
What're you doing?

32
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,255
Acting clearly like a suspicious person or country bumpkin!

33
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:11,655
I can't help it!

34
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:14,655
The curry packet that mother asked me to buy for her

35
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,555
is sold exclusively only at family restaurants in Tokyo.

36
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,955
You don't have to look for it now, do you?

37
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,155
Why not look for it later?

38
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,455
But, when we went to Nagano,

39
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,755
I ended up forgetting to buy Shinshu Miso too, you know?

40
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,755
I don't want to miss the chance this time.

41
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,755
I'm getting off, off here, let me off!

42
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,055
What's up?

43
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,955
I found the family restaurant!

44
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,555
I'm going to stop by and get it,

45
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,955
so you go on ahead to Pops Kogoro's place!

46
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,155
Driver, let me off, quickly!

47
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,555
I mean this is not a taxi, you know.

48
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,655
What makes you think that a bus can stop wherever you want it to.

49
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,855
Hey, Kazuha.

50
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:57,455
See you, Heiji!

51
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,355
Oh, hey, wait.

52
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,255
I tell you, that girl.

53
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:07,055
Huh? Are Heiji and Kazuha coming here?

54
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:10,255
Yes, I got a call last night.

55
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,355
I wonder what they're coming here?

56
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,855
Could it be a case or something?

57
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:17,155
I wonder. He said he'd tell me about it when he gets here.

58
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,255
He was also saying something about curry too.

59
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,655
Curry?

60
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:21,755
You mean, Hattori?

61
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,055
Who'd you say did a gorgeous hat trick?

62
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:28,555
Ms. Sera.

63
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,755
The son of the head of the Osaka Prefectural Police Station, eh?

64
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,955
And a high school detective too!

65
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,255
Why, that's fantastic!

66
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:41,455
Yes, and his name is Heiji Hattori!

67
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:45,355
According to Hattori, it seems that people refer to him side by side

68
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:47,555
as Hattori of the West and Kudo of the East!

69
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,055
So, he's Kudo's rival!

70
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:53,155
But, they seemed to have battled only in the beginning

71
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:57,555
and now they seem to be cooperating with each other to solve cases.

72
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:01,355
In other words, they are full fledged when they work together.

73
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,455
They cannot come close to the ranking alongside

74
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,755
with Japan's greatest detective,

75
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,955
the Sleeping Kogoro, you see!

76
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:13,255
The Sleeping Kogoro is also two working together, you know?

77
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:14,455
And?

78
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:17,055
Why is this boy coming here for?

79
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,055
I don't know.

80
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:21,155
He said he'd tell us when he gets here.

81
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,255
He's probably going to

82
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,755
bring some complicated case along with him again.

83
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:25,855
I hope they cooperate nicely,

84
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,655
the west and the east detectives and solve the case.

85
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:31,455
East vs. West?

86
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,555
If you were to be honest,

87
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:36,055
which of the two are renowned detectives?

88
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:40,755
Oh, I think they are equal.

89
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,755
But...

90
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:44,155
if I had to make a choice,

91
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,155
I think that the detective of the East.

92
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:46,355
It's the West!

93
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,555
I, Heiji Hattori, the high school detective of the west

94
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:52,155
is way above, I tell you, idiot!

95
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,355
Saying what you like,

96
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,355
thinking that I'm not going to say anything, I tell you.

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,855
You mean you were eavesdropping.

98
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:00,155
And? Where's the girl detective

99
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:05,555
that's suddenly appeared recently sniffing around about Kudo?

100
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,255
She's right here!

101
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,955
This is Masumi Sera!

102
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:11,355
It's not that I'm sniffing about or anything, though.

103
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,955
You're a girl?

104
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:18,355
But, for a girl, your boobies are sort of a bit teeny-weeny?

105
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,455
Well, it's scheduled to pop out

106
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:23,355
and get bigger from now on, you see!

107
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,455
Well, mom was seem to have been skinny too,

108
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,755
but seemed to have enough breast size, so I'm not worried, though!

109
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,155
Right, Ran?

110
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:33,955
I've never met her though.

111
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,455
By the way, where's Kazuha?

112
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:38,155
Wasn't she supposed to come with you?

113
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:41,355
Yeah, she got off the bus to go shopping.

114
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,455
Kazuha's mother seems to be hooked on the curry packet

115
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:48,155
that she received as a gift previously.

116
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,255
Moreover, it seems to be curry that

117
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,755
you can only buy exclusively at family restaurants in Tokyo,

118
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:55,755
that her mother asked her to buy it for her while she's here.

119
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:58,855
She happened to find that family restaurant on our way here.

120
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:01,155
So, she's coming here after dropping over there?

121
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,355
Then, why did you come here, Heiji?

122
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:07,155
Well, the fact is...

123
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:08,955
Oh, sorry.

124
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,455
It's from Kazuha.

125
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,555
What is it, Kazuha?

126
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,755
Did you already buy the curry?

127
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,055
Help, Heiji!

128
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:18,355
What's up?

129
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,955
Didn't you go to the family restaurant?

130
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,355
I'm at that family restaurant but...

131
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,455
there's great commotion here

132
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,655
because somebody seems to have died in the restroom!

133
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,655
Somebody died?

134
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:31,855
Is it a homicide?

135
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:34,355
I don't know yet.

136
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:38,155
A strange foreign man told us not to leave the store,

137
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,455
so I can't go out.

138
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:43,055
Okay! I'll be right over, so you wait there!

139
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:45,855
So, I guess I gotta go.

140
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,755
Okay, so why don't we do this?

141
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,955
How about deciding which is better,

142
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:55,855
the West or the East, with this case?

143
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:58,455
Of course, you work on your own, Heiji

144
00:07:58,455 --> 00:07:59,555
and as for Kudo,

145
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:02,055
if Conan tells him the circumstances,

146
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,755
he can join the match, right?

147
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,755
Well, I won't force you to do this

148
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:09,255
if you and Kudo are such good friends

149
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,855
that you don't want to battle against each other, but...

150
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,655
What're you talking about?

151
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,755
It's a great opportunity.

152
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:20,555
Let's decide, which one of us, Kudo or me is a great detective.

153
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,655
It's about time we make things clear!

154
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,181
Okay, then this is the story, right?

155
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:35,681
When Kazuha was buying the curry at the restaurant,

156
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,581
a foreign man suddenly came out of the restroom

157
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:42,981
and said that a man is dead so call the police, right?

158
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,481
Yes. The restroom's been closed off,

159
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,881
and we're told that just to be safe,

160
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,381
no one should leave the restaurant!

161
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:52,681
Did that foreigner say that in English?

162
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:54,281
It was in Japanese!

163
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:57,281
He was the first to find the dead man!

164
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,781
A guy who speaks fluent Japanese,

165
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:02,381
and the first to find the corpse.

166
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,481
That guy is suspicious.

167
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,981
Well, as far as we're concerned,

168
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,581
you guys who keep coming to the scene of the crime

169
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,081
every time something happens is even more suspicious, you see.

170
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,781
Inspector Megure!

171
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:18,281
Well, recently, as soon as we get to the crime site,

172
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,181
the officer takes it for granted that you called us

173
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:23,081
and lets us right through.

174
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,181
And what is the cause of death?

175
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,781
He was poisoned.

176
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,981
A candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide

177
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,681
was found inside the mouth of the victim

178
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:35,181
and the same candy drop

179
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,281
was also found inside the pocket of the corpse.

180
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:40,081
So, it may be suicide, then?

181
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:44,581
Yes, the foreigner who found him said so.

182
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,081
Who is he? The foreigner.

183
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,481
He seems to be at home at the scene of the crime, so...

184
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:55,281
Well, I guess you can say he's sort of connected to the police.

185
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:57,581
So, you're here too.

186
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:01,581
A foreigner of large physique, who speaks fluent Japanese.

187
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,381
Someone who's used to places like these

188
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,481
and is connected to the police...

189
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,081
Oh! That foreigner is probably...

190
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,281
Yes.

191
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,681
I acted on impulse.

192
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,781
Just as I thought, Investigator Camel!

193
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:19,281
Investigator?

194
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:22,081
You mean you know this evil-looking foreigner?

195
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,281
Heiji!

196
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,881
How rude can you get being honest saying that

197
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,281
he's evil looking!

198
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,981
Kazuha, I think you're being just as rude...

199
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:33,381
More than that, what do you mean investigator?

200
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,881
He's an FBI agent!

201
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,081
FBI?

202
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,081
Yeah.

203
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,181
He's on vacation right now

204
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,281
and is in Japan on a trip right now, right?

205
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,881
Yeah.

206
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,881
I just couldn't forget the taste of the curry

207
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,781
that I ate with my friend when I was previously in Japan,

208
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,081
so I came to eat it alone, then I ran into this case.

209
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,981
Is this curry that delicious?

210
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,781
Okay, so if it's okay with you,

211
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,081
I'd like you to give us the details of

212
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,081
when you found the corpse in the toilet.

213
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,581
Normally I'd refuse,

214
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,981
but since we're always indebted to you...

215
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:05,981
Camel!

216
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:08,881
Could you please explain the situation to them one more time?

217
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,381
Okay then, let's go to the restroom where the crime took place.

218
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,781
Oh?

219
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,781
The FBI.

220
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:35,281
Wasn't Mr. Camel with you?

221
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,581
Well, he said that he wanted to go eat the curry

222
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,981
that he ate at a family restaurant before and left.

223
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,981
Oh, is that curry that delicious?

224
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,481
Beats me, because I haven't eaten it.

225
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:54,881
Talk about the devil.

226
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,881
It's mail from Camel.

227
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,181
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,481
Well...

229
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,681
I tell you.

230
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:09,181
He didn't have to go

231
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:12,481
and commit suicide in a place like this of all places.

232
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,381
And?

233
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:16,781
Has this man been identified?

234
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,281
No, he had nothing on him

235
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,681
that would serve as identification.

236
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,981
The cell phone that would've served as evidence

237
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:26,881
was found floating in the water of the toilet.

238
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,381
Where were you, Agent Camel?

239
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,281
I was doing my thing

240
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,581
in that toilet compartment two doors away from here.

241
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,581
Then, what do you base your deduction

242
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,581
that this was a suicide on?

243
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,981
I heard a voice saying.

244
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,081
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

245
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,481
"I can't help you on that."

246
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,381
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

247
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:47,581
"and killed him."

248
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,681
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

249
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,381
As soon as he finished talking,

250
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:54,981
I heard a groan.

251
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:59,281
I rushed out of the toilet and this is what I saw.

252
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,981
So you rushed out of the toilet, closed this place off

253
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,781
and confined the customers in the store, eh?

254
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:06,881
Yes.

255
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,181
According to the contents of his conversation,

256
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,481
he seems to have been talking with someone from here.

257
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,381
Since he could've wanted to admit to his crime

258
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,381
and turn himself into the police,

259
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:21,281
that someone he was talking to could've tried to shut him up.

260
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:25,781
But, recalling that he was eating alone

261
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,581
and taking into consideration that

262
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,081
I couldn't hear the voice of the person

263
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,081
on the other side of the line.

264
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,281
The person on the other end

265
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,581
tried to stop the person from committing suicide,

266
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,681
but he probably didn't listen

267
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,181
and committed suicide

268
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,481
after repenting the murder he had committed

269
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,281
is what I conclude.

270
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:44,681
Was that voice really this man's voice?

271
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,881
No doubt about that.

272
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:47,981
This person's seat

273
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,181
just happened to be right in front of mine.

274
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,981
He order it quite a loud voice.

275
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,381
So, I guess it is suicide.

276
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,881
Yes.

277
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,881
But, a case in which that Mr. Abe

278
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,881
was poisoned to death couldn't be found in Tokyo.

279
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:07,981
So, I'm having the other prefectures

280
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,281
check on this case for me right now.

281
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,681
I think that person called Abe

282
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:15,681
had quite intimate relationship with this person who died.

283
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,581
Because he used the suffix "chan" when calling him.

284
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,081
Then, you mean he said, "Abe-chan"?

285
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:22,281
Yeah.

286
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:24,781
Didn't you notice anything else?

287
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,081
Maybe you might not have been able to tell,

288
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,681
but whether he spoke with a dialect or something.

289
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,181
Come to think of it.

290
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,681
He talked just like this young man over here!

291
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:35,081
Huh? Me?

292
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,481
Are you saying he was speaking in the Kansai dialect then?

293
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,581
I don't know if you call it the Kansai dialect,

294
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:43,081
but he used the sounds "ya" and "de"

295
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:44,781
at the end of his sentences.

296
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:48,181
Then, that Abe-chan poisoned to death incident,

297
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,381
may have taken place in the Kansai District.

298
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,281
-Check it out right away! -Yes, sir!

299
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,881
What?

300
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:02,181
-Is something on my face or what? -Oh, no.

301
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,881
If you're wondering if I'm a boy or a girl,

302
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,181
the correct answer is, a girl!

303
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,681
Although my boobies aren't sticking out yet!

304
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,481
She sure looks familiar.

305
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,081
I wonder what's going on?

306
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,181
Beats me, a homicide?

307
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,781
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,181
Yes.

309
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,581
I wonder if Heiji and the others are still going to be taking a while.

310
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:30,881
Maybe.

311
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:34,181
Looking at the menu is making me drool, that this is bad.

312
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:37,181
Then would you like an ame-chan (candy drop)?

313
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,681
"Ame-chan"?

314
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,481
A candy drop!

315
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:45,181
Hey. Kudo.

316
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,881
How far do you have this case solved?

317
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,881
Not at all yet.

318
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,781
Well, but if an incident of a person called Abe

319
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:57,381
being poisoned to death is found in the Kansai District,

320
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,681
then we might find something.

321
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,281
I see.

322
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,881
If so, I'm a step in the lead!

323
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,381
You mean... don't tell me, you...

324
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,181
Yeah! I figured out that

325
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:15,181
the man didn't commit suicide but was killed.

326
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:19,681
And that the culprit is still inside this family restaurant!

327
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:53,138
It's not suicide?

328
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,638
Just how do you know?

329
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:58,638
That's because, Kudo...

330
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:03,038
I'm more of a great detective than you!

331
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:04,338
You idiot!

332
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,138
Okay, you're better than me,

333
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,138
so tell me your deduction!

334
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,538
Huh?

335
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,138
What was that?

336
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:16,438
Your voice is so soft, I couldn't hear very well.

337
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:19,438
Like I said, tell me why you think so.

338
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,438
It's what you said before that.

339
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:24,738
You're...

340
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,738
You're better than me.

341
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,138
Absolutely!

342
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,938
Unless, I who is way above you explains,

343
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,738
you can't understand, can you, sonny?

344
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:42,238
He really gets me mad.

345
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,338
Okay, then.

346
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,638
Try recalling carefully what happened during the time

347
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:48,338
-the incident occurred. -The situation.

348
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,938
When Agent Camel was doing his thing

349
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:53,038
in the toilet of the family restaurant,

350
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,138
he coincidentally heard the voice of a man

351
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,238
two doors away from where he was hinting on a possible suicide.

352
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:00,038
So he rushed over to check things out,

353
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,938
and found a man with a hydrogen cyanide laced candy drop

354
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:05,738
in his mouth lying dead, right?

355
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:08,938
What did the voice that hinted on possible suicide say?

356
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,238
Let's see.

357
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:12,238
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

358
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,438
"I can't help you on that."

359
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,638
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-san ate"

360
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,938
"and killed him."

361
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:21,238
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

362
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,038
It's not Abe-san, but Abe-chan!

363
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,538
Don't get it wrong!

364
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,338
It doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,838
Just tell me quick!

366
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:33,638
You already heard that the man spoke in a Kansai dialect, right?

367
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:34,838
Yeah.

368
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:37,038
If you say what was said just now in Kansai dialect,

369
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:38,338
it would be...

370
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:40,938
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

371
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,438
"I can't help you on that."

372
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,238
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

373
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:46,638
"and killed him."

374
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:50,938
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

375
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,338
Right, that's it. He spoke in that fashion!

376
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:57,238
What heard was exactly as he said it just now!

377
00:18:57,238 --> 00:19:00,638
See? Just like I said, the only way you can look at it is,

378
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,338
the man who died, confessed that he poisoned someone to death

379
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,138
and committed suicide to take responsibility

380
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:07,038
for what he did, right?

381
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,438
Oh, well, no...

382
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,138
What he said just now probably...

383
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,438
If it was spoken in the Kansai dialect,

384
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:14,938
what he meant by "jibun"(me) was actually "you".

385
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:16,938
Huh? Why?

386
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:20,038
In Japanese the word "jibun" means "me", right?

387
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,838
Why does it mean "you?"

388
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:24,538
For example, the phrase, "Temaedomo no sekinin desu."

389
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,138
The word "temae" in this case means ourselves, but...

390
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:29,338
when you say "temae" is used in fighting,

391
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:31,638
you're addressing the opponent.

392
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,838
So you see, Japanese is a bit complicated!

393
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,638
In other words, if you replace "me" with "you"...

394
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:41,138
"You're the one who poisoned Abe-chan to death!"

395
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,338
"If so, you have no choice but to take responsibility for it!"

396
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:46,238
It would turn out like so...

397
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,338
So, the man that died

398
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:51,638
wasn't confessing that he committed a crime...

399
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,638
But was criticizing the other person whom commited the crime

400
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,938
and most likely was trying to persuade the person

401
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,338
to turn himself into the police.

402
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,438
By the way, the "motte" in the phrase

403
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,738
"Abe-chan ni doku motte" (laced what Abe-chan ate with poison).

404
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,138
Didn't you mistake it and hear it as, "nutte" (smear)?

405
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,738
Yeah.

406
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,638
But, it's strange that someone would smear poison on someone else,

407
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:12,238
so I thought you misheard the word.

408
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:16,238
If so, that Abe-chan is not a person's name

409
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,938
but rather, "ame-chan",

410
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:19,738
in other words, a candy drop!

411
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,838
A candy drop?

412
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,138
This candy drop is good, isn't it?

413
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,338
The guy who was found dead in the toilet

414
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:30,838
also had a candy drop in his mouth.

415
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:35,438
I see, so he misheard "ame-chan" for "Abe-chan".

416
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,838
They do sound alike for sure.

417
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,038
But...

418
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,638
why would anyone put the suffix "chan" on the word candy?

419
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:45,338
Like we've been saying, Japanese is complicated!

420
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,938
"Ame-chan" is only exclusively used in the Kansai District.

421
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:49,938
But if so,

422
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:52,038
doesn't that mean there was a culprit in the restroom

423
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:54,538
who made the man take the poisoned candy into his mouth?

424
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,538
Yeah.

425
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,238
The fact that this FBI agent

426
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,438
didn't hear the culprit's voice means that...

427
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:03,938
Most probably, he was scheduled to see the person

428
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:06,938
he was urging to turn himself in

429
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:08,738
but instead of sitting in the same seat, the culprit

430
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:10,138
called the man out to the toilet using the cell phone,

431
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,738
and later poisoned him to death!

432
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,838
If he succeeds in luring the man out using the cell phone,

433
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,138
all the culprit had left to do was to shove

434
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:17,838
the poisoned candy drop into the victim's mouth.

435
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,638
He wouldn't have to talk at all.

436
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,238
And if he sinks the cell phone into the toilet bowl,

437
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:25,138
the data would disappear too.

438
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:28,038
But, what the culprit didn't expect was that

439
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,838
an FBI agent coincidentally happened to be in that toilet

440
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:35,038
and swiftly confined the customers inside the store.

441
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,038
In other words,

442
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,038
the murderer is still inside this store, right?

443
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,338
Okay!

444
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:46,738
Narrow down the suspects to men in their 30's and 40's

445
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,638
and start interrogating them one by one!

446
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,438
If he is a childhood friend of the victim,

447
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,338
he would be about that age!

448
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,538
Yes, sir!

449
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,738
So...

450
00:21:56,738 --> 00:22:01,238
I'm a step ahead of him so far!

451
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,438
Him?

452
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:05,438
I thought your match was with Kudo?

453
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,138
Like, I'm saying that

454
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:10,238
I'm more ahead than Kudo who is behind this brat!

455
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:12,138
This brat tells me about

456
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:16,038
the deductions Kudo tell him about with a sassy look

457
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:18,538
that I sometimes get the impression

458
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:19,938
that he's Kudo himself!

459
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:23,038
Well...

460
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,738
I'm sorry but I got this case.

461
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:31,238
If the culprit was the childhood friend of the man who fell victim,

462
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,838
the culprit is also probably from the Kansai area!

463
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:34,938
Therefore, even if there are things

464
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,038
that Kudo who is an Edoite cannot understand,

465
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,538
for me, who is from Kansai, it would be duck soup!

466
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:47,938
I tell you.

467
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:51,538
Camel really has a way of getting involved with all sorts of cases.

468
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,538
Yes.

469
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,438
We're investigating secretly without telling

470
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:58,138
the Japanese police of what we're doing and yet...

471
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,738
Huh? From Camel?

472
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:03,838
Yes.

473
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:08,138
But the only thing he sent is a photo from his cell phone.

474
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,738
A boy?

475
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:16,637
Three?

476
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:18,837
You mean the suspects were narrowed down to three?

477
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,337
Yeah.

478
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,737
There were seven male customers who fit, but...

479
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,237
Four of them had someone with them

480
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,837
and when Mr. Camel came out of the restroom

481
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:30,137
and announced that someone is dead,

482
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:32,937
all four of them were either placing their orders,

483
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:34,937
or having the food that their children

484
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:36,737
had dropped cleaned up.

485
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:39,837
They were in some way interacting with the waitresses.

486
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:43,537
The only ones that don't have an alibi

487
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:45,437
seem to be those three that came alone

488
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:49,437
and were eating in the smoking seat area.

489
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:54,337
Then, let me interrogate them!

490
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:56,237
Don't be ridiculous!

491
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,537
Why would I let a high school boy like you...

492
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,337
The culprit could be a person from Kansai, right?

493
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,937
If so, the culprit may give himself away

494
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,337
if I ask him questions in the Kansai dialect.

495
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,637
My name's Rakutoshi Sugai.

496
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:17,437
I live in a condo in Beika Street.

497
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:20,437
And, where's your homeland?

498
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:25,537
I was born and raised in Tokyo.

499
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:28,137
What is this?

500
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,637
What's with this boy anyway, officer?

501
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,137
Well, don't let yourself be bothered by it

502
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:36,537
and answer his questions.

503
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:41,037
You've been sweating a lot for a while now but...

504
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:43,537
don't tell me you're hiding something?

505
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:45,937
Oh no, this is...

506
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,037
This curry that I ate

507
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:48,537
was more hot and spicy than I expected, you see.

508
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,037
Huh?

509
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:53,237
The incident occurred just about an hour ago, you know.

510
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:56,337
You should've finished eating it long before?

511
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:59,037
I just ate it!

512
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,937
Since you wouldn't let us out of here,

513
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:02,437
for quite some time I started getting hungry.

514
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,237
So, I ordered just a while ago.

515
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,237
A person is dead and I can't see

516
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:08,737
how they have the nerve to take the order.

517
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:15,037
I'm Tohru Amakasu.

518
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:17,237
My friends call me Ama.

519
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:20,337
I live in an apartment in Haido Street now.

520
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:23,637
And, was born and raised in Tokyo.

521
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:26,737
Are you satisfied now, young man from Osaka?

522
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:29,637
You seem to be sweating a lot too.

523
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:33,637
-You scared or something? -I'm not scared.

524
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:36,937
Cut out the nonsense.

525
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:39,637
What's with him, getting scared all of a sudden?

526
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:42,837
He may be more timid and shy than I expected?

527
00:25:42,837 --> 00:25:44,637
Of all things!

528
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:46,537
It's just that the ramen that I ate a while ago

529
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:49,037
was so spicy hot!

530
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:50,637
Hey, you.

531
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:52,637
Rather, the way you're talking...

532
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:55,237
Huh? What's wrong?

533
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:57,137
I'm talking in ordinary Tokyo dialect, aren't I?

534
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:59,737
Nothing's wrong.

535
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:02,137
But, it's annoying, idiot.

536
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,737
Hot spicy ramen?

537
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,937
I'm a resident of Beika Street.

538
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:11,437
My name's Sanpei Tojo.

539
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:15,137
This interrogation is voluntary, isn't it?

540
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,437
Why do I have to go as far as to tell you

541
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,137
about my upbringing?

542
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:23,537
Moreover, to be asked such by a random boy...

543
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:26,737
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to tell me anything.

544
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:28,937
But, it'll only make you look more suspicious.

545
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:31,937
Unlike you, I'm an Edoite of three generations.

546
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,537
Huh?

547
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,437
You look to be sweating a lot too?

548
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,337
Don't tell me you're going to say,

549
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,637
you're perspiring because you ate that Mabo Tofu

550
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:43,237
that you hardly even ate.

551
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:46,137
I'm just prone to perspire a lot!

552
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,937
Besides, I'm not so audacious that I can eat

553
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:52,337
knowing that someone just died, you see.

554
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,437
That's why I even quit eating the sweets

555
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:56,637
that I was planning to eat for dessert too.

556
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:59,237
Well, I think it was a good choice that you quit.

557
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,737
Since sweets will make you fat.

558
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:10,637
And, did you find anyone from Kansai among the three?

559
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:11,637
I wonder.

560
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,137
What do you mean, "I wonder"?

561
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:16,837
That's why we let you interrogate them, you know.

562
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,437
Well, I did find out that...

563
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,937
You found out that?

564
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:25,637
All of them ordered hot and spicy food. That's about it!

565
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:28,637
Hey.

566
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:31,837
No good.

567
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:35,337
Talking about food, I'm getting hungry.

568
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,737
Come to think of it, we haven't eaten lunch yet.

569
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:40,937
Then, would you like to eat too, Heiji?

570
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:43,637
The food here in this family restaurant is really delicious!

571
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:47,137
You mean we're racking our brains investigating this case,

572
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:48,737
but you guys are eating happy-go-luckily!

573
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:52,237
No, we were just starved.

574
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,037
Besides, we're not just eating!

575
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:56,937
Right, Dad?

576
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:00,237
Yeah.

577
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:03,437
We're eating the food that the three suspects ordered

578
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,537
and investigating too!

579
00:28:05,537 --> 00:28:09,037
And, did you figure something out?

580
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:11,637
Well, that the food is good, I guess.

581
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:13,837
You're just merely eating.

582
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,737
Are those dishes really what the three ordered?

583
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,337
Yes! Uncle Kogoro was asking the waitress,

584
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:22,037
so there's no mistake about it!

585
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:24,637
This curry that I'm eating,

586
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:27,737
the salt flavored ramen that Uncle Kogoro is eating

587
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,337
and the Mabo Tofu that Ran is eating,

588
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:30,837
are the three dishes they ordered!

589
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:34,837
Are those three dishes really the right ones?

590
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,537
Yeah.

591
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,737
Well, to put it more accurately,

592
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:41,537
the two who ate curry and salted ramen,

593
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:45,537
drank coffee and ate cake before the main dish.

594
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,637
The guy who ordered Mabo Tofu

595
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:51,437
also ordered fruit for dessert, but suddenly cancelled it,

596
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,337
the waitress said.

597
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,337
I see, so that's the story.

598
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,937
If so...

599
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:02,837
I understand why he talked and acted strange.

600
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:05,837
No doubt about it! He's the culprit!

601
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:11,237
It seems he's found what he's after.
