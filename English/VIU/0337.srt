1
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:04,116
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,216
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,816
A strange case at an ordinary train station.

4
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,716
There's only a marginal difference between goodwill and evil.

5
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,216
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:13,216
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:15,317
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:05,931
Ghads.

9
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:08,431
You keep drinking so much juice,

10
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,531
that's why you have to keep going to the restroom.

11
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:13,131
But, it was good, wasn't it, Pops?

12
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,131
It would've been nice if Ran could've come with us, too.

13
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:17,631
It can't be helped, can it?

14
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:20,331
She had club practice and suddenly ended up not being able to come.

15
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,431
By the way, what do you say?

16
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:25,031
That we go have some ramen before going home.

17
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:27,831
What? You're going to eat again?

18
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:30,831
There's something about French food that gives me stiff shoulders.

19
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,731
I don't feel like I've satisfied my appetite.

20
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,932
Come on, let's go drop by at a ramen shop.

21
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:39,831
Next stop is West Sumita Station.

22
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,832
Transfer here for the Saika Express.

23
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:52,332
"The Truth Behind the Death Fall."

24
00:02:57,832 --> 00:03:01,832
The train will come in. Please stand behind the white line.

25
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,431
-So, for ramen! -West Sumita Station.

26
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:13,331
Let's go, Conan! I think I want salt flavored ramen.

27
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:15,131
What flavor do you want?

28
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:18,531
Hey, Pop's really set on going?

29
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,732
You bastard!

30
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:30,031
Talk about trouble, those guys.

31
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:32,132
Cut it out, cut it out! Stop fighting!

32
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,732
I'm telling you, cut it out! Are you guys deaf or what?

33
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:36,531
Inspector Goto, we've been waiting for you.

34
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:37,732
Is anything wrong?

35
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:44,432
Mouri?

36
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,732
You're Mr. Mouri, that renowned detective!

37
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,331
Really?

38
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,731
Yes.

39
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:56,931
I am Goto of West Sumita Police Station.

40
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:59,331
Well, I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,431
But, I didn't think I'd get to see you here.

42
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:03,931
I'm really honored.

43
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:06,531
He coincidentally witnessed

44
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:09,031
what may be the cause of this incident.

45
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,731
You did, Mr. Mouri?

46
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,831
Yes. But well...

47
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,831
I didn't think that something like this was going to happen.

48
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:18,831
Well, it's really a great help that you're here, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,731
We're counting on you.

50
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,131
I hope I can be of help.

51
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:27,032
I guess you can leave things to me since I'm here anyway.

52
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,731
Hey, hey.

53
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,231
Have you identified the victim?

54
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,931
Yes, he is Keisuke Furuta, age 42.

55
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:39,131
He is an office worker who lives nearby.

56
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,231
He seems to always come home on this train,

57
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,431
and it seems that he was on his way back home today, too.

58
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:45,631
The cause of his death is due to a fractured skull

59
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:47,531
from a violent blow to his head.

60
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,631
He got into a fight with this person here,

61
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,431
Mr. Hideki Sugimoto, age 27.

62
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,331
He works at a company in the city of Tokyo.

63
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,531
I am Goto from the West Sumita Police Station.

64
00:05:57,532 --> 00:06:01,631
Will you please explain what just happened?

65
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,631
It's kind of noisy here.

66
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:07,931
You may use the break room for station employees if you like.

67
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,131
Mr. Noriwaki.

68
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:11,331
Yes, sir. This way, please.

69
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:13,332
That would be a great help.

70
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:20,432
What is this wound he has here?

71
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,531
I went to an after-hours business contact meeting tonight,

72
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:28,632
and I was on my way back home.

73
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:34,131
I suddenly had to go to the restroom

74
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,531
and put my knapsack on the net shelf,

75
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,232
then headed for the restroom.

76
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,831
My stomach was feeling queasy

77
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:48,231
so I stayed inside for some time and came out.

78
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,432
My knapsack was gone.

79
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,431
And?

80
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:55,431
Then, I happened to look out at the platform

81
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:58,232
and saw him with my knapsack.

82
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,931
Hold it!

83
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,431
What do you think you're doing? That's my knapsack!

84
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,931
Just what do you think you're doing?

85
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,631
What's with you?

86
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:09,731
He wouldn't give my knapsack back to me.

87
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,231
So you got into a fight?

88
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,531
Yes.

89
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,132
And when I tried to take my knapsack back...

90
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,332
The strap cut off, and...

91
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:32,132
Unluckily the under construction fence wasn't there.

92
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:37,532
Which means you have never meet Mr. Furuta before?

93
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:41,032
No, I haven't.

94
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,931
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

95
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,231
I feel sorry for him.

96
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:52,631
But Mr. Furuta wouldn't have gone through what he did

97
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,632
if he didn't take Mr. Sugimoto's knapsack in the first place.

98
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,231
I wonder

99
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:03,831
if Mr. Furuta was really trying to steal Mr. Sugimoto's bag?

100
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:05,831
What do you mean?

101
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:09,731
Maybe he thought that somebody had forgotten it?

102
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,131
Forgotten?

103
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,331
Yes.

104
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,131
He has delivered forgotten goods to us

105
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,531
several times in the past, too.

106
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:19,431
Among all of us, we thought that he was a nice person,

107
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,031
a rare breed, not too easily found in recent years.

108
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:24,131
He doesn't seem like the type who would steal something

109
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,031
that someone else had forgotten.

110
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,431
Really?

111
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:28,632
Yes.

112
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:32,032
Mr. Mouri.

113
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:36,331
If it's really as you say,

114
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,731
he may have confirmed the owner of the bag

115
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,131
before he got off the train.

116
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:43,731
Go and question the passengers on the double.

117
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,932
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:48,931
Inspector.

119
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:51,431
Please calm down, Mr. Sugimoto.

120
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,331
We have to wait for testimony from witnesses.

121
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,632
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,532
It's just as the station employee had said.

123
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,031
Mr. Furuta seems to have confirmed whether the owner was around

124
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,332
before getting off the train.

125
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,431
Really?

126
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:17,131
Yes. There was a passenger who remembered you, Mr. Sugimoto,

127
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:19,331
when you stood to go to the restroom,

128
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,831
and also saw that Mr. Furuta came on the train after you.

129
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:24,131
In other words, Mr. Sugimoto went to the restroom

130
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,331
leaving his knapsack on the net shelf.

131
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,831
Then Mr. Furuta who boarded the train later,

132
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,831
took the knapsack to be a forgotten item,

133
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,631
took it and got off the train.

134
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,131
Mr. Sugimoto who had gone to the restroom

135
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:38,031
thought that his knapsack was being stolen,

136
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:39,331
found Mr. Furuta among the passengers

137
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:43,332
who had gotten off the train and tried to get it back.

138
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:48,231
Mr. Furuta thought that he confirmed the owner,

139
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,331
so when he was told to "Give the knapsack back",

140
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,031
he couldn't believe it off the bat.

141
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:55,431
Mr. Furuta was also probably a very righteous man.

142
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,131
He probably got into a fight

143
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,131
trying to keep the knapsack from being taken away.

144
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,731
I guess this is a tragedy that was born from a misunderstanding.

145
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,731
Oh, no.

146
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,831
Mr. Sugimoto, you're to blame too, you know?

147
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:12,031
You didn't have to jump on him so aggressively as you did, too.

148
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:14,431
I lost my temper.

149
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,731
He goes out of his way to deliver a forgotten item

150
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,832
and dies, poor guy.

151
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:25,532
You can have this back.

152
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,331
It's gone.

153
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,031
What seems to be the matter?

154
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:40,031
The receipt is gone.

155
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,331
Receipt?

156
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,731
The receipt of the store I went to with my client.

157
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,831
I had it in here with the change.

158
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,132
Both are gone.

159
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:53,131
Maybe you put it in your pocket or something?

160
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,931
No, I'm positive I put it in the wallet.

161
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,331
Give me a break.

162
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:58,731
Maybe it fell on the platform

163
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,031
when you were struggling with each other.

164
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:02,431
Officer Saito.

165
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,132
I'll go check.

166
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,031
How was it?

167
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:15,231
Well, there was nothing of that sort on the platform.

168
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,131
But inspector...

169
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,832
I brought Mr. Furuta's belongings.

170
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:25,031
Japanese Restaurant Sasayama?

171
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:29,432
Inspector, could you show me that?

172
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,131
Go ahead.

173
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,431
Excuse me.

174
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,231
Just as I thought.

175
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:39,231
This is the receipt I was looking for.

176
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,731
See. Mr. Hideki Sugimoto.

177
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:45,332
The price was for the food was 25,000 yen.

178
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:50,632
But, why was it in Mr. Furuta's pocket?

179
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,932
I can't figure it out.

180
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,632
The thing is...

181
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,531
It was just once in the past.

182
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,231
But, there was a time that money was taken

183
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:07,631
from the forgotten item that Mr. Furuta had turned in.

184
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:09,231
What?

185
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:13,131
Back then, Mr. Furuta was suspected, too.

186
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,731
But, he was deemed innocent after we decided

187
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:17,731
that the thief wouldn't go out of his way to turn in a stolen item.

188
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:21,132
I see. So that's the story.

189
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:26,331
Mr. Furuta probably had a habit of stealing money

190
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:29,231
from the forgotten items he turned in.

191
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,431
A habitual thief?

192
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,731
That's why he couldn't return the knapsack.

193
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,831
Because if he did, the fact that he stole the money

194
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,531
would be revealed on the spot.

195
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,832
Is that so?

196
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,731
I can't believe Mr. Furuta would ever do something like that.

197
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,332
It's very difficult to believe.

198
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,031
Mr. Sugimoto!

199
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:50,431
Yes.

200
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:52,931
Just to be safe, will you check to see

201
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,231
if anything else had been stolen?

202
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,332
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,831
Everything else is here.

204
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,231
I see.

205
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:15,631
Please fill in this form then.

206
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:16,832
Yes.

207
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,131
Could you please lend me a ball pen?

208
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:27,231
Excuse me for not noticing it.

209
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,432
Here you are.

210
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,732
Thank you.

211
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,332
You bastard!

212
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:57,032
It's just as I thought.

213
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:11,631
I see.

214
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:16,732
I figured out the real truth hidden behind this accident.

215
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,152
Ghads, what kind of important talk could there be?

216
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:31,352
And where'd Conan go off to after calling me out like this?

217
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:45,068
Pops, you can leave the rest to me.

218
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:49,268
Okay, this will be fine.

219
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,667
Inspector Goto.

220
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:54,967
What is it?

221
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:58,867
Mr. Mouri wants all of us to come to the platform.

222
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:01,368
To the platform?

223
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,268
What on earth is it, Mr. Mouri?

224
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,567
That pose is...

225
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:11,868
The rumored "Sleeping Kogoro"?

226
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,668
But inspector...

227
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:20,067
Mr. Mouri, this case was solved as being an accident

228
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,967
that happened from a man trying to get back his knapsack.

229
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,767
Inspector Goto, that's not the story, though.

230
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:26,768
What?

231
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,467
Just what do you mean?

232
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,767
I'll explain that in a minute.

233
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,167
First of all, will all of you

234
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:37,667
try to recall Mr. Sugimoto's testimony?

235
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,967
It's true that Mr. Sugimoto returned after going to the restroom

236
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:42,967
and realized that his knapsack was gone.

237
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:47,267
He sees Mr. Furuta on the platform and rushes off the train.

238
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:48,867
That's right, isn't it?

239
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,967
Yes, right.

240
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:54,967
But we saw Mr. Sugimoto

241
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:58,268
came dashing out from near the vending machine, instead.

242
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,367
And is there anything strange about it?

243
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,867
Don't you think it's funny?

244
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:07,067
If Mr. Sugimoto jumped off the train from the front,

245
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,668
why would he be in a place like that?

246
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:15,168
He would've run there from a different direction.

247
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,267
I see.

248
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,467
Come to think of it, yes.

249
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:23,068
It's unnatural that he was by the vending machine over there.

250
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:27,267
But, why did Mr. Sugimoto do that?

251
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:29,367
He was waiting

252
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:32,167
for Mr. Furuta to take the money out.

253
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,168
What?

254
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,567
Why?

255
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,867
You're only running wild on imagination.

256
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,967
Mr. Sugimoto probably knew

257
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,767
that Mr. Furuta would take money out of the wallet

258
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:45,067
pretending to turn the knapsack in.

259
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:46,767
That's why he left the receipt

260
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,467
inside his wallet deliberately with the money.

261
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,567
Because if the receipt is found,

262
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:55,367
and the fact that Mr. Furuta stole the money is revealed,

263
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,067
Mr. Sugimoto aggressively trying to get his knapsack back

264
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,167
would be justified.

265
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,667
That's not true!

266
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,367
Then?

267
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:07,967
Yes, Mr. Sugimoto deliberately put the net shelf

268
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:11,067
and went to the restroom

269
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:12,968
to make Mr. Furuta steal the money.

270
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:17,267
There were other passengers on the train.

271
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:20,867
Why did Mr. Furuta think that the knapsack was a forgotten item?

272
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:23,268
The cell phone.

273
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:25,967
The cell phone?

274
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,867
Didn't you realize

275
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:31,067
that there was a cell phone inside the knapsack?

276
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:35,668
Probably a cell phone with a history of incoming calls.

277
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,367
Mr. Sugimoto, who went to the restroom

278
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:41,567
just before arriving at West Sumita Station,

279
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,667
with his other cell phone

280
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,668
and called the cell phone in the knapsack.

281
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,767
The phone rang, but no one answered it.

282
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:01,667
That's why he thought that the knapsack was a forgotten item.

283
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,267
I see.

284
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,667
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

285
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,467
Mr. Sugimoto quietly watched

286
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,267
while Mr. Furuta hid behind materials of the construction site

287
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:14,067
and took out the money.

288
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,467
He grabbed Mr. Furuta and dragged him

289
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,867
and pushed him into the keep-out area.

290
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:21,868
Then, he pushed him over with all his might.

291
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:28,767
Of course,

292
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:31,967
the rope that held the fence of the keep-out area in place

293
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:35,368
was cut beforehand.

294
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,467
Then all he had to do next

295
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,467
was pull the knapsack from Mr. Furuta

296
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,967
who was down on the ground.

297
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,867
If Mr. Furuta fought back to keep the knapsack from being taken away,

298
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:49,467
the strap which had been cut in advance would be slit

299
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:51,867
and Mr. Furuta who loses balance would fall off

300
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:55,167
the overpass platform to the ground below.

301
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,567
The shoulder strap was cut beforehand?

302
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,568
I'm sorry but I would have to check it.

303
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,467
Inspector!

304
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,567
Yes, it was no accident.

305
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:09,568
It was a planned murder under the pretext of an accident.

306
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,867
That's absurd!

307
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,767
That's nothing more than a far fetched story.

308
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:17,967
Listen, he tried with all his might

309
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,167
and resisted giving me back the knapsack.

310
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:23,767
How could I have knocked him down, then pushed him over?

311
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:27,067
Things don't work out that well.

312
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,168
As a matter of fact it does.

313
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,267
If you use the ballpoint pen

314
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,968
that you have stuck to the inner pocket of your suit.

315
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,768
Ballpoint pen?

316
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,967
You cornered him to behind the materials

317
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:46,268
and poked Mr. Furuta with all your might with that ball pen.

318
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,967
While Mr. Furuta flinched from the pain,

319
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,768
you pushed him.

320
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:09,167
The mark left by the ball pen was left

321
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,368
plain and clear on the back of his hand.

322
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,968
How about it, Mr. Sugimoto?

323
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,668
Mr. Sugimoto.

324
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,867
I couldn't forgive him!

325
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,968
He took the life of my girl!

326
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,667
6 months ago.

327
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,467
He rammed full speed into my girlfriend

328
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,968
who was crossing the pedestrian crossing.

329
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:09,468
We were going to get married soon.

330
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,067
There were no witnesses

331
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,867
and Furuta's version insisting

332
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:18,467
that the pedestrian ran into the street went through,

333
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,867
and he wasn't even prosecuted.

334
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:23,067
That's much too cruel.

335
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:25,067
Ruthless.

336
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,967
So, you decided to kill Mr. Furuta

337
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,467
under the pretext of an accident.

338
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,167
I just couldn't...

339
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,668
I just couldn't make myself forgive him.

340
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,568
"Mouri Detective Agency."

341
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:12,868
Okay, it's ready.

342
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:17,467
I tell you, Dad.

343
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:19,567
Just because the ramen shops were closed

344
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:23,067
you don't have to go out of the way to cup ramen, do you?

345
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,768
Don't you agree, Conan?

346
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,367
Who cares? What's the big deal?

347
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:30,768
This is just the thing for me after all.

348
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:43,468
It's so good.

349
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,667
Maybe I'll have another serving.

350
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:47,968
You're going to get fat.

351
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:51,667
Well, this indeed matches Pops

352
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:54,368
more than French cuisine for sure.

353
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:59,967
"Next Episode."

354
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:01,868
Strangled.

355
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,667
I feel bad for Ai,

356
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:08,867
but I guess she'll just have to stick it out till then.

357
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:10,667
I'd at least like to know

358
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:14,467
if it's me that's being marked or her.

359
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,368
Otherwise, I can't move.

360
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:21,568
Don't worry. I'll solve it right away.

361
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,467
Next Conan,

362
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:27,568
"Four Porsches (Part 1)"

363
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:46,167
Next Conan's Hint:

364
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,567
"Reel."

365
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:48,568
The next episode is a new development.

366
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,168
A red Porsche, a white one, a green one and a black one.
