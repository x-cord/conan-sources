1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:07,161
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,961
"Detective Conan" celebrates

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,561
its seventeenth year of serialization.

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:15,961
So far we have managed to solve numerous tough cases.

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:18,361
This year we shall present even more...

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,061
Suspenseful...

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,361
Actively...

8
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,261
Powerfully...

9
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,161
And mysteriously...

10
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,161
Upgraded contents with your support.

11
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,161
So please continue your support!

12
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,561
All right, viewers.

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,161
I shall enumerate the 108 bagfuls of attributes you will need

14
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,761
to sail through the entire year.

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,961
The first bag being "patience".

16
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,761
The second, a "sleeping bag"...

17
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:55,361
Pops, keep sleeping until the end of the year.

18
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:16,061
If all cases were men,

19
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,061
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

20
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,561
The cry of a boy who cries wolf.

21
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:21,461
The code-like secret of karuta cards.

22
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,061
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,761
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:27,061
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:56,243
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 1)"

26
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,543
"Mouri Detective Agency"

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,470
Conan, don't.

28
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,570
Don't move.

29
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,570
Wait.

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,070
It's all right.

31
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,770
Just stay still.

32
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,670
It sure feels like a fever.

33
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,570
Did you catch a cold? Your face is all red too.

34
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,170
No, my face is red for a different reason.

35
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,270
Wait here.

36
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,170
I'm going to take your temperature with a thermometer.

37
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,570
I'm fine.

38
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,370
It'll completely go away, even if I leave it alone.

39
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,670
See, you're coughing.

40
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,570
It really is a cold.

41
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,970
You hear me?

42
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,170
Stay put until I'm back, okay?

43
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,570
Yes.

44
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,570
Are you going somewhere?

45
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,970
That's right.

46
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,770
To buy a thermometer since you stepped on it last night

47
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,670
and broke it.

48
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,570
Geez, to think I'd catch a cold so early in the year...

49
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,870
My precious winter vacation is ruined.

50
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,870
My phone?

51
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,070
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya" -It's from Mitsuhiko.

52
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,970
A video call at a time like this?

53
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,070
What's wrong, Conan?

54
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,870
We made plans to meet at Ayumi's place

55
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,170
to play karuta cards, didn't we?

56
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,270
We already ate the mochi.

57
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,770
Are you still sleeping?

58
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,670
A cold, I have a cold.

59
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,970
Well, I'm only coughing a little,

60
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,070
so it's no big deal.

61
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,670
Then, let me see the back of your throat.

62
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,970
I'm going to examine you.

63
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,270
Like this?

64
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,570
No way, what's going on there?

65
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,270
The lateral pharyngeal bonds medical to your palatine tonsils

66
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,670
are inflamed and swollen?

67
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,170
Isn't it an acute upper respiratory tract infection?

68
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,270
What?

69
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,470
Idiot.

70
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,070
"Acute upper respiratory tract infection"

71
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,470
simply means a cold.

72
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,670
And to begin with,

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,170
you can't possibly see the back of my throat via a video call.

74
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,370
Bingo.

75
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,270
Well, if it's a cold,

76
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,770
you'd better warm yourself and rest quietly for today.

77
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,670
In that case, why not go check on him?

78
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,170
-You're right. -Let's go visit.

79
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,570
Hey, you guys can't come.

80
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,670
I might pass it to you.

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,670
Damn, I really do have a fever.

82
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,270
Looks like someone's here.

83
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Hey, anybody home?

84
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,170
What's wrong?

85
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,770
Bad guys.

86
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,770
Guys I don't know suddenly came to my home.

87
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,670
Hey, Masao.

88
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,370
If you don't behave, I'm going to get angry.

89
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,970
Excuse us.

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,970
My child loves to play pranks just like my husband.

91
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,470
Well, his tendency to over exaggerate

92
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,370
comes from his mother.

93
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,870
Wrong.

94
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,170
These guys really are people I don't know.

95
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,570
It's not a lie.

96
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,770
We're truly sorry for the intrusion.

97
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,070
Help me!

98
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,570
Cut it out with that "help me".

99
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,170
Saying nonsense like that in front of your parents.

100
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,670
-Let me go! Let me go! -You really are mommy's child,

101
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,470
-Let me go! -born from my aching belly.

102
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,770
And your slanted eyes came from daddy.

103
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,670
Who was that kid?

104
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,570
Ayumi, do you know him?

105
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,870
I don't, but if their place is on this floor,

106
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,270
then I think he's the child of Urafune,

107
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,870
who just moved into Room 2806 recently.

108
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,470
Well then, have you already met his dad and mom?

109
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,270
No, because our rooms are far apart.

110
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,670
You only socialize with your close neighbors if you live in a condo.

111
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,070
At any rate,

112
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,770
he sure looks like an infamous little prankster has moved in.

113
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,070
No.

114
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,670
Call the police.

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,770
I think it's highly possible

116
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,770
that he's in some kind of trouble.

117
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,670
-What? -Police?

118
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,370
How do you know such a thing?

119
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,170
They weren't even blood-related,

120
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,570
yet they acted like they were his biological parents.

121
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,670
Well then,

122
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,870
call Officer Takagi and have him come.

123
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,470
Hold it.

124
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,170
This is bad.

125
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,970
It sure seems to be a real cold.

126
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,570
Should we call the police?

127
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,570
Let's call, let's call. Conan said so too.

128
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,770
But, how did Conan know those guys weren't his parents?

129
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,970
Could it be that Conan is an acquaintance of that child?

130
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,170
In that case,

131
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,370
he wouldn't refer to him as "the boy just now", would he?

132
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,870
The source of his deduction was the voices

133
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,470
of those three and their conversations.

134
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,570
And the footage of those three captured

135
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,670
behind my back by this phone.

136
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,170
Can he really be certain that they're not parent and child just that?

137
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,370
He can't, can he?

138
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,970
Perhaps he's talking nonsense

139
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,470
since his cold clouded his judgment.

140
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,470
But Conan is a great detective.

141
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,270
At any rate,

142
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,670
let's go ask the neighbor

143
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,770
about the Urafune family who live in Room 2806.

144
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,470
Our call to Officer Takagi can wait until after that.

145
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,770
You're right.

146
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,870
Let's do that.

147
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,470
What? Urafune, of Room 2806?

148
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,070
So they're my neighbors who just moved in two days ago.

149
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,970
But they haven't dropped by to say hi,

150
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,670
so I don't know them well.

151
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,170
I do remember Uemura who lived in Room 2806 before, though.

152
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,270
The prior resident?

153
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,870
Yes, it seems he was an employee of Isobe Corporation

154
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,370
that was in the news recently.

155
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,070
But he said he's moving out because he quit his job

156
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,470
and is going to another company.

157
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,470
Isobe Corporation?

158
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,770
The treacherous company that's under suspicion of tax evasion.

159
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,870
By "suspicion",

160
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,970
it means they're probably doing something bad, right?

161
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,670
So were those people just now really bad guys?

162
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,270
But she was talking about the person who lived there before.

163
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,770
It had nothing to do with that Masao just now.

164
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,370
Masao?

165
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,870
You mean the boy about your age with slanted eyes and glasses?

166
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,870
Yes.

167
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,770
If it's that kid, I know him.

168
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,670
So you mean only Masao came by to say hi?

169
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,270
What a courteous child.

170
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,770
Courteous? Far from it.

171
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,370
Yesterday, when I returned from shopping

172
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,870
and was about to ride the elevator,

173
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,470
that child came out and said...

174
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,070
Miss, you have so many things.

175
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,070
What floor? I'll press it for you.

176
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,270
Twenty-eighth, please.

177
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,570
You're really helpful.

178
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,970
If it's the 28th floor, it's the same as my place.

179
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,470
Oh, is that so?

180
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,870
Could it be you're with the family who moved in yesterday?

181
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,670
Yes. I'm Masao Urafune.

182
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,970
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,870
Isn't he a great kid?

184
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,370
Right. If only the elevator didn't stop at every floor.

185
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,470
What?

186
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,870
I see. He pressed all the floor buttons and fled.

187
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,570
Indeed. What's more,

188
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,670
he purposely left out the 28th floor.

189
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,170
Really now?

190
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,370
We just saw Masao taken away

191
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,270
by people he claimed weren't his parents.

192
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,470
If that kid said they weren't his parents?

193
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,570
They must truly be his parents, no?

194
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,670
What?

195
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,770
You want to know about the Urafune's who moved in next door?

196
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,270
Beats me...

197
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,270
I'm not the type of person who socializes with neighbors.

198
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,770
Then, did you see anyone weird around the condo?

199
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,870
I can't say he's weird,

200
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,770
but I saw this Hida guy, a producer at Nichiuri TV.

201
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,270
That guy's on TV sometimes.

202
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,970
Come to think of it,

203
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,570
I did see that producer entering Room 2806.

204
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,070
Was this some kind of a case?

205
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,370
No way.

206
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,370
When did it happen?

207
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,870
It was about two weeks ago.

208
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,670
It has nothing to do with Masao,

209
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,970
if it's two weeks ago.

210
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,770
I was pretty intrigued by it,

211
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,670
so I asked the boy with slanted eyes

212
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,770
who came out of Room 2806 yesterday around noon.

213
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,570
I asked him,

214
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,670
"The producer from Nichiuri TV went to your home the other day,

215
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,170
so what happened?"

216
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,270
Wasn't he Masao?

217
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,170
Was the kid wearing glasses?

218
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,370
Yes.

219
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,570
And, what did the kid say?

220
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,270
He said...

221
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,770
It's about a program airing Saturday nights on Nichiuri TV called

222
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,070
"Sudden Visit Dinner Time Next Door".

223
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,170
I heard that they're making a sudden visit to your place tonight.

224
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,270
Really now?

225
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,570
That's what he said, so...

226
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,870
My wife and I cleaned our place in a big hurry

227
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,070
and even prepared a feast,

228
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,370
but no one came no matter how long we waited.

229
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,070
We didn't realize the kid was lying

230
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,670
until after 8 pm when the live show ended.

231
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,970
I was so embarrassed since I even called my friends

232
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,170
to watch me on the show.

233
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,170
So you guys are that kid's friends?

234
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,570
-No. -Just leave already.

235
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,070
I won't be fooled again!

236
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,570
-What a wolf crier he was. -Yes.

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,470
Then, what he said earlier must be a lie too.

238
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,970
Is that so? Understood.

239
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,970
Ai, who were you calling?

240
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,970
Nichiuri TV.

241
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,570
I thought they may have something to do with this.

242
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,170
But I couldn't get a hold of that producer.

243
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,270
Well, producers at the TV stations are all pretty busy.

244
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,570
No. They said he had a traffic accident two weeks ago,

245
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,170
and was unconscious until yesterday.

246
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,570
Traffic accident?

247
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,670
Could it be that there's some sort of secret in Room 2806,

248
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,770
and somebody assaulted him because he knew about it?

249
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,570
Under the guise of a traffic accident.

250
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,870
Then, maybe Masao also found out about the secret...

251
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,670
But that kid kept crying wolf, didn't he?

252
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,270
However, despise the wolf crier telling the truth in the end,

253
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,970
he was eaten by the wolf because no one believed him, right?

254
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,170
That's true,

255
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,170
but we don't know whether he's telling the truth or not.

256
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,070
But Conan told us to call the police.

257
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,470
In that case, we have no other options,

258
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,170
but to confirm it directly.

259
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,070
Directly?

260
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,070
Indeed. By letting ourselves in the Room 2806.

261
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,070
"Urafune"

262
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,270
Oh, shoot. It's the children from before.

263
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,970
Why?

264
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,970
Because this kid said those things.

265
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,870
It can't be helped, let them in.

266
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,570
In exchange, if you try anything funny...

267
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,570
You understand, right?

268
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,470
What will happen to your mother?

269
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:51,918
"Mouri Detective Agency"

270
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:56,775
37.8～C?

271
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,375
Your fever isn't going away.

272
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,275
Idiot, how could a fever go away in a mere hour?

273
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,975
You already gave the brat medicine, so just leave him alone.

274
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,175
And fix me some lunch.

275
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,275
Then, Conan, I'll make you some Japanese porridge.

276
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:15,075
Can I ask you something...

277
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,475
Did Mitsuhiko or the others call?

278
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,875
No, they didn't.

279
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,475
Did you make plans with them?

280
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:25,875
I... I made plans to play karuta cards with them.

281
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,975
Well, you'll have to pass that up today.

282
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,375
I'll bring you some delicious porridge right now.

283
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,575
Well, I guess they didn't call back

284
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:41,675
because they don't want to disturb knowing I have a cold.

285
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:44,575
And this case can be easily resolved once they call the police.

286
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:47,175
It can't be that they're trying something risky

287
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:49,075
like entering the place where the weird folks

288
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,375
claiming to be his real parents are.

289
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,675
Haibara would never allow it, would she?

290
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,475
Maybe no one's home?

291
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:04,275
Like Conan said, it'd be best if we called Officer Takagi.

292
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:07,675
But if he's wrong, we're the ones that'll get scolded.

293
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:14,475
Well, if it isn't the children from earlier.

294
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:15,875
What's wrong?

295
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,375
Is Masao here?

296
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,675
Could it be that my child...

297
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,675
These guys really are people I don't know.

298
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,775
Said things like that earlier and made you feel uneasy?

299
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,075
Hey, you need to apologize.

300
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,475
These children took you seriously, see?

301
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:39,975
I am sorry for telling a lie.

302
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,975
Well, it seems my child is sorry about lying.

303
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,875
Please forgive him.

304
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,975
Well, good-bye until next time.

305
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:54,975
Hold on.

306
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,075
We actually want to play with Masao,

307
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:00,575
do you mind?

308
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,175
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:05,175
My child and I will be going out this evening.

310
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,075
Then, how about karuta-grabbing?

311
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:09,075
I happened to bring along karuta cards.

312
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,775
If it's karuta, we can play at home.

313
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,475
Let's play together

314
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,375
until it's time for you to head out.

315
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,075
But, my child is not good at karuta.

316
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,075
I'm... I'm very good at grabbing karuta cards.

317
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,875
I haven't lost to anyone yet!

318
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,775
Masao.

319
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,275
Then, if you'll excuse us...

320
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,375
Excuse us!

321
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,275
Wait... what are you guys?

322
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,175
Although it's the same condo as my place...

323
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:40,275
It looks like a completely different room

324
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,675
when you have different furniture.

325
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,175
So true.

326
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,375
All right.

327
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,975
Let's play karuta over there.

328
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:52,675
Then, please go home after you've played one round.

329
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,675
All right!

330
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,575
Then let's get ready.

331
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:57,675
Who has the cards?

332
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,175
Ayumi, right?

333
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,275
Here.

334
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,675
Thanks.

335
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,675
Well, who's reading the proverbs?

336
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,975
There isn't a single trace of the room being ruffled though.

337
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:14,775
So it looks like they didn't come to his home to search for something.

338
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:19,775
However, why did Kudo tell us to call the police?

339
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:23,175
What could he possibly discern from that video call?

340
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,175
This door is locked.

341
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,775
Isn't this the restroom?

342
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:34,475
My husband is inside.

343
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,075
His stomach has been acting up,

344
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,075
so he's been inside, for a while.

345
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,275
There's another restroom in the back.

346
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,675
Use that one instead.

347
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,075
Yes.

348
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:46,775
Pops. Sorry, I didn't mean to rush you.

349
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,675
Yes, don't worry about it.

350
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,675
If I were to shoo those brats off,

351
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:58,675
they'd probably go and call the police.

352
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,375
So I'll just be patient

353
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,175
and let them play one round of karuta.

354
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,775
However, if you try to make so much as a peep,

355
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:09,675
instead of grabbing karuta cards, I'll be grabbing your life.

356
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,375
Well, let's move on.

357
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,075
The dog that trots about finds a bone.

358
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:29,575
Got it.

359
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,575
Ayumi did it again.

360
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,275
That's awesome.

361
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,375
You've grabbed six cards already.

362
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:40,775
Last night I had my parents help me practice.

363
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:44,875
On the other hand, you still have zero cards.

364
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,875
I just haven't gotten going yet.

365
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,575
Now, let's keep the ball rolling.

366
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:52,375
All right, I'm gonna grab the next one.

367
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,975
Haste makes waste.

368
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:58,775
Yes, this one.

369
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:04,775
Evidence speaks louder than words.

370
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,175
Add insult to injury.

371
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:15,375
Got it.

372
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,975
On to the next one.

373
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:21,175
A hated child thrives better in the world.

374
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,275
I was the first to take this.

375
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,475
Liar, I was faster than you.

376
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,775
No way. I was faster.

377
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,475
Well, why don't you guys sort it out by rock-paper-scissors?

378
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:44,175
No way. I'll never let you have it.

379
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:46,575
Because this card "ni" is my card.

380
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,275
You mean, "A hated child thrives better in the world"

381
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,875
is your card?

382
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,275
Since this is Masao's first card,

383
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,975
why don't you let him have it?

384
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,275
Fine.

385
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,175
A card he'd never let go...

386
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,375
Is he trying to form a message

387
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,675
with the characters on the karuta cards?

388
00:23:58,575 --> 00:23:59,975
Mommy, restroom.

389
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:02,475
You can't go to the restroom on your own?

390
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,875
Take out that towel.

391
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:07,275
The towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa.

392
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:10,275
I see. So that's what he meant.

393
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:13,275
Hey, if we don't decide on a strategy soon,

394
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:15,075
they'll be back before we know it.

395
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,075
Whose cell phone is that?

396
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,875
Don't tell me...

397
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,175
Next Conan,

398
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:27,275
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 2)"

399
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:45,175
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:47,175
"Horsehair Crab".

401
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:48,675
Conan, since crabs are hard to eat.

402
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:49,975
Here, open your mouth.

403
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,975
No, no, I'll eat it myself.
