1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,684
Wimbledon in the rain.

2
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:07,584
The roof has closed over the Center Court.

3
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:09,684
The game will resume.

4
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:13,084
The score is 6-6 and it is a tie-break.

5
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:16,684
Serve begins with Baur that has won the 1st set.

6
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:24,884
The queen appears again.

7
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,484
Struggle with all your might

8
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:31,484
in order to keep your mother alive as long as possible.

9
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:39,484
If I lose this tie-break,

10
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:42,284
mother will...

11
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:45,384
Come on, Minerva!

12
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:49,384
Don't give up the fight!

13
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:52,884
Even though she has a championship point!

14
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,584
Hang in there, win the match!

15
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,584
Hang in?

16
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,784
Grass Court Queen.

17
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,484
Can you do it?

18
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:05,984
Okay!

19
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,884
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,084
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:13,284
An exchange rally, of life at stake.

22
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:15,584
The unexpected two and the two whose excitement heightens.

23
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,184
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,984
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:21,284
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:04,769
An eerie coded note was what was waiting for us in London.

27
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,269
It was the forewarning of a killing by Hades Sabara,

28
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,369
a vicious criminal on the run.

29
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:13,669
We deciphered the code and figured out

30
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,869
that Hades was after the life of contestant Minerva Grass,

31
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:19,069
who was competing in the Ladies' Singles Finals

32
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,369
at the Wimbledon Center.

33
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,969
But thanks to the Braille messages

34
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:27,069
that Minerva sent by landing the balls

35
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,869
that she served at certain points on the court,

36
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,869
we further found out that Hades was not after Minerva,

37
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,969
but rather after her mother Juno

38
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:36,269
who was in the stands cheering for her.

39
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,469
Hades will push the switch to set off the bomb

40
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,369
as soon as the game ends.

41
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,869
We've got to find him before he does so!

42
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:56,269
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (0 is Start)"

43
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,069
Play!

44
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,169
Just as would be expected of an apprentice of Holmes.

45
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,369
You've thought it out, haven't you?

46
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,669
But it sure is a high risk demand.

47
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,869
After all my opponent's a powerful server

48
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:16,169
who ranks number 2 in the world

49
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,169
that possesses serves that exceed 120 MPH...

50
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,969
Demeter Baur!

51
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,269
Yes!

52
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,269
1-0, Ms. Bauer!

53
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:38,469
But, if that's going to help nab the culprit...

54
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,269
If I can save mother...

55
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,169
I'll show you

56
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,469
what this Grass Court Queen Minerva Grass...

57
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,169
can really do!

58
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,369
1 all!

59
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:57,169
Amazing! She returned a service Ace.

60
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,569
But how do you settle a tie-break, anyway?

61
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,169
The one scores 7 points first will win this set.

62
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,069
But, if the score is 6-6,

63
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,769
the game continues until there is a difference of 2 points.

64
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,769
So, if the Grass Court Queen is lead by two points...

65
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,369
My sister who lost the 1st set will lose,

66
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,369
and the game ends.

67
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:24,069
If that happens, the guy called Hades

68
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,069
will set off the bomb that mother is carrying, right?

69
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,469
Out!

70
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,669
7-6, Ms. Bauer!

71
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,969
Hey, she's being lead by a score of 7-6, which means...

72
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,769
The opponent has the championship point!

73
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,469
If the opponent scores next, Minerva will lose.

74
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,769
Sis...

75
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,769
So, you're at the end of your rope, Grass Court Queen.

76
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,769
As soon as the game ends,

77
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,369
I'm pushing the switch and blowing your mother up.

78
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,969
And, as I wrote in the memo that was inserted into your wristband,

79
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,269
I'll give you the image of that moment

80
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:14,769
when your mother blows up to pieces.

81
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:21,369
You, who lost miserably at last year's All French Open

82
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,769
leaving my mother to die...

83
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,669
Then, a month after that, on the funeral day of mother,

84
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,469
you won an overwhelming victory,

85
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,769
and raised the trophy high and proud in the air.

86
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,869
In order to make you taste

87
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,169
the anger and sadness I felt back then too!

88
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:41,069
So, little apprentice of Holmes.

89
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,369
I've given the championship point

90
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,069
to the opponent just as you wanted me, too.

91
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,369
I found mother with the high lob ball I just shot.

92
00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:01,069
So, now you do your part and find him, all right? The culprit.

93
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:02,969
And live up to your name as the apprentice of Holmes!

94
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,469
First the center, slightly weakly...

95
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,069
She'll shoot back with forehand.

96
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,569
She'll return the ball to my back side.

97
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,769
I'll slice return with a strong backhand slice.

98
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,869
At the caliber you're playing today, you can easily...

99
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,569
return the ball, can't you?

100
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,769
What a fantastic rally.

101
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,869
It's been going on for over 10 minutes already!

102
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,569
Hang in there, Minerva!

103
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,369
Frame shot!

104
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,969
It's big! Out!

105
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,669
I'll volley then, before it outs!

106
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,269
Shoots, it's shallow!

107
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,069
It'll come out at the net!

108
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,569
It's a chance ball for the opponent!

109
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:55,969
Finish!

110
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,969
Back court left side.

111
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,469
Just on line!

112
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,769
It's in!

113
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,769
Okay. Now, we're starting over!

114
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,169
But what a long rally.

115
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,669
I think they've been at it over 30 times already?

116
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,169
Don't tell me that Minerva

117
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,669
is deliberately continuing to rally?

118
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,869
She returned the ball that was about to out with a volley, too.

119
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,569
But, what is she continuing for?

120
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,169
So, Hades, where are you?

121
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,869
Where are you?

122
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,669
Show yourself, Hades!

123
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,669
Cord ball!

124
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:54,969
Reach!

125
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,369
Please!

126
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:06,869
No!

127
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,669
She couldn't reach it.

128
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:11,169
Then, don't tell me that...

129
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,769
Sis lost...

130
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,169
Game set, and match won by...

131
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,969
Challenge!

132
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:25,669
What's that? Challenge?

133
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,669
The challenge system.

134
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:30,469
If discontented with the referee's judgment of where the ball dropped,

135
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,969
you can reconfirm the place

136
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:35,269
where the ball fell, 3 times to a set!

137
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:37,769
This done by using Hawk Eye, that is,

138
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,169
10 devices that replay the recorded data by CG images!

139
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,669
So, I'm sure that Minerva's going

140
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,569
to insist that the ball just now was out!

141
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:51,469
A poor loser queen.

142
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:54,769
Begging for life before the guillotine?

143
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,269
But the judgment's not going to turn over.

144
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,369
And right after the cheers of joy,

145
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,969
the silent interval during the sound of the blast and screams

146
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,769
will be a requiem in tribute to your mother.

147
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,569
It's out!

148
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,569
Her challenge succeeded!

149
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,469
Which means it's a tie of 7-7!

150
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,669
I somehow managed to get by.

151
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,669
But I can't go on rallying anymore.

152
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,269
But...

153
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:42,069
It seems from the look on your face, that you found him.

154
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,283
She did it!

155
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,583
She caught up!

156
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,183
Next, it's the final set.

157
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,283
No matter which side wins, if the game ends,

158
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,083
Hades will set the bomb off.

159
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,783
No need to worry! I just got mail from Holmes' apprentice

160
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:04,583
that he found the culprit.

161
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,883
So, I'm sure he's off to nab the culprit already.

162
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,683
-Huh? -Huh?

163
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:11,283
Please let me in!

164
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,383
Like I've been telling you,

165
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:16,283
this is the wrong place for your ticket.

166
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:19,383
I must see someone before the game's over!

167
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:22,383
I will come back right away! Please!

168
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,883
You might need this.

169
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:27,983
When this boy ran into me,

170
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:31,383
we happened to exchange our tickets.

171
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:34,083
Well, you can enter here, then.

172
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,183
I'm happy for you, sonny.

173
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:42,483
Hey, come on, hurry on and go!

174
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,083
The dialect of Tosa?

175
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,783
After all, you finally found the culprit.

176
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,383
Hurry on

177
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,583
and nab him!

178
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,483
Shin-chan.

179
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,183
Mom?

180
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,883
Okay, I got you!

181
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:02,783
But I wonder how Shin-chan found the culprit?

182
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:05,183
By the movement of the faces of the spectators!

183
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,483
The people who are here to watch the match move,

184
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,483
their heads to the right and left watching the ball.

185
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,983
If the ball goes to the left, they move this way.

186
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:16,083
If it's struck back to the right, then this way.

187
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,483
If you're sitting in a seat

188
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,683
where you're watching the players from the side, it's for sure.

189
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,283
But, if there's a spectator whose not moving at all,

190
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,283
he would stand out, wouldn't he?

191
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:28,383
If it's during the championship point, the more so.

192
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:31,183
In other words, that person would be the culprit

193
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,783
who is planning to blow up the mother of the Grass Court Queen,

194
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:39,183
in addition to recording the moment onto a video camera!

195
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,483
He's got to have his target locked inside the frame of his camera

196
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,783
before the end of the game,

197
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,783
otherwise his view would be blocked

198
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:49,283
by the people who stand up in excitement.

199
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:53,383
I see! That's why Shin-chan was telling her

200
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:56,883
to hang in there, even if her opponent scored the championship point!

201
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:58,583
He wanted to buy time

202
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,183
while they continued the rally to look for the culprit.

203
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,683
The Grass Court Queen sure is amazing, though!

204
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,583
To do as she was told without asking questions.

205
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,883
Rather, it was a method that she used to use a lot,

206
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:13,683
so she probably understood right on the bat.

207
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:18,483
The lob ball that she displays during her matches

208
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:21,783
is what she does to find her mother.

209
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:23,883
Because if she knows that the ball is going to out,

210
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,683
she can take her eyes off the ball.

211
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:27,983
From among the spectators

212
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,283
that move their heads up and down following the ball,

213
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:33,883
she searches for her visually disabled mother that doesn't do so.

214
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,483
The question is whether Shin-chan

215
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,283
will be able to nab the culprit that he found.

216
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,583
No problem.

217
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,683
He's probably going to sneak up behind the culprit

218
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,283
and shoot him with the wristwatch

219
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,783
tranquilizer gun that he usually uses.

220
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,583
Okay, I got you!

221
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,883
You're Holmes' apprentice!

222
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,183
You made Minerva rise!

223
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,583
What?

224
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,883
But, you know, that was against manners.

225
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,283
Never do it!

226
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,983
Don't tell me he figured out where I am?

227
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:11,283
That's Holmes' apprentice!

228
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,383
Then, the guy who looks flustered is...

229
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,783
I've got no choice then.

230
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:19,283
I'll set the bomb off

231
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:23,283
and flee out of here amidst the commotion.

232
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,283
Ridiculous! From that distance?

233
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:36,583
Just as expected of the Grass Court Queen.

234
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,983
Nice centering to in front of the goal!

235
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,283
Security guards?

236
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,883
The ball just happened to come...

237
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:04,283
Thank you.

238
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,183
I see.

239
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:16,883
You called the police, and had them waiting.

240
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:21,483
Yeah. I asked a friend at Scotland Yard to help me

241
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,083
since I deciphered the code

242
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,983
and found out where the culprit's target was.

243
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,883
We really had a hard time backing you up

244
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:32,283
in all kinds of ways to make solving the code easier for you.

245
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:34,883
Which means that the lady in sunglasses

246
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:38,483
that was coming around Ran and the others was you, Mom?

247
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,083
I thought it was the bomb lady, Hades friend.

248
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,083
As for her, they seemed to have found out

249
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,983
that she really died when she blew herself up the other day!

250
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:49,483
They confirmed the DNA at the site!

251
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,983
So, that bomb inserted stuffed animal

252
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,083
is what she left behind!

253
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,983
If you knew as much as you did,

254
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:58,383
why didn't go out and nab him yourself?

255
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:01,583
The fact is, I'm the one that solved

256
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,683
the 2nd bombing of the hospital.

257
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:05,583
I couldn't get near the culprit

258
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,683
because he was on the alert for me.

259
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,683
Well, don't get so angry.

260
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:12,983
Your way of looking for the culprit was just perfect.

261
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,483
Besides, we got tickets

262
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,383
that would enable you to go in all directions

263
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,883
no matter where the culprit was.

264
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:23,183
But, if you were following the case,

265
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,483
you could've at least contacted me.

266
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,783
No. We only came to London because she asked us to.

267
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:31,983
She?

268
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:36,283
Game set and match won by...

269
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:37,983
Miss Grass!

270
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:41,683
All right!

271
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,183
Well? This feeling...

272
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,183
Is it about time you recalled something?

273
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:50,183
Minerva asked you to quit being a coach,

274
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,483
not only because she wanted you to quit tennis

275
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:56,183
and become her husband.

276
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,683
She wanted you to remember how it felt to feel like this again.

277
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,583
Although you quit being a tennis player for her,

278
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,883
you should be true to your feelings, Ales.

279
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:08,583
You feel a rush inside you too, don't you?

280
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,883
She won! Minerva won!

281
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:16,783
And since there was no explosion...

282
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,983
They caught the culprit!

283
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:23,583
Yep! I just got a text mail from Holmes' apprentice!

284
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,483
Apollo!

285
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,583
Are you going to be seeing your sister afterwards?

286
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,083
I've got something that I've got to tell her.

287
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,383
But she may be busy with press conferences and the like...

288
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:36,583
Why don't you mail her?

289
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,383
I'll give you her mail address!

290
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,483
Yep! Thank you!

291
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:43,983
Hey. Hold it, there!

292
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,283
Isn't that the lady called Diana?

293
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,783
No way! That's the royal box?

294
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:52,283
Don't tell me she's a member of the royal family?

295
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,483
Or she could be a noble or a friend of a noble.

296
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:56,983
Then, don't tell me that

297
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,983
the man I threw over my shoulder at the restaurant

298
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:02,083
could've been a prince or something.

299
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,783
Should I call and ask her?

300
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:09,383
No, don't. Because I don't want to know.

301
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,483
What was the key to your victory?

302
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,283
What lead to my victory?

303
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:20,283
Well, I suppose I owe it to Holmes' apprentice?

304
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:25,383
But I'm smiling the way I am

305
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,183
thanks to the girl from Japan

306
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:29,383
who sent me a text mail a while ago.

307
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:37,383
"Heathrow Airport"

308
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,583
It was really a surprise

309
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,583
that you came all the way to see us off.

310
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,383
Is it really alright?

311
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:46,383
I'm sure that you're really busy today, and yet...

312
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,983
Yes. I did have a lot of things to do,

313
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,983
but I dropped them all.

314
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:55,583
I wanted to thank you for that mail you sent me, no matter what.

315
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,083
What's this about a mail?

316
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,883
Your words really echoed through my heart.

317
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:06,483
It may be true that in tennis love is 0,

318
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:07,983
but 0 is...

319
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,583
Don't say it! Not here!

320
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,383
Because those words

321
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,883
are what originally came from him.

322
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,383
Him?

323
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,783
You mean the "him" that caused you mental anguish

324
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:24,283
in front of the statue of Holmes?

325
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,583
Yes. Well, sort of...

326
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:30,083
So stupid.

327
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,683
How stupid of me.

328
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:34,383
Getting carried away all by myself.

329
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,883
It's just like she said.

330
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,683
Love is 0.

331
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,083
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

332
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,183
the result is miserable defeat.

333
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,583
Just what're you talking about?

334
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,483
Don't you get it?

335
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,883
You're a detective, aren't you?

336
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:50,983
If you're a detective,

337
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,483
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

338
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,283
Idiot!

339
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,783
Hey, hold it!

340
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:58,883
Ran!

341
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:01,883
I'm telling you, wait!

342
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:06,783
Ran!

343
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:11,983
Hey!

344
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,283
No, let me go!

345
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,883
You're such a nuisance!

346
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,183
What?

347
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,383
You're a nuisance of a case!

348
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,983
And even if I were Holmes,

349
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,683
I would probably not be able to solve

350
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,883
what's going on in your heart!

351
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:30,483
It's impossible to solve what's going on

352
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,383
in the heart of a girl you like!

353
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:50,683
Love is 0? What a laugh!

354
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,883
You go tell that grass queen

355
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:55,083
that 0 is start of everything!

356
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,983
If you don't start from 0, nothing will start

357
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,483
and you can't achieve anything.

358
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,083
Make sure you tell her that!

359
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,983
I see.

360
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:07,083
Your boyfriend's pretty cool.

361
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,683
So, please relay these words to Ales too.

362
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:13,783
I already mailed Ales and got an answer from him.

363
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:15,283
He said that he can't see me for a while

364
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,883
because he has to go to training.

365
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,183
Huh?

366
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:21,583
That's training for a player somewhere, right?

367
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,183
After all, he said he was going to do training for some player.

368
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,983
No, it's for his own training!

369
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:30,783
I think he's planning to make his come-back as a player.

370
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:32,683
In order to marry a Queen,

371
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:35,783
I myself, got become a king.

372
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,983
And because my body's not as sharp as it used to be,

373
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:42,083
as you said, I've got to start from zero.

374
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,583
Rather, start from love?

375
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:12,083
But it's too bad that Holmes' apprentice is not here.

376
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,083
I wanted to thank him, too.

377
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,583
It seems that he had to return to Japan earlier than us

378
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,483
because he had something urgent come up.

379
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,183
Since he got hold of a ticket,

380
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:23,683
he left a step ahead of us together with Doc.

381
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,783
Please give him my regards then!

382
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,283
I will!

383
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,583
You've got to really be grateful to Ai!

384
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,983
Yeah.

385
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,283
But...

386
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:37,283
That girl named Ai Haibara asked me

387
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,283
to bring you over a spare drug

388
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,383
because she was sure that you would drink up

389
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:43,683
the two that you brought along with you for Ran.

390
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,983
She should give me about a hundred of them while she's at it!

391
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,083
You never learn.

392
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:53,883
"Next Episode"

393
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:56,883
Okay, let's hide!

394
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:59,783
Oh boy. I end up being IT after all.

395
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:02,683
There's somebody in this building!

396
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:05,483
252! There's somebody in need of rescue!

397
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:07,283
We're tearing down the building,

398
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:10,283
so we're pounding on the wall and checking how strong it is!

399
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,483
I guess they're people disguised as workers

400
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,483
who'll be tearing down the building, that have someone confined here...

401
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,283
In other words, the two are villains.

402
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:22,883
