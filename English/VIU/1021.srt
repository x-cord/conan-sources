1
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,120
A single blow to the back of the head with a blunt object, huh?

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,230
You again?

3
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,739
I happened to pass by.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,210
Just happened to, huh?

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,959
I suppose I'll tell you what happened.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,649
We haven't found the weapon, but it was some kind of metal pipe.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,090
He was probably killed last night around seven.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,090
His name is Mitsumoto Takeshi.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,350
He had a bad reputation.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,350
So he was a troublemaker.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,609
Does that mean the motive was a grudge?

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,730
Inspector!

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,070
Did you figure something out?

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,279
Yes.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,599
Around seven last night, someone saw a man running away from this park in a hurry.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,200
The witness apparently knew him.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,580
The man who came running from the park is a ruffian named Hosaka.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,580
Hosaka Yorimitsu?

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,869
He often hung out with Mitsumoto Takeshi.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,660
They seemed to get up to trouble together.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,590
What?! Impossible!

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,510
Th-That's Hosaka Yorimitsu.

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,090
Stabbed once in the chest with a knife.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,190
Judging by the body's stiffness, it's been about 17 or 18 hours since he was killed.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,620
There's blood on his index finger.

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,410
Could it be?

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,030
Isn't this a dying message identifying the culprit?

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,920
Shida?

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,350
Shida...

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,229
Shida Yasuho.

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,010
He frequently hung out with Mitsumoto and Hosaka.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,930
Like Hosaka, Shida seemed like a shady guy.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,440
This is the place.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,750
Why...?

35
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,919
Three troublemakers murdered one after another...

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
What's going on here?

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,099
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,979
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,139
With a twirl, a case connecting three shady men emerges!

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,629
Always determining the one truth

41
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,329
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,920
his name is Detective Conan!

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,920
"Rondo in Bad Company!"

44
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,510
Shida Yasuho (35)

45
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,760
Looks like he was poisoned.

46
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,769
People keep dying one after another.

47
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,419
What's going on here?

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,849
Since he was spotted near the crime scene,

49
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,020
it's likely that Mitsumoto Takeshi-san was killed by Hosaka Yorimitsu.

50
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,090
And Hosaka's dying message indicates that it was Shida Yasuho who killed him.

51
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,540
But Shida was killed by someone as well.

52
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,410
What's going on here?

53
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,160
Then Shida-san's murder couldn't be linked to a falling out between them.

54
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,670
The poison was inside that bottle.

55
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,329
Apparently Shida day drank everyday.

56
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,099
The culprit must've added the poison sometime between last night

57
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,680
after he drank that afternoon and when he started drinking today.

58
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,379
Then the other two could've done it.

59
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,680
But if that's the case, then why did they do it?

60
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,910
Inspector!

61
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,229
I found ten stacks of 100 thousand yen.

62
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,570
That's ten million yen.

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,570
There's ten million more yen here, too.

64
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,020
And here.

65
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,830
I haven't counted it yet, but there seems to be 30 million yen total.

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,549
30 million yen? Since that's divisible by three...

67
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,210
What? Could it be?

68
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,260
I've got it!

69
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,389
Shida-san was killed for this money.

70
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:17,770
There must be a witness who saw a suspicious person enter this room and poison the bottle.

71
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,400
Does he really think it'll be that convenient?

72
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,740
We're looking for last night's footage.

73
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,050
That's Shida exiting building A.

74
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,050
He enters the convenience store, and...

75
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,679
Mitsumoto Takeshi?

76
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,000
Is this when he poisoned the bottle?

77
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,760
Looks like Shida-san's murder was connected to their falling out.

78
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,820
But...

79
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:54,010
Why would these three who always hung out together do that?

80
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,349
Huh?

81
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,770
The amount of 30 million yen fits perfectly with the fact that there were three of them.

82
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,570
Is this connected to that incident in Haido City?

83
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,570
That must be it!

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,820
The armed robbery case?

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,569
Three days ago, 30 million yen in cash was stolen

86
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,999
from a financier in the neighboring Haido City.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,369
He was robbed by three masked men.

88
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,330
That must've been Shida and his friends.

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,170
They probably split the money 10 million yen each,

90
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,939
but they all got greedy.

91
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,340
Then, last night...

92
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,100
Hosaka-san killed Mitsumoto-san and took his 10 million yen home with him.

93
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,329
Don't worry, Mitsumoto.

94
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll have fun spending this.

95
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,610
But Shida-san had the same idea.

96
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,689
Don't worry, Hosaka.

97
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll have fun spending all of this.

98
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,990
Shida

99
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,199
He killed Hosaka-san and took the 20 million yen,

100
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,760
but the first victim Mitsumoto-san was plotting the same thing.

101
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,260
I could take your money now,

102
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,740
but as long as you're alive, you'd just take it back.

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,310
Unaware that Mitsumoto-san had poisoned the bottle, Shida-san celebrated with a drink.

104
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,030
That's what happened. Right, Mister?

105
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,530
Probably something like that.

106
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,040
That explains Shida-san's last words, too.

107
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,940
Why...?

108
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,679
He thought he'd get to keep all the stolen money for himself.

109
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,790
He must've wondered why that happened.

110
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,180
So three troublemakers motivated by greed ended up killing each other, and now they're all dead.

111
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,350
And to prove it, each one killed another in a perfect chain.

112
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,680
Hosaka Yorimitsu, Mitsumito Takeshi, and Shida Yasuho.

113
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,190
Their names link together in a circle.

114
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,610
That's an inconsequential discovery, but it's true.

115
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,099
Regardless of the coincidence concerning their names...

116
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,120
That explains all three murders.

117
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,060
The three of them killed each other.

118
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,019
It certainly makes sense,

119
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,669
but one was bludgeoned to death,

120
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,419
one was stabbed to death,

121
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,839
and one was poisoned.

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,140
Why were all three methods different?

123
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,779
What?

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,009
There are three culprits.

125
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,150
It's not that odd for their methods to be different, too.

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,680
Wouldn't it be more natural for there to be some overlap?

127
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,260
I must be overthinking it.

128
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,020
What's that about?

129
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,690
What is it, son?

130
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,910
Well...

131
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,189
Got it.

132
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,760
Thanks for telling me.

133
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,370
What is it?

134
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,669
The boy's name is Nishikawa Mamoru-kun.

135
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,779
He lives on the floor above Shida.

136
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,610
Last night around eight, he saw a suspicious man.

137
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,120
It was a very large man concealing his face with a mask and sunglasses.

138
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,179
He was trying to get into Shida's apartment.

139
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,289
When Mamoru-kun saw him, he said...

140
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,280
Forget you saw me!

141
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,000
That man may be the real culprit.

142
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,769
I see.

143
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,590
That's a curious piece of information.

144
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,350
The question is how he's connected to this case.

145
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,850
Maybe they didn't kill each other.

146
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,579
Maybe that man killed Mitusmoto and Hosaka.

147
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,360
And maybe he poisoned Shida's alcohol when Mamoru-kun saw him.

148
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,370
He put Mitsumoto and Hosaka's 10 million yen in Shida's apartment

149
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,620
so it would look like they killed each other out of greed.

150
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,130
When you think of it that way, it also explains why all three methods were different.

151
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,630
He did it deliberately to make us think there were three culprits.

152
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,209
I see.

153
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,640
It does make sense.

154
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,819
So this was a series of murdered committed by one true culprit

155
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,930
made to look like the three men killed each other.

156
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,329
It's certainly possible.

157
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,190
Where'd that brilliant idea suddenly come from, Chiba?

158
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,690
It must've been a flash of inspiration.

159
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,930
But, Detective Chiba...

160
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,380
If you're right, then the dying message could've been fabricated by that man,

161
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,960
but what about Hosaka-san and Mitsumoto-san's suspicious behavior?

162
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,960
The man must've cleverly manipulated them.

163
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,970
Do you really think there's someone who could manipulate them into doing exactly as he said?

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,470
I'm sure we'll find him.

165
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,110
There's surely a large man familiar with all three of them who held a powerful grudge.

166
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,480
Our true culprit X.

167
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,449
It's worth checking out.

168
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,830
We'll split up and look for him.

169
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,869
Hey, mister.

170
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,610
Since the three victims were troublemakers, it's possible that someone held a grudge against them,

171
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,119
but do you think they'd murder them?

172
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,750
Killing all three of them is pretty crazy, don't you think?

173
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,670
Those three must've done something to X to really make him hate them.

174
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,420
Then why did Shida-san ask "why?" just before he died?

175
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,430
Who knows?

176
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,560
Inspector, I've found someone matching the description.

177
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,719
I was unable to meet with him since he was out, but he's a large man at least 180 cm tall.

178
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,909
He probably resented the three men as well.

179
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,200
Who is he?

180
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,299
Shida's last words were the real dying message

181
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,090
revealing the identity of the true culprit.

182
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,960
What do you mean?

183
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,159
The three of them were middle school classmates.

184
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,930
Their homeroom teacher at the time was Minamide Kokichi.

185
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,810
Apparently the students called him Nande.

186
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,560
Nande?

187
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,700
The three men were already troublemakers in middle school.

188
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,440
Their homeroom teacher Minamide-sensei did his best to reform their behavior,

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,470
but his efforts never paid off, and 20 years later, they were still troublemakers.

190
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,380
When Minamide learned they stole 30 million yen,

191
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,270
he wondered how much more trouble they would cause!

192
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,350
His only choice was to kill them!

193
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,280
As their former homeroom teacher, he felt it was his duty, so he killed them!

194
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,160
He made it look like they killed each other over the money they stole

195
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,200
to teach the world's children that people who commit evil acts

196
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,750
end up destroying themselves!

197
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,660
Though he retired long ago, Minamide Kokichi must've been a teacher to the core.

198
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,139
Their former homeroom teacher could've made up some excuse

199
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,510
to influence Hosaka and Mitsumoto's behavior.

200
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,100
I can't believe there was actually someone who met all the conditions.

201
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,600
It certainly does make sense.

202
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,110
He's out right now?

203
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,070
That's the curious thing.

204
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,609
Apparently the last time his neighbors saw him was yesterday.

205
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,729
Having fulfilled his duty as their former homeroom teacher,

206
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,990
could he have killed himself?

207
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you have business with me?

208
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,710
Are you Minamide Kokichi-san?

209
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,940
Yes.

210
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:47,489
Are you the police?

211
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,720
When I ran into my neighbor over there, they said you were looking for me.

212
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,599
I've been at Spa Land Utamaro since yesterday.

213
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,190
Stone saunas are awesome.

214
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,630
Spa Land Utamaro?

215
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,950
I'll go check it out.

216
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,570
We'd like to ask you a few questions concerning Mitsumoto Takeshi and Shida Yasuho's murders.

217
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,970
Mitsumoto and Shida?

218
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,540
Who are they?

219
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,540
They were your students 20 years ago.

220
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,979
My former students?

221
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,520
I don't remember them at all.

222
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,589
I was able to confirm his alibi for yesterday afternoon to today.

223
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,250
He has an alibi?

224
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,310
No way!

225
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,060
What's wrong with him?

226
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,070
If it's not Minamide, then who is X?

227
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,320
In any case, we have to find him!

228
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,819
Find the large man who resented all three of them!

229
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,780
Yes, sir!

230
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,280
I'll help, too.

231
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,749
But where else are we going to find someone who meets all the conditions,

232
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,060
like a former homeroom teacher?

233
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,670
Wait a minute.

234
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,800
Nishikawa

235
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,970
Yeah.

236
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:18,800
Last night when I came back from running an errand...

237
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,810
Forget you saw me!

238
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,060
I only saw him trying to open the door.

239
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,559
He didn't need to get so mad.

240
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,820
I don't understand grown ups.

241
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,419
He put his ear against the door to listen for anyone inside

242
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,480
and looked shocked when he saw something.

243
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,990
Could it be?

244
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,460
Wouldn't that mean we headed in the wrong direction?

245
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,250
In any case, I have to find him.

246
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,810
It could conceivably be A and K.

247
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,570
Mister, did you threaten a boy last night?

248
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,609
He saw you doing something bad, right?

249
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,830
Or rather, something embarrassing.

250
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,200
I knew it.

251
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,090
A large man wearing a mask and sunglasses?

252
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,770
Yeah.

253
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,100
I checked it out, and you were right after all, Mister.

254
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Mori-san?

255
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,239
What does that mean?

256
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,810
What?

257
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:51,100
I, uh, you know...

258
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,540
The weather sure is nice today.

259
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,740
The weather...

260
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,000
That's right.

261
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:03,990
Mamoru-kun was talking about Kitahara-san here.

262
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,490
The true culprit X.

263
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,440
No.

264
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,969
I came to visit my newly wedded daughter's household.

265
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,319
They were going to let me stay with them for a few days.

266
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,510
Last night, I...

267
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,219
You mean to visit room 402 in building K,

268
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,520
but you misremembered the building number as A instead of K.

269
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,669
They know I'm coming.

270
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,839
There should be someone home.

271
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,710
What if something happened to them?

272
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,479
You realized your mistake when you saw the door plate,

273
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
but Mamoru-kun saw you.

274
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,560
Forget you saw me!

275
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,139
I thought my daughter and her husband would laugh at me if he told them,

276
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,489
so I threatened a child.

277
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,170
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,009
In other words...

279
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,479
Kitahara-san had nothing to do with the case.

280
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,300
Then why are you hiding your face?

281
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,459
I have a bit of a cold,

282
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,140
and my eyebrow was shaved off when I went to get a haircut.

283
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,999
So he had nothing to do with it.

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,150
Then who killed Shida and the others?

285
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,260
About that...

286
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,110
It's me.

287
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,980
What?

288
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,950
The weapon was found during a thorough search of the area around the crime scene.

289
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,780
A metal pipe with Mitsumoto Takeshi's blood and hair on it was found near the park.

290
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,569
A knife with Hosaka Yorimitsu's blood was found near his apartment as well.

291
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,609
They found fingerprints on them, too.

292
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,079
Hosaka's were on the pipe, and Shida Yasuho's were on the knife.

293
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,730
What does that mean?

294
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,359
We may eventually find a bag or wrapper with the poison used in Shida's murder, too,

295
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,990
with Mitsumoto Takeshi's fingerprints on it.

296
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,870
Could it be?

297
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,980
Since their fingerprints are on the weapons, we can only assume

298
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,789
Mitsumoto Takeshi was killed by Hosaka Yorimitsu, Hosaka was killed by Shida Yasuho,

299
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,880
and Shida was probably killed by Mitsumoto Takeshi.

300
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,880
In other words...

301
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,890
There is no true culprit X.

302
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,579
The three of them killed each other.

303
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,140
Our first suspicion was correct.

304
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,650
Now we're back where we started.

305
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,400
We should make sure we don't make this kind of mistake again.

306
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,369
Though police and detectives are professionals at logical deduction,

307
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,089
that sometimes makes us read too deeply into situations and head in the wrong direction.

308
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,160
We mustn't assume people unrelated to a case are suspects.

309
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,310
It's a terrible mistake to make.

310
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,050
Some kind of crazy murder could happen here.

311
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,360
This time it's five names connected in a circle.

312
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,180
Stop reading too deeply into things.

313
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,030
C-Could it be?

314
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,870
Ran-neechan, call the police.

315
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,410
Got it.

316
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,580
It's the curse.

317
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,580
It's Anubis' curse.

318
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,090
Anubis must've judged this person guilty.

319
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,210
The next episode of Conan is "The Cursed Museum!"
