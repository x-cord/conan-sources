1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:05,516
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad used our holidays

2
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,116
and first of all came to Kyoto.

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:10,016
We're finally in Kyoto!

4
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:12,416
-How exciting! -Yes!

5
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,416
But we're boarding the ship tomorrow,

6
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,016
and yet why are we here the day before?

7
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:20,616
Well, that's because while we're here in Kyoto,

8
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,916
we may as well enjoy delicious food too, right?

9
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,616
Especially sweets of Kyoto!

10
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:25,716
That's right!

11
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,616
Besides, I can drink local sake

12
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,016
while watching the cherry blossoms at night!

13
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:31,316
Wait a minute!

14
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:32,416
Listen.

15
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,216
We came all the way to Kyoto

16
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:38,416
not to drink liquor or to eat sweets!

17
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:42,416
We came to go onboard and experience a cruise on the Aegis Hotaka!

18
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:46,416
You came as our chaperones!

19
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,316
But...

20
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,716
While we're at it, we may as well...

21
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:51,816
-Right? -Right?

22
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,116
Right!

23
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,616
Talk about off the point...

24
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,916
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

25
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,916
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

26
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,116
A day before the cruise on the Aegis ship experience.

27
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:06,216
A surprising incident occurs in Kyoto.

28
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,716
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:09,716
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:12,216
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,446
"Famed Shop's Sweets Disappears".

32
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:01,846
Rice oil is brushed onto the mold of the Bird of Kyoto to prevent sticking,

33
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:04,546
which after the exclusive batter is poured in.

34
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,946
It looks really good, doesn't it?

35
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:10,546
They don't just look tasty, they are tasty!

36
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:14,446
Even Ran got hooked on it after eating it at my house,

37
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,846
and came all the way here to buy it!

38
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,946
So, this is what you really came for after all.

39
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,846
What? No way!

40
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,546
What's the matter, Ran?

41
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,246
Listen to this, Sonoko!

42
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,946
All the chocolate flavors are sold out!

43
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,646
Don't scare me like that.

44
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:32,446
You scared me out of my wits.

45
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:36,546
But, we stopped over in Kyoto just for that, you know!

46
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,646
But, this isn't the only place

47
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,746
that carries the chocolate flavor, is it?

48
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:42,946
Yes, other us,

49
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,246
you can find them at the shops in Arashiyama, Shiokouji Street,

50
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,446
Shinkyougoku and Shirakawa.

51
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,546
Hey, is it true

52
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:52,146
that all the chocolate flavors disappeared?

53
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:53,946
The chocolate flavors disappeared?

54
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,846
What does disappeared mean?

55
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,146
"Kozo Umehara (63)" -Right, right.

56
00:03:57,146 --> 00:04:00,046
"President of Umehara" -How did such a thing happen?

57
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,446
The thing is, we don't really know.

58
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,746
You don't know?

59
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,246
This morning,

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,446
the craftsmen of Umehara

61
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,846
definitely delivered the items.

62
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:13,646
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

63
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,146
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

64
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,246
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

65
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,046
Okay, thank you.

66
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:21,646
Shall we line them up then?

67
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,446
Huh? You're not finished lining up the items, are you?

68
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:46,346
Huh? Why?

69
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,646
Strange,

70
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:50,146
we certainly lined them up a while ago, didn't we?

71
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,946
Yeah. That's strange.

72
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,446
At any rate, you've got to line them out right away,

73
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,746
or the customers will come.

74
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:02,946
Huh? They're gone. The chocolate flavors are gone.

75
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,246
-What? -What?

76
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,146
Who did it? Where are they?

77
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,546
How come?

78
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,946
And now,

79
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,946
in order to have the items shared from other shops,

80
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:13,346
the craftsmen...

81
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,246
Hey, we've got trouble.

82
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,546
The chocolate flavors have disappeared

83
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,346
from the shops in Shirakawa and Shinkyougoku too!

84
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,446
No good!

85
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,346
Even at the shop in Uzumasa, the chocolate flavors are gone!

86
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:28,646
There are none at Shiokouji Street either.

87
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,146
What?

88
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:33,446
Which means, the chocolate flavors have disappeared from all five shops?

89
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,346
I... I guess so.

90
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:38,846
Is such a thing possible?

91
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:39,846
What's this?

92
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:41,046
What's all the fuss about?

93
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:42,546
Pops!

94
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:45,046
This is no time to be looking for souvenirs!

95
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,546
We've got a case, a case!

96
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,446
They say that the sweets that were here disappeared!

97
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:52,446
You know, I'm a great detective.

98
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,046
It's duck soup for me.

99
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,446
A great detective?

100
00:05:56,446 --> 00:06:00,346
Right! Pops is the famed Kogoro Mouri!

101
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,546
Alias...

102
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,646
That Sleeping Kogoro?

103
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:08,946
Indeed! I am the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

104
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:12,446
Please! Please lend us a hand!

105
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:13,846
Well...

106
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,846
I was going to go drinking under the cherry blossoms of Kyoto from now.

107
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:19,946
Oh, come on, please.

108
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,246
That's right, Dad! It's a grave case!

109
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,046
Grave case?

110
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,246
Hey, hey!

111
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:30,746
Isn't that thing on the ceiling a surveillance camera?

112
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:37,646
The image that is shown is only from 10:00 when the shop was opened.

113
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,046
What?

114
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:43,246
The shelf with the missing sweets is not shown.

115
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:47,346
The Bird of Kyoto is displayed right under the camera.

116
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,646
It's the time that we're realized that the chocolate flavors disappeared.

117
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:54,346
After this, we all looked everywhere in the shop.

118
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:56,546
Can you stop it right there?

119
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,046
What's the matter, Conan?

120
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,646
The person wearing the pink shirt on the upper left side of the screen...

121
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,046
Isn't she a bit strange?

122
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:08,746
Because she went near the shelf of the Bird of Kyoto?

123
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:09,746
No matter how you do it,

124
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,146
it's impossible to steal in such a short time.

125
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:16,446
Besides, she came after the chocolate flavor disappeared.

126
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,246
No, that's not it.

127
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,546
It's pretty cold today, isn't it?

128
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,646
Despite that, she's dressed quite lightly, isn't she?

129
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:28,846
Come to think of it, yes.

130
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:31,446
What's the big deal?

131
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:32,846
Oh, my.

132
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,246
This is a surprise.

133
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,746
Who do I find here but Mr. Mouri?

134
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,946
Who are you?

135
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:44,646
Inspector Ayanokoji from the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department, right?

136
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,546
What brings you to a place like this, Inspector?

137
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:50,546
"Fumimaro Ayanokoji" -Well, it's my day off today, you see,

138
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,746
"Inspector of Kyoto Prefectural" -so I was taking him for a stroll.

139
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:54,746
I see.

140
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,646
Do chipmunks need to take walks?

141
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,846
I wonder.

142
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:02,146
I mean, I don't think he's walking.

143
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,246
But, what good timing to drop by.

144
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,746
It's a burglary case.

145
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,146
It's showtime for the police!

146
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:08,746
I'll leave the rest to you!

147
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,146
Huh?

148
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,646
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:16,246
We'll have some in by tomorrow.

150
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,246
It's still before noon and you're already sold out.

151
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,846
Isn't it a bit too early?

152
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:23,146
We were looking forward to it,

153
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,446
the chocolate-flavored Bird of Kyoto.

154
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:30,846
Can't you make the chocolate flavor from now?

155
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:35,046
We used up all the chocolate for today.

156
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,046
The chocolate that is used for the chocolate flavor

157
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,046
is not something we make here,

158
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:42,546
but we purchase choice selected chocolates from abroad.

159
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:46,546
Tomorrow's one won't come in till tomorrow.

160
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,846
Then, we can't taste the chocolate flavor until tomorrow.

161
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:54,146
No. It's got to be today.

162
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:57,846
It's got to be today? Why?

163
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,946
Today is the memorial day of the previous president.

164
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:06,246
That's why I wanted to start selling the new item today.

165
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,446
I'm sorry. It's all sold out.

166
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,046
Sold out?

167
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,746
What? Already?

168
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:18,346
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

169
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,246
"Ogura"

170
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,646
Is this true?

171
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,946
I see, I understand.

172
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,746
I asked one of my colleagues

173
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:33,646
to interrogate at the shop in Uzumasa.

174
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,746
A shop that carried the Bird of Kyoto?

175
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:39,346
Yes, then they were told that the chocolate flavors disappeared

176
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,646
and someone saw a suspicious car parked in front of the shop.

177
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:45,546
A suspicious car?

178
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:46,946
What about the model and license plate number?

179
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,746
It was a pink compact car

180
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:51,746
and the model nor license plate number are unknown.

181
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:55,146
A pink colored compact car is not sufficient info.

182
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,046
Actually...

183
00:09:57,046 --> 00:10:00,446
I saw a pink compact car too.

184
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,946
You saw it? When?

185
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,146
Let's see. It was when...

186
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:11,446
When we were looking for the chocolate flavors that disappeared.

187
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:12,946
You saw it too?

188
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,946
Yes, it was parked in front of the shop.

189
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,746
But...

190
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,946
If we could only find out what the license plate number is...

191
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,646
If so, why not ask the other shops too?

192
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:24,846
Huh?

193
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:28,046
Because if the driver of the car is the culprit,

194
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,946
she could've been witnessed at the other shops too, right?

195
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,846
Okay, then send officers out to ask around!

196
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,146
Hey, wait a minute.

197
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,846
If that many men are needed,

198
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,446
please ask the burglary division with jurisdiction over this area for help.

199
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,946
After all, I'm off-duty today.

200
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:45,146
Talk about being petty.

201
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,646
I'll go over to the shop on Shiokouji Street.

202
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,046
We can't be taking our time, or the culprit will get away!

203
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:54,546
-Okay, I'll go over to Shinkyougoku then! -Yep!

204
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:57,046
You go to the remaining shop in Shirakawa, okay, Dad?

205
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,346
What?

206
00:10:58,346 --> 00:10:59,746
Mr. Ayanokoji,

207
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,946
can you wait here for contact from everyone?

208
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,846
Huh? Me too?

209
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,346
Listen,

210
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,546
Ayumi go with Ran,

211
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,446
Genta go with Sonoko

212
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:12,246
and Mitsuhiko go with Pops.

213
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,046
Get the license plate number of the car,

214
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:17,546
be it in fragments and contact me on it.

215
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,146
-Okay! -Understood!

216
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,646
I'll connect everything together!

217
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,252
It's a pink compact car.

218
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,752
Come to think of it, it was parked in front of the shop.

219
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,952
Really? What was the license plate number?

220
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,652
Huh? I didn't look...

221
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,852
Just a little will do.

222
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,352
If you remember any number, let me know.

223
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,352
But...

224
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:47,952
I think it was a Shiromi number.

225
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,352
Thank you very much!

226
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:51,852
I saw it, I did.

227
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:54,152
I think it was a Shiromi number

228
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:57,852
and the top was "one, one". That's all I remember.

229
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:00,052
The top was "one, one", right?

230
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,052
But to think that it disappeared from all the shops...

231
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:06,452
Does anything ring a bell?

232
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:11,552
It could be the curse of the previous president who passed away.

233
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:17,252
"Shirakawa" -Conan, Mitsuhiko here.

234
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:23,252
The only info I got was that the number 8 was towards the end.

235
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:25,252
The number "8" towards the end, right?

236
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:26,752
I got it!

237
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:27,952
I see.

238
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,952
A pink compact car,

239
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:32,252
and if we know that much of the license number,

240
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,252
maybe we can carry out a user inquiry.

241
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:46,452
We found the user of the car that was witnessed.

242
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:50,652
Her name is Mako Kawasumi, 22 years old, who lives in Shromi in Osaka.

243
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,852
Have you ever heard of her?

244
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,552
-No. -Not at all.

245
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,752
It's a name I've heard for the first time.

246
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:00,152
I see. At any rate,

247
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,552
we're having that position of the car

248
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:04,152
tracked by the N system right now.

249
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:05,152
Okay.

250
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:09,152
You guys...

251
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,552
Eat too, Conan.

252
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:13,352
Sonoko bought it for us!

253
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,552
The maccha is good!

254
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:17,552
You think so too, don't you?

255
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:21,152
I got hooked on the Bird of Kyoto after eating this flavor too.

256
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:25,352
But it seems that the previous president didn't like it.

257
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,552
To begin with, the Bird of Kyoto

258
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,152
originally started with only the ogura flavor,

259
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:35,152
but the current president started selling the maccha flavor.

260
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,252
So, maybe they started the chocolate favor

261
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,852
because the maccha flavor had a good reputation?

262
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:44,952
That's why the craftsmen at Shinkyougoku...

263
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,452
If the previous president hears of the chocolate flavor,

264
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,152
he'll probably die of shock.

265
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,952
That's what he said.

266
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:55,252
So, maybe this is...

267
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,252
a curse!

268
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:00,252
Cut it out, Sonoko!

269
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,652
Ouch.

270
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,352
I forgot how much Ran hated ghosts.

271
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,452
Sorry.

272
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:18,352
Inspector Ayanokoji!

273
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,752
Detective Kurumazaki.

274
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:21,252
Good work.

275
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,352
"Detective Kurumazaki of Kyoto Prefectural" -10 minutes ago, the car

276
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:28,152
is shown on the N system camera on Marutacho Street.

277
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,652
It's near the shop in Shirakawa.

278
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,852
Yes.

279
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:34,052
And, this is the picture.

280
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:38,752
This is...

281
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:44,152
The woman in the pink shirt.

282
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:47,352
Mitsuhiko, are you still at the shop in Shirakawa?

283
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,652
Yes, I am.

284
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:53,552
Because Mr. Mouri has started drinking and won't move.

285
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,652
So, I'm told...

286
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,452
That drunkard!

287
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:08,452
Where are you going, Ran?

288
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,052
I'm going to grab him by the neck and bring him back!

289
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:13,752
Oh, no. We be seeing bloody rain.

290
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,152
We sure will.

291
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:16,552
Miss.

292
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,852
What're you going to do with that?

293
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,052
This?

294
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,452
I'm going to change it

295
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,052
because this part is a bit soggy.

296
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:25,252
The box back then...

297
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:30,052
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

298
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:31,952
"Ogura"

299
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:34,952
Hey! Will you show me that?

300
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:40,252
So, this is the Bird of Kyoto that you took out from below

301
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,352
to replenish the stock.

302
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,752
On this side is the Bird of Kyoto that you're going to change

303
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,452
because it got soggy with tears.

304
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:50,752
And this is the Bird of Kyoto ogura flavor that was lined out in front.

305
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,952
Isn't it a little smeared?

306
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,452
I wonder if it got that way when the seal was pasted on.

307
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:58,852
But, look,

308
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:01,452
the seal of the one that you took out to replenish,

309
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:03,652
isn't smeared.

310
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,552
Conan, what's bothering you?

311
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:11,752
Maybe I was grossly mistaken.

312
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,352
Uncle Kogoro!

313
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:18,852
Let's go back to where Conan and the others are, already.

314
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,652
I keep telling you,

315
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,252
what's the rush?

316
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:29,452
It's no big deal of a case anyway, so...

317
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,652
It's no big deal?

318
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,452
Yes, that's right.

319
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,152
It's no big deal of a case!

320
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,652
You've got a lot of nerve drinking

321
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:43,352
in the midst of a case, don't you?

322
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,152
No, wait...

323
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:46,552
Ran, it's not what you think!

324
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,052
I...

325
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,552
The cherry blossoms are...

326
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:52,352
The cherry blossoms are pretty! -Uncle Kogoro...

327
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:54,652
That person...

328
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,552
Excuse me.

329
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,952
You've gone to all the shops, haven't you?

330
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,752
To all the shops that carry the Bird of Kyoto.

331
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:07,052
Why? Why?

332
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,452
And in all the shops,

333
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:11,652
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

334
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:17,652
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,552
Mr. Mouri...

336
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,952
Huh? Mr. Mouri's not here yet?

337
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,852
Pops says he'll be back soon.

338
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,752
And, how was it?

339
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,852
Just as Mr. Mouri had said on the phone,

340
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,852
something strange was detected here.

341
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,652
Could that by chance be...

342
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,752
What? Yes, that's right!

343
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,252
How'd you know?

344
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,852
Well, Pops Mouri told me that maybe.

345
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:47,552
Well, well,

346
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,452
a great detective he is indeed.

347
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:52,452
Mr. Mouri.

348
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:05,152
What happened, Mr. Mouri?

349
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,452
I happened to punish the drunkard a bit,

350
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,052
and this is the outcome.

351
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,952
Don't worry about it at all.

352
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,652
A bit, huh?

353
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:15,552
Well, I guess it serves him right.

354
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,352
Oh, by the way, where's Kurumazaki?

355
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:23,352
He was being asked to do something by Pops Kogoro a while ago.

356
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:29,452
Mr. Mouri, what did you ask Kurumazaki to do?

357
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:31,752
More than that, Inspector Ayanokoji,

358
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,552
did you check on it?

359
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,552
The packages of Ogura flavored boxes

360
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:37,152
that were line out in the shop.

361
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,252
Yes.

362
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:42,752
Rice oil was found around the ogura flavor seals.

363
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,052
Rice oil?

364
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:48,452
We use rice oil as a parting agent at our shop.

365
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:53,752
Hey, what's a parting agent?

366
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,152
It's oil that is brushed onto the mold

367
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:57,552
before that batter is poured into the mold

368
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,552
so that it comes off easily after it's cooked.

369
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:04,452
But why would that be on the ogura seals?

370
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,652
It wasn't on the seals.

371
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,952
It was put on, deliberately.

372
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:11,652
Before the ogura seals were pasted on.

373
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,452
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

374
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,952
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

375
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,052
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

376
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:18,852
Okay, thank you.

377
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:21,452
Shall we line them up then?

378
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:27,652
First, 10 boxes of each flavor are lined out.

379
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:28,652
Which means

380
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:31,852
all the needs to be rigged are the 10 chocolate flavor boxes.

381
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:34,652
Holding cotton with rice oil soaked on it in the palm of the hand,

382
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:38,352
the chocolate seal is traced and peeled off.

383
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,352
Then, a new ogura seal is pasted on.

384
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,252
Two people work on the 10 boxes.

385
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:45,852
The first boxes of ogura that are lined out

386
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,752
are put in the drawer for replenishment

387
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:51,152
and the ogura boxes that have been re-sealed are moved over.

388
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:53,052
In other words, in this shop...

389
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,652
Rather,

390
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,452
in all the 5 shops,

391
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,752
there were no chocolate flavors to begin with.

392
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:03,452
Detective Mouri!

393
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,152
Officer Kurumazaki!

394
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,752
Just as Detective Mouri had said,

395
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,952
in the workshop refrigerator of Umehara,

396
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,452
the chocolates that were scheduled to be used today

397
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,452
were left as is!

398
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:16,852
In other words,

399
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:20,252
no chocolate-flavored ones were made to begin with today.

400
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,252
The only ones who can do something like this...

401
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:25,852
are the sweets craftsmen!

402
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,452
Why did you do something like this?

403
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:38,452
The previous president really hated the maccha flavor.

404
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:41,352
The more so with chocolate flavor.

405
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,852
You do something like this just for that reason?

406
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:45,352
It's not just for a reason like that!

407
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,852
It's nothing like that.

408
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:50,752
That's the very reason why we didn't want to sell

409
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:54,152
the chocolate flavor on the former president's memorial day.

410
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,452
But...

411
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:58,052
we had no idea that it would turn out to be something so serious.

412
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,752
We're very sorry.

413
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:32,752
Are you sure it's okay?

414
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,552
You don't want to file charges.

415
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,652
The former president left behind

416
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:39,152
the skills of those craftsmen to me.

417
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:40,352
I see.

418
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,752
So, what's going to happen to the chocolate flavor?

419
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,352
I won't be selling maccha and chocolate

420
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,752
on the memorial day of the former president.

421
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:50,752
Until the craftsmen come out from their side and allow it.

422
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:56,952
But I got to like the Bird of Kyoto from the maccha flavor.

423
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,552
Thank you.

424
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:03,352
Huh? By the way, where's Mitsuhiko?

425
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:05,552
Hey, everybody!

426
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:06,852
Mitsuhiko!

427
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,152
What're you doing?

428
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,752
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,452
Well, you see...

430
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:16,652
Why? Why?

431
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,652
And in all the shops,

432
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:22,652
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

433
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,452
Right!

434
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:27,752
There are no chocolate flavors anywhere!

435
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,152
Huh?

436
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,352
This is the third shop.

437
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:33,352
I've searched so hard and yet...

438
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,552
Why aren't there any anywhere?

439
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:39,652
She's just like Ran, no?

440
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,952
"Next Episode"

441
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:48,252
I wonder where Kengo disappeared to though.

442
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,752
Okay, shall we all go then?

443
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:00,952
Ridiculous! It can't be.

444
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,952
He couldn't be dead.

445
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:06,852
Hey! What do you mean by he couldn't be dead?

446
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:08,452
Next Conan,

447
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:11,352
"A Rose in a Vineyard".

448
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:30,152
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,652
"Type of grape".

450
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:34,052
The movie will start today!

451
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,652
The Sleeping Kogoro is the star of the movie!

452
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,052
You never learn.
