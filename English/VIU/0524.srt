1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,420
Let's go to the hospital!

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,720
Ran?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,120
Let's go to the hospital

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,820
and after you're well,

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,820
you're going to have to tell me

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,420
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,020
Ran.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,020
I feel too, that your deduction

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,220
may be right.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,920
That's why...

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,320
That's why until you go to the hospital,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,720
I'm never going to let go. Never let go!

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Shinichi.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,220
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived,

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,320
the table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,020
The condition set for the engagement was to stop smoking.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,320
But an unexplainable explosion occurs.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,820
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

21
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,715
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 1)".

22
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:38,515
Ran, wake up! Ran!

23
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,115
Conan?

24
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,715
Why?

25
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,615
-Is your cold okay? -Yes.

26
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,815
Heiji and the others left for the airport

27
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:54,715
to go back to Osaka on Mr. Mouri's car.

28
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,015
I see.

29
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:59,415
By the way, Ran.

30
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:01,615
Won't you please let go of my hand already?

31
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:06,215
I'm sorry, did it hurt?

32
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,415
Not at all!

33
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:09,915
But that's strange.

34
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,615
I was holding on to Shinichi's hand,

35
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,015
but I suddenly felt faint and...

36
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:19,415
That's because I shot you with this spare tranquilizer gun.

37
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,415
It's probably because you were really tired,

38
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,315
but you kept holding his hand all the way.

39
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:30,015
Even after Shinichi carried you into this car.

40
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,615
Where's Shinichi? Is he also in Dad's car?

41
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:36,715
No, after riding with us for a while,

42
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,115
he got better

43
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:42,815
and left to finish a case that he was working on.

44
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:46,015
Which means he brushed my hand away and left?

45
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,215
That deduction freak prince.

46
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:49,815
Freak prince...

47
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,615
But how vexing,

48
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:55,615
after I swore that I would never let go...

49
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:00,515
How stupid. Take a good look

50
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:03,215
at the left side of Shinichi's sweater.

51
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,515
It's cut from the top of the sleeve to the bottom

52
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,115
and fastened together with a safety pin.

53
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:12,615
That's proof that he wore his sweater with his left hand blocked.

54
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:16,615
So, you have no reason to feel vexed.

55
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,415
Oh, no. A cold again?

56
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:25,115
Nope! I'm fine! Just fine.

57
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,815
Thanks to the little lady putting the lady of the detective agency

58
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,615
to sleep with the tranquilizer gun.

59
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,115
You succeeded in keeping your secret despite holding her hands

60
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:43,715
as well as shrinking again in the car.

61
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,315
Holding hands?

62
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,115
Who did you hear about it from?

63
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:50,715
I heard about it from an old man called Agasa on the phone.

64
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:53,915
Doc, you didn't have to tell him.

65
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:57,115
And? Did you get that drug?

66
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,115
The one that would make your body normal again.

67
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:04,015
It's better to have that drug on you just in case, right?

68
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,515
Yeah, I think so too.

69
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,615
Hey, you guys! Didn't I tell you not to look?

70
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,415
Hey, Kudo.

71
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,415
Never mind. Ignore that.

72
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,215
We're all on the way to go camping.

73
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,515
And? And then what happened?

74
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:29,515
I told Ai to give me 100 tablets of the drug for now.

75
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,315
Hundred?

76
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,615
Yeah.

77
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,715
I thought it wouldn't be enough unless I had that many but...

78
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,615
I already warned you

79
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,215
that each time you drink that drug,

80
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,815
the more your body will build up resistance to it,

81
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,915
and it will become more and more ineffective.

82
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:46,615
Don't blame me if you eventually really won't be able

83
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:48,715
to get back your adult body.

84
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,015
Well, but for you who wants to look good

85
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,515
in front of that girl at the detective agency,

86
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:58,315
even a 100 tablets isn't going to last you a week.

87
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,515
How dare she talk like that?

88
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,115
Hey, Kudo.

89
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,915
The little lady said that it's not good,

90
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,715
but isn't it better for you

91
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:10,115
to tell the detective agency lady the whole truth?

92
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,515
You probably want to tell her how you really feel too, don't you?

93
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:16,215
Idiot! It's nothing like that,

94
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:18,115
and I can't let things go that way!

95
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,715
What can't you let go?

96
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,515
Aren't you going camping?

97
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,115
Oh, no. Well...

98
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,615
Idiot! I'm going camping in the mountains,

99
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,915
there's no way there'll be a squid there.

100
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,315
You're talking about something like that on the phone?

101
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,715
No, I'm finished talking on the phone.

102
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,215
Hey! Hold it.

103
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:46,215
He hung up.

104
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:47,715
Geez.

105
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,515
I'm so excited about the camping grounds we're headed for!

106
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:56,715
Yes! It seems like a place with nice scenery.

107
00:06:56,715 --> 00:07:00,015
By the way, what would you like for dinner tonight?

108
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,415
I bought a lot of foodstuffs along!

109
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,215
Okay, I want a barbecue then!

110
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,115
That's what you always want, Genta!

111
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,215
Conan, what about you?

112
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,315
I guess the usual, curry over rice.

113
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,615
What about you, Ai?

114
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:13,915
I don't really care.

115
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,515
Anything that's edible is fine with me.

116
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,715
Oh, no sweat!

117
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,915
It seems she's been this way all the way from this morning.

118
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:26,115
I'm sure she's upset over something that's not worth worrying over again.

119
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:40,215
Don't tell me you ran out of gas again?

120
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:43,715
Didn't you have your car checked before you left?

121
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:48,215
Yeah, so the engine's working just great,

122
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:51,015
but I guess I ran out of gas.

123
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:55,315
Well, it's almost sundown,

124
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:58,515
so let's hurry and call somebody to bring gasoline here to us.

125
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:02,315
Yeah. I thought so too, and was just about to call him.

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,315
Him?

127
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,415
Remember, the man who lives next door to me

128
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:11,315
since the fire incident the other day, Subaru Okiya.

129
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,815
He told me that he was going to be home all day today

130
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,515
without anything to do.

131
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,815
I'm sure he can get here in less than two hours.

132
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,015
This place is out of service range of the cell phone!

133
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:24,415
What're we supposed to do out in the mountains like this?

134
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:25,915
There's still some distance to go

135
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,915
before the camping grounds, is there?

136
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:32,515
Well, we've got three choices.

137
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,015
We can walk back to the service station

138
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:37,315
that we passed by 30 minutes ago,

139
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:40,015
buy gasoline and come back.

140
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:43,515
We can wait here till a car comes by

141
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:47,315
and have that car take us to a service station

142
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:48,915
or...

143
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,815
we could go up to that villa on top of the mountain

144
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,615
and borrow the phone.

145
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:57,115
Well, to go back to the service station,

146
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,815
it would take more than two hours.

147
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:02,915
It would be pretty tough waiting here for a car to pass by

148
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:06,015
because we virtually saw no oncoming cars on our way here.

149
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:09,415
So, I think it's best we go up to that villa

150
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,815
where the light is on.

151
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,515
It's a nice house!

152
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,615
A place where a princess would be living!

153
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:18,715
I wonder if they'll serve us gorgeous food when we get there?

154
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,115
Like a full course French dinner?

155
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:23,315
I prefer Italian!

156
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:26,015
I thought we came to go camping, you guys.

157
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,615
Stop! Stop! Stop!

158
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,715
Is anything wrong?

159
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,215
I'm very sorry,

160
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,915
but could you give me a ride to the nearest service station?

161
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,615
"Goki Sudo (34), IT Company President" -Yes, I don't mind,

162
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,515
but will you give me a bit more detailed information?

163
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:58,315
Well, we're on our way to the camping ground

164
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,915
but ran out of gasoline.

165
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,415
This place is also out of service range of the cell phone,

166
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:05,515
so we were at a loss what to do.

167
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:08,015
I see, so that's the story.

168
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,815
Then,

169
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,015
why don't you stay here forever?

170
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,415
Old fart!

171
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,315
What's with that guy?

172
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:24,715
What a snob!

173
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,515
He's the pits!

174
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,715
Well, we may have to ask that snob

175
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:31,815
to do us a favor again, though.

176
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,715
What? Why?

177
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,115
That car just now

178
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:37,715
is a classic car that's preferred by the rich

179
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:40,415
and requires ridiculously high maintenance cost.

180
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,115
A guy driving around in that kind of car

181
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:46,915
may just be the same guy that built an extravagant villa like that

182
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:49,515
out in the mountains, so...

183
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,815
No way!

184
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,715
Let's not ask a guy like him!

185
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:55,015
Yeah.

186
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,615
I would rather

187
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,615
just wait here for another car to come by than ask someone like him.

188
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:02,715
Well, there's a possibility that the man we just saw

189
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:06,315
was heading for a totally different place and not that villa.

190
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:09,215
I don't think it'll hurt to at least give it a try?

191
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,915
That's right.

192
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:14,115
Let's leave our luggage in the car and go there.

193
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,815
Right, maybe if we all ask together...

194
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:21,015
We should at least take a flashlight along with us too, then.

195
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,115
It's getting dark.

196
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,715
There's one in the pocket behind the driver's seat,

197
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:26,715
so will you get it for me?

198
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,515
Okay, sure!

199
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,015
What's with you?

200
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:34,715
Acting like a queen and all.

201
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,315
Is that what it looks like to you?

202
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,415
I don't know what's got into you,

203
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,015
but we're out camping, you know.

204
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:46,115
An explosion?

205
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,815
That... that is...

206
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:56,615
the emblem that was on the car we just saw!

207
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:01,915
Conan?

208
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:03,615
If it was the car we just saw,

209
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,515
why'd it explode?

210
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,215
Was it loaded with explosives to begin with?

211
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,915
Then, is it that he didn't let us on,

212
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,715
because he didn't want us to get mixed up in the explosion?

213
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,815
That can't be. He didn't look that way at all.

214
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,915
Goki!

215
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:27,015
No, Ena! It's dangerous!

216
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:28,615
But...

217
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,115
The fire station and ambulance have already been contacted!

218
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:32,515
No!

219
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:33,815
Ena!

220
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:36,815
Is that Goki that you're calling...

221
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,515
The one with brown hair, has a beard on his chin,

222
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,415
was wearing a white wool sweater and a black fleece jacket?

223
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:44,315
Who are you?

224
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,915
I happened to pass a person driving a classic car

225
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:50,115
that looked just like him a while ago.

226
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,818
The victim is Mr. Goki Sudo, age 34.

227
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:04,418
I hear he's the president of an IT business,

228
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:08,818
that brought him a lot of cash which after he built this villa.

229
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:10,318
The cause of the fire

230
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,818
was a cigarette that he was holding in his mouth.

231
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,018
A cigarette he was holding in his mouth?

232
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:16,418
Yeah, a poly tank in the garage

233
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,518
just happened to be knocked over

234
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,618
and the gasoline that had vaporized was all over the garage

235
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,718
when Mr. Sudo came along in his car.

236
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,918
He opened the door of the garage

237
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:27,618
and parked his car inside

238
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:30,818
with a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

239
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:33,918
The minute he got off the car, he caught fire.

240
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:37,118
The fire enveloped his car too and boom!

241
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,818
A burnt black cigarette butt was found too.

242
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,418
That can't be!

243
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:45,818
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Goki said that he quit smoking!

244
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,318
For me, because I don't like cigarettes.

245
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,418
And who are you?

246
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,618
She's Ena Ginbayashi, Sudo's fiance.

247
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,318
Every weekend,

248
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,818
we all gather here to have a party,

249
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,818
but tonight, Sudo said that he would be announcing something.

250
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:04,118
It's about our wedding.

251
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:08,018
He was scheduled to announce the date of our wedding

252
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:11,418
because it's been set!

253
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:15,418
And yet... And yet what a terrible thing to have happened.

254
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:20,118
The burnt remains of a marriage registration were found.

255
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:22,718
So I guess that's true.

256
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:27,218
But I think he lied to you about quitting smoking.

257
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:31,718
There were a lot of cigarette butts in the ashtray of his car

258
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:35,418
and near his body, there was a cigarette butt that was burnt black too.

259
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,018
There was a bag on the ground

260
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:42,218
and inside it there were an unopened box of cigarettes and a lighter.

261
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,018
No... no way.

262
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:47,118
I just told him a while ago, to please not smoke too.

263
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:48,418
A while ago?

264
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:50,518
Just about an hour ago,

265
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:55,318
I got a call from Goki saying that he was headed this way.

266
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:57,918
That's when Ena told him,

267
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,518
"If you don't quit smoking,

268
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,818
I'm calling off the engagement."

269
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,818
Was that call really from Mr. Sudo?

270
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:07,518
Yes, I'm the one who answered the phone,

271
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:10,018
and I got on the line again before hanging up too.

272
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:12,418
Which means on top of not quitting smoking,

273
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:16,618
he used poly tanks that are not recommended for storing gasoline.

274
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,918
In other words, he brought it upon himself.

275
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,318
This case is definitely an accident.

276
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,618
No, you can't really say that.

277
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:24,618
What?

278
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:28,918
Because if Mr. Sudo got off the car with a lighted cigarette in his mouth,

279
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:33,118
he would've had to light his cigarette a while before he got off, right?

280
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:38,618
But the unsealed box of cigarette hasn't been found anywhere.

281
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:43,218
That's right, isn't it, forensic officer?

282
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:44,818
Is... is that true?

283
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,018
Yes, nothing's been found anywhere,

284
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,918
neither in the car nor in the garage.

285
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:51,818
But why isn't it around?

286
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,418
It could be because that cigarette butt

287
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:57,918
was on the ground of the garage before Mr. Sudo came.

288
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:01,818
Hey, Conan!

289
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,618
Just what do you mean?

290
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:05,418
Please explain!

291
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:07,518
This is not a plain accident,

292
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,718
but rather an accident that's been set up.

293
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,118
This could be a case of homicide.

294
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,118
Are you serious, Conan?

295
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,218
Yeah.

296
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:18,618
The poly tank that was in the garage

297
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,618
happened to be knocked over.

298
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:24,418
The gasoline vaporizes and fills the entire garage.

299
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:28,518
Then Goki comes along in his car and goes into the garage.

300
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,218
He stops his car

301
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:31,218
and holds a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

302
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:33,518
He catches fire as soon as he gets out of the car

303
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,218
and it explodes.

304
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:40,118
The cigarette butt that was the cause of the fire

305
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:43,018
was found in the garage.

306
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,318
At first glance,

307
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,718
it looks to be nothing but an accident,

308
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,018
but if the unsealed cigarette box

309
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:53,018
that he took the cigarette out of isn't anywhere in sight,

310
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:54,618
the cigarette butt

311
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,918
must've been here in the garage

312
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:59,518
even before Mr. Sudo got to the garage.

313
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:02,518
It could be mistaken evidence

314
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,718
that the culprit deliberately left behind,

315
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:07,018
to make this look like an accident.

316
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,018
Wow, Conan!

317
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:11,718
Just as expected of you!

318
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,518
But sonny,

319
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:16,318
we've been investigating inside the garage for a while now

320
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,918
but nothing like an igniting device was found.

321
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:25,118
But Mr. Sudo didn't have a cigarette case on him either, did he?

322
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,218
No.

323
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,318
If so, something's just not right.

324
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,718
If you check closer, I'm sure something would come up.

325
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,918
It was his last cigarette.

326
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:37,418
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

327
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,118
out the window of the car before coming into the garage

328
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:43,018
because that was going to be his last cigarette?

329
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:49,518
Goki used to always crumple up empty cigarette boxes and do so.

330
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,518
So, if we look around the area of this villa,

331
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,718
we'd be able to find empty cigarette boxes?

332
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,418
I guess so.

333
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,718
But I think it's been a while

334
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,918
since he threw away empty boxes of cigarettes.

335
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:05,618
If Goki lied about not smoking anymore,

336
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,418
don't you think he would avoid disposing the butts around the villa?

337
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:12,618
If that's the case, we'll have to investigate a wide area,

338
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:14,618
and that'll be a hell of tough work.

339
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:18,118
There was a deep valley alongside the road too.

340
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,218
But that's all I can come up with.

341
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,918
Hey, Miss.

342
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:25,918
Do you really believe that Mr. Sudo quit smoking?

343
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:31,318
If you knew that Mr. Sudo was smoking in secret,

344
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,318
all you had to do

345
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:34,818
was knock down the poly tank in the garage with the gasoline inside.

346
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,218
What do you think you're saying?

347
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:40,018
Nobody noticed Mr. Sudo smoking in secret!

348
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,218
Yes!

349
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,818
After he said he was going to quit smoking,

350
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,818
he didn't smoke at all!

351
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:48,418
But that's only in front of you people, right?

352
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,918
We met Mr. Sudo a little before the incident

353
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,218
but since he would easily lie about anything,

354
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,218
I thought that you as his fiance

355
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,518
would've known about it.

356
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,318
Easily lie?

357
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:04,518
Yes, on our way to the camping grounds by car,

358
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,518
we happened to run out of gas,

359
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:10,318
so we stopped Mr. Sudo's car that happened to pass by.

360
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:14,318
I asked him if he would drive me to the service station but...

361
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:16,018
He was a real snob!

362
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:17,718
When doc went over to the driver's seat

363
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:19,118
and explained the situation to him...

364
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,318
At first, he said he give us a lift and yet!

365
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,518
He gave a super snide remark and drove off.

366
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:28,718
Why don't you stay here forever? Old fart!

367
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:31,518
Hey, hey, that's terrible!

368
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:34,218
I hate to talk about people who are no longer here,

369
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:36,918
but he really didn't look to be someone who'd be keeping his promise

370
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:39,218
about not smoking.

371
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:42,018
It's true that it's something that Sudo would say, but...

372
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:44,418
I thought that he kept to his promise of not smoking.

373
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:48,118
Yes, because Sudo was head over heels over Ena.

374
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,518
And besides, if he were... That is if...

375
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:54,018
he were to be secretly smoking behind my back

376
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,218
and I found out about it,

377
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:59,818
I did tell him on the phone in front of everyone, before he came here

378
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:05,018
that if he didn't quit smoking, I would nullify our engagement!

379
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:06,918
It's unthinkable that after hearing what I said,

380
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:10,418
he would get off his car holding a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

381
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,318
Do you think I could've foreseen that he would do something like that?

382
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,818
It's just as she says.

383
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:19,618
So long as she told him not to smoke in front of everyone,

384
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,018
it's difficult to prove that this is a case of homicide.

385
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,418
No, the cause of the fire is not the cigarette.

386
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:29,918
I don't know if he really quit smoking or not,

387
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:34,618
but I don't think he was smoking in his car today.

388
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:37,118
When Doc stopped his car,

389
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:39,718
I also went up to the driver's seat,

390
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,018
but he didn't smell of cigarette.

391
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:45,018
Then, why did the fire start in the garage?

392
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:48,118
Beats me, I don't know for sure yet,

393
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:51,818
but I'm pretty sure that Ena is the one who set it up.

394
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,518
Remember?

395
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:02,818
Ena at first cried and bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

396
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,818
who said that the cause of the fire was a lit cigarette.

397
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:08,718
Goki said that he quit smoking!

398
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:12,218
But even before you had time to take that in,

399
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:13,218
in answer to my remark

400
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:17,118
that it's strange that no unsealed box of cigarettes is around...

401
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,218
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

402
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:22,318
out the window of the car before coming into the garage.

403
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:26,318
If she really believed that he had quit smoking,

404
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,318
she would've agreed with my remark, right?

405
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:33,118
And said something like, "See, so he quit smoking after all!"

406
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:34,618
True.

407
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:38,318
However, if her contradictory remark

408
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:41,218
was that of the culprit, it makes sense.

409
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,418
She bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

410
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,618
because she wanted to appeal the fact that

411
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,318
she didn't know Goki was smoking behind her back.

412
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,818
And she argued back at me saying that the cause of the fire

413
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:52,918
was unmistakably from a lighted cigarette,

414
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:56,118
because that what she wanted to get through.

415
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:58,718
It seems that Ena wants to make it look like

416
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:01,718
"an accidental fire that was caused by a lighted cigarette" no matter what.

417
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:04,318
What? So, it's not an accident after all?

418
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:06,818
Are you saying that the fire ignited by itself?

419
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,418
But there's a saying that goes,

420
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:10,718
"No smoke rises, where there is no fire", isn't there?

421
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:14,018
That's why I'm thinking that over now.

422
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:15,918
There's got to be something!

423
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:19,618
A trick that can be used

424
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:22,518
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

425
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:48,218
"Next episode"

426
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,318
That's the emblem of Goki's car.

427
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:57,118
A classic car, a wool sweater.

428
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,818
Stopping over...

429
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:01,418
I see. That's why it's the classic car.

430
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:07,318
She had schemed to make Mr. Sudo himself

431
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:10,018
the ignition device!

432
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,418
Next Conan,

433
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,518
"Blue Fireworks of Hate (Part 2)".

434
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:28,118
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,318
"Wool sweater".

436
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:31,718
There's a fuzzball on your sweater.

437
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:32,918
That because it's wool.

438
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,118
There's a price tag on your sweater.

439
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:35,518
That's because it's a bargain sale.
