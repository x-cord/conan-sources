1
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:03,641
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:05,741
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,741
A soundless murder within the dark.

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,741
A clean deduction of a messed up crime site.

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,141
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:13,141
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:15,142
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:58,895
We all head over together with mom to the Tohto Processing Station

9
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:01,696
to watch the preview of the new movie, "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

10
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:06,395
However, it ends up that the preview that was scheduled

11
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,296
could only be shown late at night, so we had to wait.

12
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:12,053
Mom goes back to the U.S.

13
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:15,754
while we all go over to Mr. Akira Hojima's condo to take a nap.

14
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:32,854
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 2)"

15
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,753
The victim is Mr. Norihiro Furumura, age 39.

16
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:40,153
He seems to have been employed at the Tohto Processing Station

17
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,654
located opposite this condo.

18
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:45,453
One stab through the chest with a knife.

19
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,753
He seems to have been stabbed from over the blanket

20
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,353
in order to avoid blood splattering onto the killer.

21
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,153
No.

22
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:55,653
They all just happened to come to take a short nap at my place.

23
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:58,053
We were planning to play all night mahjong

24
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,453
after the movie was completed tonight.

25
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,253
Movie?

26
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,553
Yes.

27
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:06,553
The preview showing of that movie was extended to around 11 pm,

28
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,953
so we all decided to take a short nap together,

29
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,154
including those children.

30
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,453
I see.

31
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:16,653
So, where were you all sleeping?

32
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,553
That room.

33
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:21,553
All five of us lined up sideways and slept on that bed.

34
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:25,453
Then, we heard a man shout.

35
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,453
When we opened the door and turned on the light,

36
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:31,053
this is what we saw.

37
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,853
I see.

38
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,853
But it's strange.

39
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,353
What's strange?

40
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:39,954
We didn't hear the murderer at all.

41
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,353
-That's because you were sleeping... -No.

42
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,553
But it's after Mr. Furumura was killed.

43
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:47,554
It's only natural that

44
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:50,354
we'd at least hear the sound of somebody leaving the room.

45
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:55,753
The killer probably tiptoed out.

46
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:58,953
Well, I think it's almost impossible

47
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:01,653
to run away in such a short time from this dark, messy room

48
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:04,053
without making a sound.

49
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,353
Which means that the killer

50
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,153
is the person who was sleeping next to the sofa

51
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,154
that the victim was sleeping on...

52
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,853
Mr. Hojima.

53
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,053
No way!

54
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:15,153
There were no signs of the door being forced open either.

55
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,753
Wait!

56
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,153
People other than me have the spare key to this room.

57
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,853
People who work at the same processing station as I,

58
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:25,154
like Mr. Karata and Mr. Negami.

59
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,053
What? Furumura was?

60
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,453
By who?

61
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:34,053
We'll soon find out after you all tell us about yourselves.

62
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,253
Will you please tell us

63
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,053
what you were doing and where you were

64
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:39,253
at the time of the murder around 10:55 pm?

65
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:42,553
At that time, since I was almost done with timing,

66
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:45,253
I left the rest of the work with another worker

67
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:47,253
and went to take a rest at the nap room.

68
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,153
Timing?

69
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,953
It involves adjusting the color for movies and dramas.

70
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,253
Can anyone verify that for you?

71
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,653
There were two to three other people there,

72
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,753
but they were all asleep.

73
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,853
And you?

74
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:08,353
I was alone in the dark room checking the film.

75
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:12,353
So, you both don't have an alibi?

76
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,653
No.

77
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:16,653
And? Will you explain why you had a spare key?

78
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:19,553
So that I could play mahjong right away.

79
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,253
The ones who finished work first would come here

80
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:24,753
and get the game set up and all.

81
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:29,153
But maybe we weren't the only ones who had the spare key.

82
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:32,853
He seemed to have other people he played mahjong with, too.

83
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:36,053
But the only people I gave my spare key to are those two

84
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,553
and Mr. Furumura.

85
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:41,153
But if you used to come here

86
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,854
and knew where everything was...

87
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:48,853
It could be possible to move around easily even in the dark.

88
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,754
But...

89
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,053
Conan?

90
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:59,354
See! This room is really pitch dark.

91
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:04,653
Hey, stop that! Don't interfere with the officers!

92
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:06,353
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:09,653
But Conan's right.

94
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:11,053
Right.

95
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,353
If it's that dark, no matter how used to you are to this place,

96
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:15,654
you're bound to bump into something.

97
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,953
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

98
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,354
The 3rd button of the corpse's shirt has been yanked off.

99
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,353
It seems as if the victim has struggled with the killer

100
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,353
before he was stabbed.

101
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:33,453
His shirt sure is dirty though.

102
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,753
His collar is soiled black.

103
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,453
Mr. Furumura used to hate bathing

104
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,653
and used to take baths only once a week or so.

105
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:43,353
Come to think of it, when we played 3 days ago,

106
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,053
he was wearing this shirt, too.

107
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,453
Which means he hasn't changed since then.

108
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,253
I could never do something like this.

109
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,553
I could never struggle with him,

110
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:55,753
yank off his button or stab him in a pitch dark place like this!

111
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:59,453
But if you were the only one awake at that time,

112
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:00,853
you could've confirmed the position of the victim

113
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,753
with a flashlight or something

114
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,254
and approached him, couldn't you?

115
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:10,653
And besides, the children haven't heard the killer running away.

116
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:14,853
Or, did you hear the killer making any sound?

117
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:17,853
No. I was surprised at hearing Mr. Furumura's voice

118
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,753
that I noticed nothing else.

119
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,053
What's that?

120
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,754
Inspector! There's a video camera on the floor.

121
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:29,153
What's with this video camera?

122
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:33,053
This is the video diary that Furumura used to take every day.

123
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,053
Don't tell me the video was kept running all this time.

124
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:39,353
Okay. Connect it to the TV right away and play it.

125
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:41,353
There may be something it in

126
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,853
that would give us a clue to the murder.

127
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:44,054
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,753
Good work all day today!

129
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:51,753
I'm going to give my best shot playing all-night mahjong tonight.

130
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:54,554
I'll report the result later.

131
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,954
It's been switched off once here.

132
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,753
It switched back on again.

133
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:05,754
But it's pitch black and you can't see a thing.

134
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,153
-Inspector! -Yeah.

135
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:11,853
Hey, Mr, Furumura!

136
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,853
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

137
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,953
This is my voice!

138
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,553
That's the sound I made when I opened the bedroom door.

139
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,953
Mr. Furumura!

140
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:24,454
This is where this boy turned on the light.

141
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:29,553
But why did the video camera switch back on again?

142
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:32,053
The impact of the video camera falling to the floor

143
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,253
when he struggled with the killer

144
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,454
probably set it back on again.

145
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:39,253
The problem here though, is the sound.

146
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,853
Until the victim shouts,

147
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,053
Conan opens the door and Ayumi screams,

148
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:49,553
there is no sound other than your voice, Mr. Hojima.

149
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:51,553
Which means that...

150
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,653
No way!

151
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:54,853
If I was planning to do something like this,

152
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,653
I wouldn't have brought these children here to take a nap!

153
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,053
Besides, I have no reason to want to kill Mr. Furumura.

154
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,453
You do.

155
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:05,653
You had a grudge on him for spoiling your precious movie.

156
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:09,053
Oh, the last episode of the series, "Doting Parents' Diary".

157
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:12,353
The same goes for you, right, Mr. Negami?

158
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:15,853
You were really angry too, weren't you, Mr. Karata?

159
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,653
Well, it's true, but...

160
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:20,253
What do you mean? He spoiled your movie?

161
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:22,953
Well, when he was checking the film,

162
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:24,853
Furumura overlooked a scratch,

163
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:29,153
developed it the way it was and cut the film.

164
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:32,253
Because of it, we suffered a great loss.

165
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:35,053
We had to pay for all the retake of the scenes

166
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,553
that were no good after being cut.

167
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:40,053
But film checking is done in the dark room

168
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,053
and is tough work that is done virtually

169
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,953
by the sense of touch of the fingertips, so...

170
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:46,653
It was work that was too hard on him to begin

171
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,753
because he used to play mahjong till early morning almost every day.

172
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:52,653
Checking the film in the dark room...

173
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,553
Mr. Negami. Don't you do that, too?

174
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:58,053
Yes. He used to be a developer before, too.

175
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:03,154
After that incident, Furumura was switched over to sales.

176
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,953
I don't see why three of you need to hold a grudge against him, though?

177
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,653
Were your bonuses decreased, too?

178
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:13,253
That "Doting Parents' Diary" series

179
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:17,253
was the pride and joy of all of us working here.

180
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,953
It's only natural to hold a grudge against him

181
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,953
for damaging the final episode.

182
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,653
Mr. Furumura alone didn't seem too proud about it, though.

183
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:28,553
It's not that we held that much a grudge against him.

184
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:30,953
He was one of the members we played mahjong with, after all.

185
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:34,254
Most of us have forgotten about it already.

186
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:39,354
A soundless murder...

187
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:43,953
From that front door to this door...

188
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:46,954
Even if you were to be able to pass easily with no obstructions...

189
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,453
The toughest part would be this living room.

190
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:54,053
It's virtually impossible to go through here

191
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,054
in a short time without making a sound.

192
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,053
Then, the killer would have to be.

193
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,854
Mr. Hojima, who was here to begin with?

194
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:10,653
Come to think of it! If I remember correctly...

195
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:11,753
I'm sure that...

196
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,354
That video camera was also...

197
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:19,654
I see. That's why he was flustered and did what he did.

198
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:26,253
If so, the unexplained thing about no noise on the video tape

199
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:29,154
and the button that was yanked off all fit in.

200
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:32,553
The killer is probably him.

201
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:34,353
The only one who could've committed the murder

202
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:37,553
in this pitch darkness is him.

203
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:40,153
But I don't have proof.

204
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,353
What now?

205
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:43,654
What do I do?

206
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:48,053
What's the matter, Ai?

207
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,253
You look dreadful.

208
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:53,753
It's nothing, really.

209
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,853
She says it's nothing.

210
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:57,954
Really?

211
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,254
Don't tell me that...

212
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:29,556
So, what we clearly know now is...

213
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:33,380
Mr. Furumura who was sleeping on the sofa around 11 pm

214
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:36,380
was stabbed to death by someone in the dark.

215
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,380
If the killer stabbed Mr. Furumura and fled,

216
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,380
he would've most naturally bumped into something and made noise.

217
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,680
But the children who were sleeping in the next room

218
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,380
heard no noise at all.

219
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,580
Moreover, the video camera

220
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,080
which seemed to have fallen to the floor and switched on

221
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,680
when the killer and Mr. Furumura was thought

222
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:53,480
to have struggled with each other

223
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,480
had no such sound recorded in it.

224
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:58,380
In other words, the killer is the one

225
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,080
who was sleeping next to the sofa where Mr. Furumura was sleeping,

226
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,280
Mr. Hojima.

227
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:06,980
You're the only one I can come up with.

228
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,580
Wait!

229
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,580
Absolutely!

230
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,080
Dr. Agasa?

231
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,580
Doc?

232
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:18,281
Conan called me to ask me to come pick him up.

233
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,780
I heard about the case on the phone.

234
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:27,780
No matter how much I think it over, I come up with just one answer!

235
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:31,081
That there is probably no doubt that Mr. Hojima committed the crime.

236
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,780
An ordinary person wouldn't be able

237
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,480
to move around in the dark without making a sound.

238
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,280
Maybe it'd be a different story

239
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:42,281
if you were a ninja or a ghost, though.

240
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:47,180
Dr. Agasa. You think so, too?

241
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,780
But there is just one thing that bothers me.

242
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:51,781
What?

243
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:55,080
Remember the third button of Mr. Furumura's shirt that was yanked off

244
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,080
when he struggled with the killer?

245
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,180
It hasn't been found yet, has it?

246
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:03,080
Now that you mentioned it, no.

247
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,380
Without it, it just doesn't feel good.

248
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,080
It couldn't be that the button had wings and flew off.

249
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,980
It's probably somewhere in this messy room

250
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,980
or the killer still has it on him.

251
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,480
I'd recommend you to do a thorough body check of Mr. Hojima

252
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,880
when you take him for questioning to the station.

253
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,780
Yes, I will.

254
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,380
Mr. Hojima, please come to the station with me.

255
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:32,180
All right. But I'm not the killer.

256
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:36,080
Then, Mr. Negami and Mr. Karata, let's go too.

257
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,080
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

258
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:39,780
Did I do okay?

259
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:42,380
Yeah, just great.

260
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,380
So, we'll go to the police station for questioning, too.

261
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,680
You all slept once, so you can all stay up, right?

262
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,080
Yes...

263
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,080
Hey, Ai. Let's go!

264
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,780
What? Yes.

265
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,480
But I really wanted to see Yaiba's movie.

266
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,280
-Very true. -Wait...

267
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,280
Let's all go see it together when it's released.

268
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,581
All right then.

269
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,381
Why?

270
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:07,281
Just as I thought. It was you after all, Mr. Negami.

271
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,880
Why?

272
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:14,580
Sound. It was the sound.

273
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:15,780
Sound?

274
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:19,480
But the children said they heard no sound,

275
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,480
the same with the video tape.

276
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,980
Right. It's true that there were no suspicious sounds.

277
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,180
But it was too soundless.

278
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,680
If the video camera dropped to the floor and switched on,

279
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,880
the sound back then of the video camera dropping

280
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,880
or the sound of the struggle should've been recorded.

281
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,480
But since it had no sound,

282
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:41,980
chances are, the killer deliberately pressed the record button

283
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:44,980
and put it on the floor.

284
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,580
It could be that the killer was confident of fleeing

285
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:51,780
from a dark room without making a sound.

286
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:56,180
And your job as a developer also made me suspect you.

287
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,380
Huh?

288
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:00,180
You seemed to have mentioned that

289
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,380
working as a developer requires one to check the scratches on the films

290
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:05,380
only with the sense of touch of the fingertips.

291
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,980
No matter how used to you are to the dark room,

292
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,280
it is impossible to work in a room with no light at all.

293
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,280
That's why I thought you would've had to place some kind of mark

294
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:18,480
in the room to help you locate things even in the dark.

295
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:22,180
And walla! I found it as soon as I entered this room.

296
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,980
Among all the things cluttered in this room, on every corner...

297
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,780
I found these black tapes.

298
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:28,980
What?

299
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:35,080
This probably is black vinyl tape pasted on over fluorescent tape.

300
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,280
See? There are tapes that have peeled off,

301
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:42,080
so the fluorescent tape under them are slightly showing.

302
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,080
Unless light is kept at a low level in this way,

303
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:47,881
the film in the darkroom would probably over expose.

304
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,180
So, an ordinary person can't see right away

305
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,780
when the lights are turned out.

306
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,280
But when their eyes get used to the dark,

307
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,280
they gradually start being able to see.

308
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:00,580
Using this light as a guide and walking carefully,

309
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,181
aware of where everything is located...

310
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:08,380
It's possible to go through without bumping into anything.

311
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:10,480
I happened to change the position of some things,

312
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,680
so you seemed to have panicked a bit this time.

313
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:14,680
That's why when Conan turned off the light,

314
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,980
you turned it right back on, right?

315
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,180
You did so because you didn't want others to get used to the dark

316
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,180
and realize what you had done.

317
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,780
Now that you mentioned it, there is black tape on this video camera, too.

318
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:27,480
Even if he could tell where the camera was,

319
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,980
would he be able to tell where the chest of a person who is asleep is?

320
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:33,180
If the body were to move even a bit,

321
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,780
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

322
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,580
The button.

323
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:39,380
He probably put a bit of fluorescent paint

324
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:42,380
on Mr. Furumura's 3rd button

325
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:46,280
to make out where the chest was even in the dark.

326
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,980
In other words, if you can get into the room with the spare key,

327
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:55,081
you can stab him in the chest even in the dark.

328
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,280
You must've painted the button 3 days ago

329
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:02,880
when you played mahjong all night and he was fast asleep.

330
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:05,780
Knowing that he only takes baths once a week,

331
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:09,280
it's very likely he wouldn't change shirts.

332
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,580
Then, you decided to bring back the button

333
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:14,980
after peeling off the fluorescent paint from it

334
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,480
because if someone finds it, the trick would be revealed.

335
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,180
On top of that, since you heard me say

336
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:22,280
it's strange that the button hasn't been found,

337
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:26,780
you returned the button after peeling off the fluorescent paint.

338
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,280
After Dr. Agasa explained everything to me,

339
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,680
finished questioning you first of all,

340
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,880
and was waiting here in this room,

341
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,480
but I didn't expect this outcome.

342
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:41,380
It's amazing how Mr. Furumura who worked as a developer like you,

343
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,181
didn't notice the fluorescent tapes.

344
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,280
Notice what?

345
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,780
These tapes were pasted on by Furumura himself.

346
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,380
What?

347
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,180
He told me that he pasted the tape onto the video camera

348
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:58,680
so that he could get a hold of it any time in the dark.

349
00:19:58,681 --> 00:19:59,980
He said that he also pasted tape around the room

350
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,880
so that he could find the restroom if he needed to go late at night.

351
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:05,680
He did it as a prank and didn't let Hojima in on it.

352
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:09,080
I always knew that he was unreliable, though.

353
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,680
But I just couldn't forgive him for what he did back then.

354
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,880
When he damaged the film

355
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,480
of the final episode of the series "Doting Parents' Diary",

356
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,180
I just couldn't overlook his mistake!

357
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,980
But you did a retake and the movie was successfully completed, wasn't it?

358
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:25,080
No good. It wasn't perfect.

359
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,080
Because in the original film,

360
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:31,180
the younger brother of the star of the show was also acting in it.

361
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:35,180
But just before the retake, he died in a traffic accident.

362
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,880
So we had no choice but to do without him.

363
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:44,080
That's why that movie is not perfect or ever will be complete!

364
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:45,980
Just because of him!

365
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:47,481
He's to blame!

366
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,680
Doc, thanks for everything!

367
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,080
Hey, hold it.

368
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,280
Come back here then, will you?

369
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,380
Although it's a bit far,

370
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,780
run over here because it's good for your health.

371
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,281
Conan.

372
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't worry.

373
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,580
That cigarette is like a car tooting its horn

374
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:44,380
waiting for the traffic light to change.

375
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:46,880
If you don't want them to be aware of our existence,

376
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,680
let's not toot our horns from our side.

377
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:52,280
The same with the condo they were watching.

378
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:56,080
From what we saw from that window, he was not smoking a cigarette.

379
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,380
If we saw the lit cigarette he was smoking,

380
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:01,480
it would be like we were telling him from our side that we are here.

381
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,080
It's the basics of a stake out.

382
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:08,880
But he just happened to be smoking a cigarette in our view.

383
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:11,480
It's only proof that he lost track of us.

384
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:13,480
Since he's still waiting around here,

385
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:16,780
it means that he probably doesn't have an idea of where we live, right?

386
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,980
I had Officer Takagi deliberately

387
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,780
go through a drunk driving checkpoint,

388
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,880
and bring us all the way here.

389
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:25,280
It's no wonder they lost track of us.

390
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,680
Don't tell me that they're...

391
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:28,780
Beats me.

392
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:32,680
The only thing I'm sure of is that he's not one of my mom's fans.

393
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:37,381
It seems that his target is either you or me.

394
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:41,180
So, we've lost track of them.

395
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:44,080
It's all right. The string hasn't been severed yet.

396
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:45,281
Keep it up.

397
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:48,681
But...

398
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,381
She sure resembles.

399
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,665
"Next Episode."

400
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,565
What is this wound he has here?

401
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:19,164
I see.

402
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,864
I figured out the real truth hidden behind this accident.

403
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:28,565
Next Conan, "The Truth Behind the Death Fall".

404
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,864
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,564
"Receipt."

406
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:49,565
It's been 10 years since this series have begun.

407
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,264
Mr. Aoyama has already written 1 billion comics!

408
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:53,765
This year is Conan's Super Year!
