1
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:16,483
Hey!

2
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:21,683
Four eyes, were you caught for doing something bad?

3
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:24,183
That's not it, Mr. Mouri.

4
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:27,483
He turned in a wallet that he found on the street.

5
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:30,183
What? Bummers.

6
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:32,383
Didn't you go to play pachinko, Pops?

7
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,783
I overslept a bit,

8
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,583
so when I got there all the good machines were taken.

9
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,483
11:30 am.

10
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,583
You overslept more than just a little.

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,583
You brat!

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,183
Excuse me.

13
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:47,883
He's...

14
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:50,883
Aren't you the comedian?

15
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,283
Yes. I'm Rokusuke Dodonpa.

16
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:56,383
The lying stand-up comedian, Dodonpa.

17
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,783
I'm telling you, it's true, everybody!

18
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:04,983
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,583
What brings you here, Dodonpa?

20
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,383
-"Rokusuke Dodonpa (30)" -The talent agency that I belong to

21
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,483
is just up this street.

22
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:16,883
I killed...

23
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:19,183
the president there.

24
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,383
What?

25
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,383
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

26
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:29,283
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

27
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,183
The comedian who turns himself in receives unexpected evaluation.

28
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,983
Something is hidden behind the laughter

29
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,583
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,483
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,883
His name is Detective Conan.

32
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,339
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 1)"

33
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,239
Inspector Megure.

34
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,939
I asked the condominium manager, Mr. Ueki,

35
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,439
to get a vacant room ready for us.

36
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,439
I'm sorry to trouble you.

37
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,939
We're busy at the Beika police station because of other cases.

38
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,939
Please give me the details then, will you?

39
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,439
-Yes, sir. -Let me sit in too.

40
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,439
No need to.

41
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,539
I'm sure that I can be of some kind of help to you.

42
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,539
Besides, you're the world's greatest detective, after all, right?

43
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,239
You must really have a lot of time on your hands.

44
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,939
Stage name, Rokusuke Dodonpa,

45
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,239
proper name, Rokusuke Tanigaki.

46
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,939
Residence at Akebono City, 3-chome.

47
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,439
The late Hideki Tendo was running a talent agency at this address,

48
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,239
which was also his residence.

49
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,839
It seems that the Mr. Dodonpa

50
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,039
was the only talent he had working at his agency.

51
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,039
He was the president as well as my manager.

52
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,639
We were in this together from the start.

53
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,339
He was a precious partner.

54
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,139
And you're saying

55
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,139
that you killed that precious partner of yours?

56
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,239
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:44,039
I was working on a new material this week, you see.

58
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,639
And I had an appointment to show it to him today.

59
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,739
So, I went to his office.

60
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,339
It was around 11:10 am.

61
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,639
There!

62
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,639
I'm telling you, it's true, everybody!

63
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,239
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

64
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,939
-"Hideki Tendo (42)" -That's why your act

65
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,739
is always superficial and shows no growth!

66
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,939
Just what do you mean?

67
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,339
I'm telling you that your act is not even a performance!

68
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,539
You don't know a thing.

69
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,239
What the audience wants is...

70
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,539
We got into an argument over differences in what we consider performance.

71
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,239
I blew my top

72
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,339
and picked up the bat that was left standing

73
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,239
against the wall in the room.

74
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,439
And I...

75
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,439
I'm very sorry.

76
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,139
Judging from the way he is deeply apologetic over what he did,

77
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,639
it seems that his confession is not a lie.

78
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:52,739
-But... -Where is he? That room?

79
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,239
Is it true that Mr. Rokuske Dodonpa

80
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,939
killed the president of the talent agency he belongs to

81
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,239
and turned himself in?

82
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,939
No...

83
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,339
You can't come in!

84
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,239
We're still just hearing him out.

85
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,439
I'll comment on this later!

86
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,239
I'm counting on you.

87
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,039
Let's head home too.

88
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,339
It's just a waste of time staying here any longer.

89
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,039
No matter how angry you get,

90
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,039
would you kill your precious partner with a metal bat?

91
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,039
What?

92
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,539
That's what's bothering me too, Mr. Dodonpa.

93
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,339
Go immediately and find evidence to corroborate his story.

94
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,339
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

95
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,339
You heard him.

96
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,139
Why don't we stay a while longer until everything's confirmed.

97
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,139
There could be a chance for the Great Detective to show his talents too.

98
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,639
I guess so.

99
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,639
"Beika Station"

100
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,939
He arrived at Beika Station at 11 am.

101
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,539
It's about a ten minute walk from the station to the crime scene,

102
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:53,639
so he would've reached the office around 11:10 am.

103
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,239
After a short while, he gets into an argument and kills his partner.

104
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,039
Then, he arrives at the police box in front of the station

105
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,739
and turns himself in at 11:30 am.

106
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,039
As far as the time is concerned, everything fits into place.

107
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,639
Yes, sir. I'll go ask around other vaudevillians.

108
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,339
To see if he had any problems with the victim.

109
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,839
Okay. Do that, will you?

110
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,039
I'll attend the autopsy then.

111
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,339
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,239
I see. Good work.

113
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,839
It's from forensics.

114
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,439
They've confirmed the blood and hair that was found on the bat

115
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,639
belongs to the victim, Hideki Tendo.

116
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,939
Moreover, his prints were also found on the bat.

117
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,239
So, that's the murder weapon, eh?

118
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,239
Like I've been telling you, I struck him with it.

119
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,139
"Beika Theater"

120
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,039
Which means that Mr. Dodonpa

121
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,839
had a grudge against Mr. Tendo because of that?

122
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,839
Of course I'd hold a grudge against him.

123
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,639
After all, I got an offer to perform

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,239
on a popular variety show, and yet...

125
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,539
He turned it down without even asking me,

126
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,239
saying he didn't like that program.

127
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:08,739
In other words, you were in conflict with Mr. Tendo since then.

128
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:12,839
I'm sure that also helped trigger losing my temper.

129
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,739
Otherwise, I would've never impulsively struck him with a bat.

130
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,039
Under all these circumstances,

131
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,339
I don't think there's any room for doubt.

132
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,039
Maybe my suspicions are groundless.

133
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,139
"Tendo Talent Agency"

134
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:37,839
There's something about him.

135
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,839
What's wrong, manager?

136
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:45,939
What?

137
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,139
When I cleaned this back entrance area this morning, it wasn't here.

138
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,539
This thing.

139
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,139
A steel pipe?

140
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,039
It's used at construction sites, right?

141
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,439
I wonder who brought it here?

142
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,839
What time did you start cleaning up this morning?

143
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,439
Officer Takagi?

144
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,339
That's not it?

145
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,339
No, sir.

146
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,339
What's wrong, Inspector?

147
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,539
The murder weapon!

148
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,439
It wasn't the metal bat.

149
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,639
During the autopsy,

150
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,039
after matching the shape of the wound to that metal bat,

151
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,139
a subtle difference was detected.

152
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:32,339
The murder weapon seems to be a blunt cylindrical object, though.

153
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,839
Excuse me, Officer Takagi.

154
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,239
I got it.

155
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,239
Good work, Conan.

156
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,639
So, it was that after all.

157
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,339
Yes.

158
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,039
Not only did the shape match,

159
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,839
but the concrete piece found on the head wound of Mr. Tendo

160
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,839
also matched with the piece that was stuck onto the pipe.

161
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,539
Moreover, Mr. Tendo's blood was also detected in the steel pipe.

162
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,539
In other words,

163
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,739
the steel pipe that was at the back entrance

164
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:04,639
was indeed the murder weapon that was used to kill Mr. Tendo.

165
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,639
Then, what with the metal bat?

166
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,939
I know, right?

167
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,339
It's not the murder weapon,

168
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,139
and yet, Mr. Tendo's blood and hair were found on it too.

169
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,339
Just what's going on, Mr. Dodonpa?

170
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,239
Well...

171
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,639
Anyway...

172
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,339
Either way, I killed him!

173
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,939
I killed the president with my very hands.

174
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:35,939
I did it! I'm the killer!

175
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,439
It's finally starting to get very interesting.

176
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:44,139
It looks like he wants to be the killer no matter what.

177
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,339
The killer of a crime he didn't even commit.

178
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,739
Does he know the real killer and is protecting the real killer?

179
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:06,991
Mr. Ueki, Inspector Megure wanted me to ask you.

180
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,991
This morning at about the same time that Mr. Dodonpa came,

181
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:12,791
there should've been someone who went in and out of the condominium.

182
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,491
You mean around 11 am?

183
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,291
I don't recall anyone.

184
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,291
Since it was a holiday, there weren't many people going in and out,

185
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,891
so if there was anyone, I'm sure I would've remembered.

186
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:32,991
I guess Mr. Dodonpa didn't directly see the killer.

187
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,991
The only people who went in and out this morning

188
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,291
are Mr. and Mrs. Mori who went on a trip

189
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,691
and Mr. Tendo who went out to buy his bento.

190
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,091
What time was that?

191
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:49,891
At around what time did Mr. Tendo come to buy his bento?

192
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:02,591
7:58 am.

193
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,591
What about it?

194
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,691
Do you know what kind of bento he warmed up?

195
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,191
Let's see...

196
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,591
Hamburger bento.

197
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,491
Did he pour hot water into the cup noodles?

198
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:19,091
Yes, Mr. Tendo always does that.

199
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,291
Thank you very much.

200
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:29,791
What?

201
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,491
What now?

202
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,291
By the way, Mr. Dodonpa.

203
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,091
Where were you around 9 am?

204
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,391
What's the importance?

205
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,091
Just for reference.

206
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:49,591
Oh, at around 9 am I was at Suda Sensei's atelier.

207
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:51,691
At 9 am. It can't be.

208
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,291
Yes, that's just it.

209
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,991
From the results of the autopsy,

210
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,291
judging from the food that was digested,

211
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:04,091
it was found that Mr. Tendo was killed an hour or so after he ate.

212
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:08,091
He had hamburger bento and cup noodles.

213
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:12,991
He bought both at the convenience store at 7:58 am.

214
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:16,391
And he had the bento heated,

215
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,791
as well as poured hot water into the cup noodles so,

216
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,891
he probably went home and ate it right away, no?

217
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:24,291
Right. At around 8 am,

218
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,791
Mr. Tendo must've eaten the bento and cup noodles.

219
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,391
What? If he was killed an hour after that...

220
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,491
Yes.

221
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:36,991
So Mr. Dodonpa, it wasn't after 11 am as you said,

222
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:40,491
but the actual time Mr. Tendo was killed,

223
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:45,391
was at around 9 am, two hours before that.

224
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,591
But, at that time, Mr. Dodonpa you were...

225
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:52,291
Who is this Suda Sensei that you said you visited?

226
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:58,291
Oh, well. We can easily find out by checking, you know.

227
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:07,991
She's an artist that lives near my home In Akebono City.

228
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,091
Officer Takagi join Officer Chiba and head over, will you?

229
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:12,291
Yes, sir!

230
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,291
I guess you weren't needed, Pops.

231
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,991
"Atelier"

232
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,291
Ms. Suda, are you in?

233
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,991
Yes.

234
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:38,291
-"Izumi Suda (68)" -Who's asking?

235
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,891
Are you still resting?

236
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,791
We're sorry to intrude on you.

237
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,891
I got to know him about six months ago,

238
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,691
but I didn't know him at all

239
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:50,591
even if he introduced himself as an entertainer.

240
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:55,491
Because you see, I don't have a TV, radio or cell phone

241
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,791
I don't live in the real, you see.

242
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:06,291
We want to know if Mr. Dodonpa came to see you this morning.

243
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,391
Yes, he came.

244
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,191
He brought back the drawing collection

245
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:14,691
that I lent him for him to think up new material for his performance.

246
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:19,391
He called me last night that he'd be coming here at 9 am.

247
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,791
And he did so.

248
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,091
Are you sure it was at 9 am?

249
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,291
Yes, because I looked at that clock,

250
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,091
so I'm sure.

251
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,291
I brought back the drawing collection that you lent me.

252
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,291
And, this is the cake that you like, Ms. Suda.

253
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,891
Huh? Did I come at the wrong time?

254
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,791
What?

255
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,891
No, you're right on time.

256
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,091
Come on in.

257
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:49,091
Yes, Mr. Dodonpa came here at 9 am sharp.

258
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:56,191
Impossible. He couldn't have killed Mr. Tendo.

259
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:59,891
That's right, because that clock was working okay,

260
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:03,291
and it takes more than an hour from there to get to the crime scene.

261
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,991
His alibi is established.

262
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,691
I wanted to be the killer.

263
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:22,291
Does that mean you know who the real killer is

264
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:26,891
and want to protect him and take his place?

265
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:30,791
Oh, no. That's not it.

266
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,891
Just what do you mean?

267
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,491
The thing I wanted to protect was...

268
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:41,791
I wanted to protect Mr. Tendo's reputation.

269
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,891
Reputation?

270
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,891
Mr. Tendo, helped me get through.

271
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,391
He was priceless and I owed my life to him.

272
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:51,691
But, he there was another part to him!

273
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,291
Well, think over well,

274
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,091
what would be most beneficial for you.

275
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:07,291
It seemed that he knew the weak spots of the people in show biz,

276
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,791
and was blackmailing them with it.

277
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,091
Blackmailing?

278
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:17,891
When I went to the office a little after 11 am today,

279
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,991
I found Mr. Tendo lying on the floor.

280
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,191
He was already dead.

281
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,891
Maybe somebody that he was blackmailing killed him to shut him up.

282
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:29,091
I can't think of any other reason.

283
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:33,791
That's why I couldn't directly report the incident to the police.

284
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,691
If the police searched for the killer,

285
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:40,391
Mr. Tendo's corrupt evil side would be exposed.

286
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:43,291
I just didn't want that to happen.

287
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,191
That's why I decided to say that I killed him because of our differences

288
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,891
in thinking when it came to performance.

289
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:54,191
I could tell that he died after being struck on the head.

290
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:57,691
But since the murder weapon wasn't there,

291
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,791
I decided to make the bat that happened by putting my prints on it,

292
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,291
to be there the murder weapon.

293
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,691
Then, I turned myself in at the police box in front of the train station.

294
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,791
I'm very sorry

295
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,391
for causing you trouble.

296
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,791
What kind of thing and who was Mr. Tendo blackmailing?

297
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,791
About that...

298
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,591
I have no idea.

299
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:28,691
I understand that you did it, out of your consideration for Mr. Tendo,

300
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,291
but, it's not okay to touch the crime scene, right?

301
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,391
Yes,

302
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:34,891
that's a crime.

303
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,491
Exactly.

304
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,591
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:45,691
But investigation of the murder case is top priority for now.

306
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,991
As for your actions,

307
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:51,991
we'll pursue deeper into that after this case is solved.

308
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,891
You may go home for today.

309
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:54,891
What?

310
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,591
But...

311
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,391
I understand how you feel,

312
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,891
so be sure to leave your contact number with us.

313
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,191
I'm sorry

314
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,991
for the trouble I caused you.

315
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,391
Okay, let's start over.

316
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:26,591
I wonder who the real killer that killed Mr. Hideki Tendo is?

317
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,891
As he was saying,

318
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,291
the first ones to emerge as suspects

319
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,091
would be the ones who were being blackmailed.

320
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:36,191
Right, do everything you can to get to them.

321
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,291
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

322
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,791
I didn't have the chance to display

323
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,891
the talents of a great detective after all.

324
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:49,291
I wonder why the real killer took that steel pipe

325
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,791
that was the actual murder weapon away from the crime scene?

326
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,791
Maybe the killer's fingerprints were left on it or something.

327
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,891
But, then wouldn't he have taken it home?

328
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:02,291
It was left by the store room by the back entrance.

329
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:08,391
Well... that's why it was immediately found by the condominium manager.

330
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,891
The killer didn't want to leave it behind at the crime scene

331
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,191
but leave it at the back entrance of the condominium instead.

332
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:17,691
Moreover, it was out in the open.

333
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,091
Were they waiting here all this time?

334
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,891
Mr. Dodonpa's surrounded.

335
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:35,191
I'm sorry, everyone.

336
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:41,091
I, Rokusuke Dodonpa, in order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

337
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:44,091
wanted to take the place of the killer.

338
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,391
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

339
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:50,691
I am really sorry.

340
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:56,291
Everyone throughout Japan understands how you feel, Mr. Dodonpa.

341
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,291
I appreciate you saying so.

342
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,491
Please deliver this to the head office.

343
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:09,491
How did you all find out that Mr. Dodonpa turned himself in?

344
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,991
We were informed.

345
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:16,891
We each received an anonymous call at our company.

346
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,491
Who'd leak out such information?

347
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,691
The ones who knew were...

348
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:28,391
I killed the president there.

349
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,191
What?

350
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:34,091
It's unthinkable that police officer would leak the info.

351
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,091
It's neither Pops nor me.

352
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:38,291
Then, the only one left would be...

353
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,391
Maybe his real motive

354
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:48,591
wasn't becoming the killer of a case that he didn't even commit

355
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,091
but to make everyone think he did.

356
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:58,891
Besides, around 9 am when Mr. Tendo was killed.

357
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:03,091
He visited a person called Ms. Suda

358
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:08,791
after promising the night before that he'd visit her at 9 am.

359
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:14,691
The exact time that Mr. Tendo was killed is 9 am.

360
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:18,391
It fits in too well to be a coincidence.

361
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,791
Pops was concerned about the steel pipe, the murder weapon but...

362
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,391
On the way back from Beika Station there was a construction site,

363
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,691
and it seems to have been brought from there.

364
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,991
Did the killer contact you?

365
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:01,691
I was hoping to pick up clues on the killer.

366
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,991
At this rate, Mr. Tendo wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

367
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,291
