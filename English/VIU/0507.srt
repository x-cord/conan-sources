1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,643
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:03,843
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,843
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,343
The karaoke shop that everyone goes to.

5
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:09,443
What is the truth that doesn't show on the video?

6
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,843
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:12,543
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,343
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,908
Good morning!

10
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:26,108
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop (Part 1)"

11
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,008
Look at this guy, talk about stupid!

12
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,708
What a laugh!

13
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,908
He's just like you, Genta!

14
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:42,908
The shelf over on the other side.

15
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:44,408
You're looking for a mystery book, right?

16
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,108
Yeah, thanks.

17
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,308
Here it is, here it is! Kaori Shinmei's new mystery stories.

18
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,008
"Neck Experiment at Night".

19
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:01,008
There's only one more left. Lucky!

20
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:06,308
Eisuke Hondo?

21
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:09,908
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

22
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,108
Oh, it's you, Conan!

23
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,608
Oh, the brats!

24
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,108
So, are you guys reading comic books without buying them

25
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:19,808
on your way home from school?

26
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,508
Yeah, they are.

27
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:25,808
Didn't you guys come to read comic books, too?

28
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,808
Wrong,

29
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:32,808
we came to buy reference books for the upcoming test!

30
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,408
They rushed over here to buy reference books

31
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,608
because the test date is drawing near.

32
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,308
Like borrowed plumes I guess.

33
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:40,308
He hit the bull's eye.

34
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:43,208
He sure knows difficult phrases.

35
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,908
Eisuke, you've come back to school.

36
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:50,008
I heard that you were absent for a long time.

37
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:53,308
-Yes. -Right! He's starting school from today.

38
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:56,008
You were recuperating from an illness all this time, right?

39
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:59,308
Right, right. To cure love sickness.

40
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,708
No, not love sickness, but just regular illness!

41
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,108
Good grief.

42
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,508
So he's the much rumoured about Eisuke Hondo?

43
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:07,608
Yeah.

44
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:11,008
He's a high school student who came in pursuit of Rena Mizunashi,

45
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,908
the announcer that resembles his older sister.

46
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,608
But, Rena Mizunashi turns out to be his real older sister,

47
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,408
as well as a CIA agent who snuck into...

48
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:24,208
Right. The Black Organization,

49
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,208
the guys who shrunk my body.

50
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,208
Since he found out about his older sister,

51
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,008
it seems that the FBI is sheltering him.

52
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,808
But judging from the fact that he's walking around freely,

53
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,808
he must've refused the witness protection program.

54
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:42,208
"Neck Experiment at Night 1" -This is volume one of the book!

55
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,508
I've got to have both volume 1 and volume 2, so I'll let you have this.

56
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:55,308
But, volume 2 of this book will be coming out next month.

57
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,108
I can't wait that long.

58
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:00,208
I hate to be tied down by anything.

59
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,008
And that includes time, too.

60
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:09,908
Isn't this the reference book that the teacher recommended?

61
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,908
And, it's super cheap too!

62
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,008
You should buy it too, Eisuke!

63
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:17,908
Maybe problems in this book will come out in the next exam.

64
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,008
You guys go ahead and buy it.

65
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,808
I don't think I'll be needing it.

66
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:26,908
That's right. Eisuke, you've already got good grades.

67
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,808
Smart aleck! I'm not going to show it to you,

68
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:32,408
even if you come crying to me begging to see it!

69
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:40,308
See you, Conan, Ai!

70
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,508
See you tomorrow!

71
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,308
Don't forget to do your homework!

72
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:45,408
Same to you!

73
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,008
50 meters behind you.

74
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:53,708
Behind the vending machine in front of the convenience store.

75
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,808
We're being followed.

76
00:05:56,808 --> 00:06:00,808
Yeah, ever since we left the bookstore a while ago.

77
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,808
I still don't know who they are,

78
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,908
but I'm sure that they aren't from the Black Organization.

79
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,908
Yes, I agree.

80
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:11,408
They would never tail anyone so conspicuously.

81
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:15,408
If so, under these circumstances, they're most likely

82
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,908
FBI agents who're watching Eisuke Hondo.

83
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:23,908
True. If they're watching him as well as guarding him,

84
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:26,608
the distance they're maintaining is understandable.

85
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,208
Well, if we want to return to our normal lifestyle,

86
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,108
we've got to crush them quick,

87
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,508
that crow organization.

88
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:40,408
Oh, that's right! Since Eisuke's finally made it back to school,

89
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,708
let's celebrate.

90
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,308
Oh, great idea! Let's do it!

91
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,908
No need to celebrate.

92
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:51,208
Oh, what is it? You mean you can't accept our well wishes celebration?

93
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,908
-That's not it. -Well, wishes celebration.

94
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:57,508
Then, shall we go to the cake shop that opened in front of the station?

95
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,208
Oh, but I don't really care for sweets.

96
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,808
Okay, then let's go to the hamburger shop on 4-chome.

97
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:04,908
Let's go.

98
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:08,008
I hear that their spicy hot chicken is really good.

99
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,708
Oh, but I don't take too well with food that's too spicy hot either.

100
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,808
You sure are finicky, aren't you?

101
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,908
Then, there's only one place left to go.

102
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:20,708
A place where we can all live it up together.

103
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,108
"Tears of yesterday, summer breeze sways."

104
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:30,108
"Pulling the summer that has gone away"

105
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,808
"I'm dreaming a dream with no continuation."

106
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,508
Karaoke?

107
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:38,708
I know that Haibara is not coming.

108
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,708
"Karaoke."

109
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,408
You mean the high school students

110
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:47,808
who went in just now along with the child?

111
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:52,408
Yeah, please inform me when they're ready to leave.

112
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:57,408
When I came last time, I forgot something in that room.

113
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:01,208
But, there haven't been any forgotten items recently.

114
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,108
It seems that my friends hid it,

115
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,608
so it can't be found that easily.

116
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:09,608
Well, I'll be waiting while singing in another room,

117
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,508
so let me know. Okay?

118
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:15,408
"And, you will go off somewhere, too."

119
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:19,608
"You walk off and go on your way."

120
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,508
"Dreaming a dream with no continuation."

121
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:29,608
"When you awaken, time goes by again."

122
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:34,108
Conan, that was good!

123
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:37,108
He's as tone-deaf as ever.

124
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,508
Where's Eisuke?

125
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:43,208
He said he had to go to the men's room a while ago.

126
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,308
Oh, talk about the devil.

127
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:48,808
Oh, boy. The next song is the one you entered...

128
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,808
What?

129
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:52,908
What is it?

130
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,808
Isn't...

131
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:57,008
Oh, I see. This is room number 3.

132
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,308
I came to the wrong room.

133
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,708
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,108
It hurts.

135
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:09,608
Are you all right?

136
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:12,108
I'm sorry! I was in a rush, you see.

137
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,308
Be careful.

138
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,108
That klutz sure is taking his time.

139
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:25,208
-Just for one? -Yes.

140
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,008
Coming to karaoke alone after fishing.

141
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,708
Unusual.

142
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,608
It's the second time he's gone to the restroom.

143
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,308
What the hell is the star of the celebration doing anyway?

144
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,308
Maybe he's not feeling all that well.

145
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,208
After all he was sick up to now.

146
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,008
I guess so.

147
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,308
He's back!

148
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,808
Are you all right? You look super pale.

149
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,308
I'm just fine, yes.

150
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:00,508
If you're not feeling well, shall we head home already?

151
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,108
Yes, we'd better get out of here quick.

152
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:05,708
No! Let's go home!

153
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,208
-Hello? -It's 5 minutes to ending time,

154
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,008
-but would you like to extend? -What? Is it time already?

155
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,408
Oh, we're leaving.

156
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,708
All right.

157
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,808
I mean you were looking at what time it was on your cell just a while ago.

158
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,408
Conan, make sure not forget anything.

159
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:26,408
Okay.

160
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:29,908
Well, the only thing I have on me is my school bag.

161
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
What happened?

162
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,008
My goodness.

163
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,608
Is this for real?

164
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,508
Call the police and ambulance.

165
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:53,108
Right away!

166
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,908
What was that voice all about?

167
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,908
Is anything wrong?

168
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:06,408
Hello, police?

169
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,308
The police?

170
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,908
No good, he's not breathing anymore.

171
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,508
He probably died during the last 30 minutes.

172
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,408
Yes. The Karaoke shop in 3-chome!

173
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:25,308
A customer is lying on the ground and...

174
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:28,408
This room is around the corner up ahead.

175
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:31,608
It's located at a blind spot from the cashier.

176
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,308
Up ahead around the corner

177
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:37,008
are the men's room and a cigarette vending machine.

178
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,308
Come to think of it, he went to the men's room.

179
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,208
It's him after all.

180
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,208
He's the man that was tailing us a while ago.

181
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,108
If this man really is a FBI agent...

182
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,408
I hate to be tied down by anything.

183
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:03,408
Don't tell me that...

184
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:07,408
I don't think I'll need it.

185
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,808
I hope not...

186
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:21,708
Don't tell me that it's him...

187
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,634
According to the driver's license that the victim had on him,

188
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:45,634
he is Mr. Tatsumi Moniwa, age 46.

189
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,834
Officer Tome.

190
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:51,834
He's been hit on the head repeatedly with a blunt object.

191
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,634
He's been beaten to death.

192
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:56,934
Which means that the suit top...

193
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:01,534
The killer probably put it over him to avoid being splattered with blood.

194
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,334
The other things that were left at the scene are...

195
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,234
Inspector!

196
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:10,034
This was found in the chest pocket of the victim's suit top.

197
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:14,334
This is a compact camera.

198
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:15,934
What on earth did he take pictures of?

199
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:19,434
We've got to develop the film to find out.

200
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,934
Officer Chiba!

201
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,134
Yes, sir!

202
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:27,734
Develop this film immediately, will you.

203
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,234
I got it.

204
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,634
You're the one who is in charge of the reception desk

205
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:37,034
at this karaoke box. And you discovered the body, right?

206
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,234
Yes.

207
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,834
Did the victim have someone else with him when he came here?

208
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,734
No. He came alone

209
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,734
but he made a queer request at that time.

210
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,734
A queer request?

211
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,934
He asked me to let him know

212
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,134
when the high school students with the child are ready to leave.

213
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,934
-What? -What?

214
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,634
When Ran and the others leave the room?

215
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,234
Why did he ask that?

216
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:04,534
He said he forgot something

217
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:07,034
in the room that they were using when he came here,

218
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,934
so that he wanted to search the room after they left.

219
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,734
What was the thing he forgot?

220
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:16,234
I don't know. When I came to let him know that they were leaving,

221
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,634
I found him like this.

222
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,734
No, he wasn't looking for something he forgot.

223
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:24,034
He was planning on tailing us again

224
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,534
once we left the karaoke shop

225
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:30,234
like he was doing before we came here.

226
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:34,834
The reason he could've been tailing us

227
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:38,434
was to watch and protect a certain person.

228
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:42,334
Right. If this man is a FBI agent,

229
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:45,334
and if his mission was to do so...

230
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,834
The most suspicious person

231
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:52,634
would be the person this man was suspected to have been tailing.

232
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:55,734
And that's Eisuke Hondo.

233
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:58,334
He doesn't like being tied down.

234
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,234
More than anything, he's been acting strange

235
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,234
since coming back from the men's room.

236
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,234
Well, it's also thinkable that he witnessed something

237
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,834
involved with the incident too, but...

238
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,234
And after the victim went into this room,

239
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:16,834
how many customers left this shop?

240
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,834
I don't think anyone did.

241
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,034
There were several customers that came, though.

242
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:25,634
First, those high school students with the child came

243
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,534
and went into room number 3.

244
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:30,134
Right after them, the customer who died came

245
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:32,134
and went into room number 5.

246
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:35,134
And after that, if I remember correctly...

247
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,934
Dark coloured man entered room number 4.

248
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,934
A customer with a long face went into room number 2.

249
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,434
And an elderly customer

250
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,534
went into room number 1, in that order, I think.

251
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:50,134
Which means that the killer daringly stayed here

252
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:53,434
even after committing the murder?

253
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,534
-What? -Don't tell me that you guys...

254
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,634
Are you suspecting us?

255
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,734
Oh, no. Well, pardon me.

256
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,534
But, just in case,

257
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,534
can you all please give me your names?

258
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:07,934
"Kyota Honma (32), Customer Room 2" -Oh, I'm Kyota Honma.

259
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,734
"Konji Arimoto (34), Customer Room 4" -My name's Konji Arimoto.

260
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:16,034
"Kunio Tamai (63), Customer Room 1" -I'm Kunio Tamai.

261
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:21,034
In other words, to sum it up this is what happened.

262
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,834
Please wait!

263
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:30,234
You mentioned a dark coloured customer just a while ago, didn't you?

264
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:34,934
Yes. And that customer had someone with him.

265
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,034
Yes, I am.

266
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:42,134
But, that person lying down on the sofa in my room right now.

267
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,634
Hey, hey, don't get up yet!

268
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,334
Yeah, sorry.

269
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,434
His voice is hoarse.

270
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:58,634
Yeah, it's been trashed from singing too much while having a cold,

271
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,334
so now the hoarse voice.

272
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,934
But, this one was in this room all this time,

273
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,634
so this one has nothing to do with the incident.

274
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,834
But, he's got to have something to prove it.

275
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,634
Proof?

276
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,634
Are you all right, Eisuke?

277
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:14,334
You look pale again.

278
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,734
I'm fine.

279
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:20,334
Hey, don't tell me that you're the one who did it?

280
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:23,234
I didn't do it, I just saw!

281
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,834
Saw what?

282
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:27,034
When I came back from the men's room the second time,

283
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,834
I went into the wrong room.

284
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,634
I went into the room of that dark-skinned man.

285
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,634
Then...

286
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:37,734
Then what happened?

287
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:42,034
He and that person was...

288
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,734
was kissing!

289
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,034
-What? -What?

290
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,734
I guess that was too much stimulation for a kid.

291
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:54,434
Well, no. I don't think the issue is that he was a kid...

292
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:56,934
You mean kissing in a karaoke shop is not allowed?

293
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,034
No, that's not what I mean.

294
00:17:58,034 --> 00:17:59,834
It'd be no big deal if you're a normal couple.

295
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:03,334
But, I think it's natural that he'd be surprised to see two men doing so.

296
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:07,634
-What did you said? -I understand.

297
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,234
How rude!

298
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,434
I'm a woman!

299
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,934
-What? -What?

300
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,534
A woman?

301
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,434
Oh, I see.

302
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,234
Oh, my apologies.

303
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:28,934
Well, she body builds too,

304
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:31,534
so it's no surprise you made a mistake.

305
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,834
Oh, so that's what it was...

306
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:38,834
But, I'm glad. You were acting strange,

307
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,934
so I was worried.

308
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:45,734
I'm really glad.

309
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:49,634
Yes, I'm glad.

310
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:53,034
It's not that all suspicion on you has cleared yet.

311
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,434
Would you like to take a look at the images

312
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,734
on the surveillance camera of the reception desk?

313
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:00,234
The room of the person who died isn't monitored,

314
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:04,634
but you can see who left their room and when they leave.

315
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,834
Someone's come out.

316
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,834
First, it's Mr. Honma of room 2.

317
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,834
You disappeared after going into the direction

318
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,834
of the victim's room.

319
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,334
I went to the men's room!

320
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:26,634
You saw it, didn't you? That the men's room is in that direction.

321
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,134
Next, it's Eisuke.

322
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,734
I also went to the men's room.

323
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:36,334
Mr. Honma just came out of the men's room.

324
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:38,534
Yes, right. I am.

325
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:41,234
Oh, he's back.

326
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:46,934
After that it was Mr. Arimoto from room number 4.

327
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:50,734
Yeah, I went to the restroom too.

328
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:54,034
Next is Mr. Tamai of room number 1.

329
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,934
Did you also go to the restroom?

330
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,634
No, I went to buy some cigarettes,

331
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,534
but the brand I wanted was sold out,

332
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,034
and I couldn't decide what other brand to get,

333
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,334
so I returned without buying anything.

334
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:08,634
It's true he came back in about two minutes.

335
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:12,034
Oh, Mr. Arimoto's back, too.

336
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,534
Eisuke hasn't come back yet.

337
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:16,234
Right.

338
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,434
Let's fast forward the monitor a little.

339
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:25,034
Oh, he's come back.

340
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,034
Just as he said,

341
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,534
it seems he made a mistake and went into room number 4.

342
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:38,934
Yes.

343
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:42,034
After Eisuke returns to room number 3,

344
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,234
you're also on the camera.

345
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,634
I told you just a while ago, didn't I?

346
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:47,834
That I went to tell the man who died

347
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:51,234
that the high school students were leaving.

348
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,034
But it could also be that you made everyone think so

349
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,534
and actually went to kill him.

350
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,534
I don't think so!

351
00:20:56,534 --> 00:21:00,734
I heard that person scream and went right away,

352
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,134
but the blood of the person

353
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:03,734
who was lying on the ground was practically dried.

354
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:06,134
Really?

355
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,634
What he said is true.

356
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:11,934
Conan comes dashing out of the room in less than a minute

357
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,734
after the staff heads for the victim's room.

358
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,234
Which means, the suspects are.

359
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,434
Eisuke and all you three.

360
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:28,134
Okay, everyone, we're going to question each of you one by one,

361
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,634
so please wait in front of your rooms.

362
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,734
We want to look for something, too.

363
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:36,134
Look for something?

364
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,234
The murder weapon.

365
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,334
The blunt object that was used

366
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:44,634
to kill Mr. Moniwa is nowhere in sight.

367
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:48,534
Right. The suspects are the four people who's entering

368
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:52,034
and leaving each of their rooms are recorded by the surveillance camera.

369
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,634
Mr. Tamai in room number 1,

370
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,134
Mr. Honma in room number 2,

371
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,634
Mr. Arimoto in room number 4,

372
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,734
and...

373
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,034
Eisuke.

374
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:09,434
The victim was killed by being beaten on the head with a blunt object.

375
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:12,834
But no such thing was found at the scene of the crime.

376
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,834
Did the killer have the murder weapon?

377
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,234
It's a fact that Mr. Moniwa was tailing us.

378
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:24,134
If he was a FBI agent who was watching and guarding Eisuke,

379
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,234
did Eisuke who didn't like it...

380
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:32,434
No, is he really a FBI agent to begin with?

381
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,334
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Moniwa?

382
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:06,334
"Next Episode" -Hey, what's this?

383
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:08,734
It's the picture of us! Gross.

384
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:11,234
The murder weapons nowhere in sight.

385
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:16,334
I'm sure it's somewhere in this karaoke shop.

386
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:20,034
Isn't that boy wearing the round glasses the culprit?

387
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:21,234
No.

388
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:24,234
I know the murder weapon is here.

389
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:25,334
What?

390
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:28,134
Sonoko! Your usual "thing" has come!

391
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,634
Next Conan,

392
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,534
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop (Part 2)"

393
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,434
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,834
"Shoes of the Suspects."

395
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,534
That hint is just like Cinderella.

396
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:57,434
Just like Cinderella.

397
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:58,634
Yeah.
