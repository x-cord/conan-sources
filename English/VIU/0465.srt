1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,625
Throwing beans!

2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:05,025
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:06,325
The Black Organization and a boy.

4
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:07,725
A reunion that seems coincidental

5
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:09,225
crosses with a stormy incident!

6
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,525
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:12,025
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:14,125
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,891
Eisuke Hondo tells Pops about a strange part-time job.

10
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:01,791
It's work involving collecting trash from the trash dump in Toriya Town

11
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,591
and to exchange that trash on the following trash day.

12
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,491
We headed for the site just out of curiosity.

13
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,091
However, when we get there, we encountered a homicide case.

14
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,091
We met a boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's accident.

15
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,091
No doubt about it.

16
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:20,591
Which means...

17
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:23,891
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

18
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,491
Finally, it's getting interesting.

19
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:35,591
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Pearl Shooting Star"

20
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,091
Well? What kind of accident was it?

21
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,291
Well, you see...

22
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,791
The person riding the motorbike

23
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,191
suddenly came falling from the sky.

24
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,091
And that person's helmet came off, so I looked at the face.

25
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,691
You're talking about the Masked Yaiba program that was on the other day!

26
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,491
Masked Yaiba?

27
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,791
Yes. It's a scene from the Masked Yaiba program.

28
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,891
These guys were attacking him while he was riding his motorbike.

29
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:08,591
His mask comes off and Masked Yaiba's identity was about to be disclosed.

30
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,691
You're wrong!

31
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,691
No! I really...

32
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,791
Huh? Have we met before?

33
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,291
Huh?

34
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,191
No, I don't think so.

35
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:22,591
Then, what this boy is saying is...

36
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,891
Yeah.

37
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,491
From the shock of losing his mother,

38
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:30,991
he's probably confusing reality with something he saw in a movie or on TV.

39
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,291
Besides, if they wanted to shut him up,

40
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,191
they would've killed him, too.

41
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,291
The woman who died used to jog in the morning four times a week

42
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,891
after she went out to throw out the trash.

43
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,191
If they were going to shoot,

44
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,391
they would've done so.

45
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,591
They wouldn't do something as dangerous as to take the risk

46
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,591
of sneaking into the woman's room and wait for her to come home, right?

47
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,791
True.

48
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,691
Why don't we go to that room, then?

49
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,291
-Huh? -Huh?

50
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,291
You may come up with something, Pops.

51
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,991
Inspector.

52
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,291
What is it?

53
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,791
May I wait here?

54
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,391
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,691
Has he been using the wheelchair for long?

56
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:23,391
No, he's been using it from a month ago.

57
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,991
He went fishing with the people from his company

58
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:30,091
and broke his leg after sliding in a rocky area.

59
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:34,391
The doctor said that his cast will be removed in six months.

60
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:37,491
Which means his room is on the first floor?

61
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:40,991
No. It's upstairs on the second floor next to Mrs. Funemoto's room.

62
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,991
When Mr. Funemoto goes upstairs,

63
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,591
I lend him my shoulder,

64
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:47,991
then I bring his wheelchair up to him later.

65
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,691
This is Mrs. Funemoto's room.

66
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,691
This is the veranda

67
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:06,691
where Mrs. Funemoto was found shot in the head?

68
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,791
But how did the culprit make it into this room?

69
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,391
By the railing,

70
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,791
there is a rope with a hook attached to it.

71
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,991
The culprit probably used it to climb up onto the veranda,

72
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:19,091
broke the window and snuck in.

73
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:24,191
This room is facing the river bank, so not too many people would notice.

74
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,391
But isn't it strange?

75
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:30,191
This door, although the glass near the bottom lock is broken,

76
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:33,091
the glass at the top isn't.

77
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,791
Opening only the bottom lock won't open the door, will it?

78
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,291
That part bothered us, too.

79
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,191
Stop running around, Conan.

80
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,991
Maybe it's because Mrs. Funemoto liked the stars during the night,

81
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,891
she used to frequently come out to the veranda

82
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,191
and gaze at the stars.

83
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,891
So she may have forgotten to lock the door.

84
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,491
Mrs. Funemoto was shot the night before last night,

85
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,791
around 9:00 pm or 10:00 pm.

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:02,191
She just came back from a home party held by one of her friends, right?

87
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,291
Yes.

88
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,991
She came home and said she was going to her room to sleep.

89
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:11,491
Which means the culprit snuck into this room before she entered

90
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,791
and was hiding somewhere in this room.

91
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,691
When Mrs. Funemoto stepped out to the veranda like always, he shot her.

92
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:25,891
He fled after stealing the pearl necklace and bracelet she was wearing.

93
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:30,691
So the culprit is a professional after all.

94
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,591
But it seems the culprit was in a bit of haste.

95
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,191
The culprit left the rope with the hook attached to it below the veranda

96
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:41,191
as well as a rifle equipped with a silencer behind.

97
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:44,191
Well, I guess even a professional makes mistakes.

98
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:46,191
But talk about a super klutz!

99
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:50,691
Look. There is a pearl earring up here that's been left behind.

100
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:54,091
It has a lot of jewellery around it and looks super expensive.

101
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:56,291
I wonder why the culprit didn't take it?

102
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,491
You idiot.

103
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:01,391
It's a pearl, so she probably wore it to the party

104
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:04,091
and she took it off right after coming in.

105
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,291
The culprit who was hiding probably didn't notice it.

106
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,091
Mrs. Funemoto was wearing that earring that day.

107
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,491
But it's strange. Why is there only one?

108
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,291
The other side was on the ear of the victim, right?

109
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,191
Yeah. She had it on her right ear.

110
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,891
I thought the culprit didn't notice it

111
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,291
because he was hiding against the wall of the veranda.

112
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,691
If so, Mrs. Funemoto was a really scatterbrained person.

113
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:31,891
What?

114
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:35,091
I mean, she went out to the veranda after taking only one earring off.

115
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,591
That doesn't seem normal, does it?

116
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,891
Well, I guess it can't be helped if someone called her out to the veranda

117
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,191
when she was taking off her earrings though.

118
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,191
Pardon me, but where were you two days ago, between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm?

119
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:53,991
Me?

120
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,391
I was together with my friends in the living room.

121
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,391
Did your friends also saw Mrs. Funemoto?

122
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,391
Yes, once after she came back.

123
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:06,591
She came into the living room to say she's going to bed.

124
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,091
Where was the boy then?

125
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,691
I think he was already asleep in bed.

126
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,691
He was running around all over the house since sundown.

127
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:19,991
I cleaned up the mess he made and went to bed around midnight.

128
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:23,391
Then, where was Mr. Funemoto at that time?

129
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,491
He also went to sleep, as did his son.

130
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:29,491
He had dinner and went to bed before Mrs. Funemoto came home.

131
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:33,291
His room was next to his wife's room, right?

132
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,491
Yes.

133
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:39,891
He said he was tired since he has been keeping his son company all day.

134
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,791
Inspector.

135
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,191
Does that mean the husband is the culprit?

136
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,191
That's impossible.

137
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,491
I already told you, didn't I?

138
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,191
Judging from the angle of the bullet entry point

139
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,291
that pierced through the back of her head to her forehead,

140
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,091
the culprit must be someone taller than 180 centimetres.

141
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,491
Mr. Funemoto is approximately 160 centimetres.

142
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:05,491
Moreover, someone who's sitting in a wheelchair couldn't have done it.

143
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,391
But what if his broken bone is actually already healed

144
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:11,691
and he stood up on his wheelchair

145
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,991
and fired the gun?

146
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,591
I thought so too and asked the doctor about it,

147
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:18,291
but the day before the incident, he took an X-Ray of his leg

148
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,391
and the bone was still not healed.

149
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,791
The doctor said he probably still cannot stand up on his own.

150
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:27,291
Maybe he had her kneel over so he could shoot her from above?

151
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,191
No way.

152
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:33,191
If so, there should be bullet hole somewhere in the room, right?

153
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:38,791
But there are no such hole anywhere in this room or this house.

154
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,691
Is that so?

155
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:43,391
We also looked for the pearl necklace and bracelet,

156
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:45,391
but couldn't find them anywhere.

157
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,991
Maybe they are in the trash?

158
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:49,791
-In the trash? -I see.

159
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,491
It could have something to do with the case Eisuke discovered.

160
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,591
A case?

161
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:55,791
What is it?

162
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,791
There's a guy who's doing part-time work collecting trash from this area.

163
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,691
It's for a group researching how to make trash harmless.

164
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,291
It seems that he's been working from about two weeks ago,

165
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:11,291
but there's no sign that this group checked the trash that was collected.

166
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,591
I see.

167
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,291
In other words, the husband killed his wife,

168
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,891
and in order to make it look like a robbery,

169
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,591
he threw the necklace and bracelet away as trash.

170
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,391
He then asked someone to collect it for him.

171
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:24,991
That can't be.

172
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,091
Unfortunately, that's not possible either.

173
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,091
Of course we have checked inside the trash cans,

174
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,991
as well as inside the trash bags,

175
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,391
but nothing was found.

176
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,491
I see.

177
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:37,591
How much was the necklace and bracelet worth?

178
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:40,491
I heard that it cost about one million yen for both.

179
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:44,091
Mr. Funemoto bought them for his wife on her birthday.

180
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,691
Her name is carved on the clasp.

181
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,791
Hey.

182
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,991
Takami.

183
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:52,091
Please turn the temperature of the air conditioner up!

184
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:53,091
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,391
Can't he use the remote controller?

186
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,391
Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines.

187
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:01,891
Thank you.

188
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,091
No problem.

189
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:06,891
The officers are still here.

190
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,091
Did you come up with a clue on the culprit?

191
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,991
No, not yet.

192
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,591
Daddy, I'm hungry.

193
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,091
It's this late already.

194
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,091
Shall we order a take-out again?

195
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:21,091
Hey, hey. It's about time for us to eat some of your homemade cooking.

196
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,091
Okay, I'll go make something right away.

197
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:26,491
What's that?

198
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:28,591
There's something here.

199
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:30,691
Onion?

200
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,191
What can I make with what we have here?

201
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:36,691
If it's okay with you, I can help you.

202
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,291
There seems to be a lot of unwashed dishes.

203
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,991
After what happened to Mrs. Funemoto, I just can't seem to do anything.

204
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:44,591
Would you please?

205
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:45,591
Yes.

206
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,391
The expiration date for these eggs is February 4th.

207
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,791
That's yesterday, so I don't think you should use them.

208
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:57,591
Wait a second. If February 4th was yesterday,

209
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,691
the night before would be...

210
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,191
The 3rd.

211
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,091
Wait, Ran!

212
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,991
Hey, what did you make for dinner the day before yesterday?

213
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,691
Huh? The day before yesterday?

214
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,591
Well...

215
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:15,391
Yellowtail teriyaki, boiled vegetables, miso soup and tofu.

216
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:16,491
I think that was it.

217
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,991
That sounds delicious.

218
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:27,036
Takami, where's our meal?

219
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,336
Oh, well...

220
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,236
We have to go shopping first.

221
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:33,536
Hurry up, then. I'm starving.

222
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,636
Okay.

223
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:37,636
I guess we'll get going too, and then come back again.

224
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,736
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,436
Then, I...

226
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,936
I'm...

227
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,536
You don't need me anymore?

228
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:45,736
Yes.

229
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,036
Please wait.

230
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:51,036
Don't you think this incident is related to the part-time job I mentioned?

231
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,836
Like I said...

232
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:56,736
But why not check a little more? You may find some connection.

233
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,136
Gosh...

234
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:13,436
What's going on?

235
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,236
I just realized something now.

236
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:20,236
I figured out the culprit's trick on how to make the jewellery disappear.

237
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,436
It's the blind spot that we failed to notice.

238
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,036
Make it disappear?

239
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,336
Don't tell me they were flushed down the toilet?

240
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:30,636
We checked the sewers too, but we didn't find anything.

241
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:34,036
Well, we'll talk about the details after the meal.

242
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,136
If possible, we'd like you to cook for us, Ms. Shigeno.

243
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,136
Yes, right away.

244
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:39,536
No, the ones who are going shopping

245
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,036
are Ran...

246
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,636
and Eisuke.

247
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:45,936
We'll ask Mr. Funemoto's son, Toji, to go as well.

248
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:48,436
Is that okay with you, Mr. Funemoto?

249
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,536
Yes, sure.

250
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:53,136
Hey.

251
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,236
Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,836
I don't understand what you're talking about or trying to do at all!

253
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:03,836
Well, it's nothing unusual for him to change his views drastically.

254
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:07,336
He's still too young to know the truth.

255
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:12,936
Imagine him knowing his mother was killed by his own father,

256
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,936
Mr. Tatsuhito Funemoto.

257
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:21,336
I thought its better if we don't tell your son just yet.

258
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,536
It seems certain that Mr. Funemoto was in his room

259
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,836
next to his wife's room at the time of the murder.

260
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,536
But he is only 160 centimetres tall and in a wheelchair.

261
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,336
He can't go anywhere to hide the jewellery.

262
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:38,036
Just one pearl earring was left behind on the desk, wasn't it?

263
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,936
Yeah. Conan said earlier

264
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,836
that maybe she was taking off her earring

265
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,436
when somebody called her out to the veranda.

266
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,736
Inspector, doesn't it bother you?

267
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,536
About how Mrs. Funemoto was called?

268
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,236
What distracted her that she would forget to take off her other earring

269
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,536
and go to the veranda?

270
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,836
Don't you want to know what those words were?

271
00:14:57,836 --> 00:14:58,836
Words?

272
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:02,036
I presume this is what Mr. Funemoto told his wife.

273
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,236
It's a shooting star.

274
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,636
Look, right above.

275
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,236
Shooting star?

276
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:11,536
Above?

277
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,736
I see!

278
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,736
A shooting star disappears right away,

279
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,236
so she hurried off to the veranda to see it.

280
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:18,636
It's because she liked stars so much.

281
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,736
Then what does "above" means?

282
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,036
If he made his wife look upwards,

283
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:23,936
he would shoot from a low position sitting in his wheelchair.

284
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,236
The bullet would enter from the top part of the back of the head

285
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:29,336
and pierced through the forehead.

286
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:33,936
It would give an illusion as if someone who was tall had shot her.

287
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:36,736
That way, the gun would be faced upwards.

288
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,536
No bullet hole would be left in the room,

289
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:40,636
because the bullets would go towards the river bank.

290
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,536
What about the window glass?

291
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:43,836
Since he's in a wheelchair,

292
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,436
he couldn't reach the window glass above.

293
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,136
So he couldn't crack it.

294
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,536
Then what about the pearl?

295
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,236
Let's say he killed his wife in the second floor room.

296
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:55,736
He couldn't have dispose of it outside, right?

297
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:59,136
Mr. Funemoto's leg is broken.

298
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:02,836
Did you really check the house thoroughly?

299
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,736
Yeah, we checked every place they could be.

300
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:09,836
How about inside the vacuum cleaner?

301
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,436
Vacuum cleaner?

302
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,336
We actually didn't look there.

303
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,836
But Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines

304
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:18,236
and if he were to use it, it would make a loud noise.

305
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:19,936
Besides, a person in a wheelchair

306
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,336
couldn't possibly take out a vacuum cleaner with nobody noticing.

307
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:26,336
It's true that if Mr. Funemoto used the vacuum cleaner,

308
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,436
someone would notice.

309
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:30,436
If Ms. Shigeno did, it's another story, right?

310
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:31,436
Huh?

311
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:36,436
Please recall what those three did the day the murder was committed.

312
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:39,536
Toji was running around the first floor from sundown.

313
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:43,036
Ms. Shigeno was cleaning up after Toji.

314
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,236
What about it?

315
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,636
It's only natural that children run around and mess the place up.

316
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:49,136
There's nothing's strange about it, right?

317
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:53,036
Yes, but what if it was February 3rd?

318
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:55,036
February...

319
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,436
3rd?

320
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:58,536
February 3rd is...

321
00:16:58,536 --> 00:16:59,736
You mean...

322
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:04,036
Right. That day, an old custom handed down for generations is held.

323
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,036
It's Setsubun, right?

324
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,136
Conan?

325
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,136
Setsubun?

326
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:12,036
I'm sure that Toji had his father wear an ogre's mask

327
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,836
and was throwing beans saying,

328
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:17,036
"Devils out! Good luck in!"

329
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,236
And Ms. Shigeno later got rid of everything.

330
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:21,736
Hey! Don't tell me that...

331
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,336
He took the pearls apart, mix them with the beans

332
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,936
and had her suck it up with the vacuum cleaner?

333
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:28,936
The size and shape are similar. Moreover, there were a lot of them.

334
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,936
If she began vacuuming after 11:00 pm,

335
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,036
she must've wanted to finish as soon as possible.

336
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,236
She wouldn't have noticed the pearls among the beans

337
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:38,736
and probably sucked everything up together.

338
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,036
So this is how the crime was carried out.

339
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:48,736
From sundown, Mr. Funemoto went throwing beans around the house with Toji.

340
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:52,036
After his wife came back, he went to her room saying he wanted to talk.

341
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:55,136
He shot her on the veranda the way I mentioned a while ago.

342
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,336
He hooked a rope with a hook on it to the veranda railing

343
00:17:57,336 --> 00:18:00,636
and cracked the glass to make it look a break-in.

344
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:05,636
Then he broke the pearl necklace and bracelet apart.

345
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:08,136
He threw them down from the second floor railing

346
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:11,136
towards the carpet on the first floor and scattered them.

347
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:14,036
All that's left to do is for Ms Shigeno

348
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:16,336
to suck them up with the vacuum cleaner.

349
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,636
Check the vacuum cleaner.

350
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,336
Yes, sir.

351
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:22,536
If Mr. Funemoto threw the vacuum cleaner bag out as burnable trash,

352
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:26,036
he didn't have to leave the house at all to get everything out of his way.

353
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:28,736
Yes, after making the part-timer collect this,

354
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,436
he would tell him that the work is over.

355
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,936
After his leg has healed, he will take the pearls out of the trash.

356
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,736
He will put them back together again, hire another part-timer

357
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:38,036
and make him take it to the pawn shop or something.

358
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:41,136
Since Mr. Funemoto's wife's name is on the clasp,

359
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:45,836
it would look like a burglar or someone really did steal them.

360
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,336
But where's the proof?

361
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,536
You don't have proof, do you?

362
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,436
Fingerprints.

363
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,336
Was Mr. Funemoto's fingerprints found on the pearls?

364
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:55,836
They're married so I'm sure he has touched them eventually.

365
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,036
No, not the pearls.

366
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,736
Mr. Funemoto used something to keep from getting gun powder traces on him.

367
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:06,436
He pulled the trigger through the lace curtains.

368
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:11,436
I figured out what it was when I saw the onion on the wheelchair.

369
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:12,436
Onion?

370
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:17,036
The onion being there means that it was on his finger.

371
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:19,536
He didn't realize that something he wore on his hand

372
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:22,536
had onion on it.

373
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,936
Yes, the kitchen rubber glove.

374
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:29,636
Mr. Funemoto used the rubber gloves in the kitchen that he had hidden

375
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,136
to kill his wife.

376
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,236
The following day, you returned it secretly to the kitchen after breakfast.

377
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:37,936
Then you made Ms. Shigeno go check on your wife.

378
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:40,236
Inspector, we found the pearls in the vacuum cleaner!

379
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:43,136
Get the forensic officer and check the kitchen rubber gloves!

380
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,136
Yes, sir!

381
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:47,136
What Mr. Funemoto didn't expect was that, after the incident,

382
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,136
Ms. Shigeno stopped cooking.

383
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:54,336
That's why you asked her to make something a while ago, didn't you?

384
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:57,936
You wanted Ms. Shigeno to put on the rubber gloves to wash the dishes.

385
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:02,836
Your fingerprints would be mixed with hers on the inside of the gloves.

386
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,636
You wanted the gun powder traces on the gloves to wash off

387
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,736
so that nothing would be detected.

388
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:08,936
Mr. Funemoto.

389
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:12,036
Please tell me if I'm wrong in any way.

390
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,336
Mr. Funemoto, please say...

391
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,936
Please say it's all a lie!

392
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,436
Did you know?

393
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,436
That she was addicted to partying?

394
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,236
For the past six months,

395
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:28,036
I had to stay home because of my injury.

396
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,436
I didn't notice at all

397
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,536
that my wife had accumulated expenses

398
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:34,236
in order to hold parties once a week

399
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,336
and was in great debt.

400
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,636
I didn't think she would go that far.

401
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,636
Money! Money! I don't have money!

402
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,036
That's right. I'll use this house as collateral and borrow money.

403
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,036
Hey, you...

404
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,736
I'll divorce you if you want.

405
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:54,236
It seems that you no longer make me shine.

406
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:57,936
I've got plenty of other sponsors to go to.

407
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:58,936
Hey.

408
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,036
I'm not going to take care of Toji either.

409
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:03,236
I'm sick and tired of raising a child already.

410
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:07,236
Divorced with a child doesn't suit a star like me, does it?

411
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,936
I just couldn't forgive her for what she said,

412
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,936
despite being a wife and mother.

413
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:15,236
I'm home!

414
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,336
Daddy!

415
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,736
What's the matter?

416
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,936
Are you crying?

417
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:22,736
If so, let's throw beans again and cheer up!

418
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:25,536
I'm sure that will make mommy in heaven happy.

419
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,436
I guess so, Toji.

420
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,436
I'm going to leave you and go out for a while.

421
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:38,936
Because I'm an ogre that took away a precious person from you.

422
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,536
He went home?

423
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:11,536
After showering Toji with questions,

424
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,636
he suddenly said he had something to do.

425
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,936
Showering him with questions?

426
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,236
He asked about the accident Toji saw

427
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,136
and about the foreign lady who questioned him.

428
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,936
Toji said that when he asked the lady who she was,

429
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:25,136
-the lady seems to have answered "Uma-uma" in English. -Uma-uma?

430
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,236
I wonder what it means.

431
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:27,236
Uma...

432
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,936
Uma-uma?

433
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:35,136
A secret makes a woman a woman.

434
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,536
Vermouth?

435
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,236
Hondo.

436
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,336
It's the name of that guy.

437
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,736
You mean the one that Kir killed?

438
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:44,936
Yeah.

439
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,436
His friend kept calling out to him,

440
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:50,736
as if chanting, despite him not being able to hear a thing.

441
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:53,636
Hondo...

442
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:55,036
Like so.

Darn it!

446
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,736
Wait, Genta!

447
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,236
I'm sure there's a cliff over that side!

448
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:12,136
There!

449
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:13,136
It's a person.

450
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:15,036
A person is floating in the lake.

451
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:19,036
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.
