1
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:08,494
"I pledge to clean up Japan once and for all."

2
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:11,594
So, whose words are these?

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,894
Huh?

4
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:16,194
It sounds awfully familiar but I wonder who it was.

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:18,094
Ryoma Sakamoto!

6
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:24,294
In the 3rd year of Bunkyu, 1863 June 29th,

7
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:26,094
it was written in the letter

8
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,294
that Ryoma sent to his older sister, Otome.

9
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:32,694
Wow. You're so knowledgeable, Conan.

10
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,894
I mean, I saw it on TV.

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,994
But, why would you be quoting Ryoma's words, Sonoko?

12
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,994
The Ryoma Exhibition's being held

13
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:46,794
at Uncle Jirokichi's Suzuki Museum since last week.

14
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:50,794
And, a forewarning of a crime letter was sent there...

15
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,294
by my beloved.

16
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:56,994
Sir Thief Kid, you see!

17
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:02,694
"You see?" You say in the Tosa dialect.

18
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:04,694
Right!

19
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:07,494
I was checking up on Ryoma and got all into it.

20
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:10,494
But I don't think there's anything at the Ryoma Exhibition

21
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:12,994
that Kid would be interested in stealing.

22
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:17,094
He does! The gunbelt that Ryoma is said to have been given

23
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,094
by Shinsaku Takasugi together with the pistol!

24
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:21,194
Gunbelt?

25
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:22,694
Right!

26
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:27,394
It's a gorgeous belt with a large ruby embedded by the buckle!

27
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:29,394
Is it real?

28
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:33,494
There's also a letter that Ryoma wrote regarding the belt.

29
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:37,194
It seems to have been authenticated by a famous appraiser too!

30
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,294
Well, I guess it's genuine

31
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:41,794
because Uncle Jirokichi got it after all!

32
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:45,594
No, it seems he couldn't get hold of it.

33
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,394
The person who wanted to feature that belt

34
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,994
and hold an exhibition

35
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:52,594
wouldn't agree to sell it to him for quite some time.

36
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:54,094
So, Uncle having no other choice, told that person that

37
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,394
if he was going to hold a Ryoma Exhibition, do it here

38
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,294
and agreed to lend him the museum.

39
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,194
But, like... Kid is after it too.

40
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:06,594
Oh, well, it's actually not what it looks to be.

41
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,994
Hey.

42
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:11,894
Like the fog clears.

43
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,994
Lets see through love and crime as well!

44
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,794
A forewarning of crime letter unlike the usual.

45
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:17,694
Thief Kid fights for the treasure!

46
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:19,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:21,594
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:24,194
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,398
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 1)"

50
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:13,698
What? He's coming to return something he stole?

51
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:17,398
You mean it was written in Kid's letter?

52
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,198
Yeah.

53
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:21,998
"There are three things I would like to return"

54
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:24,098
"to the Ryoma Exhibition that is currently being held."

55
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,498
"So, I shall appear in a few days."

56
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,598
"Thief Kid."

57
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,998
Three things?

58
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,798
It seems that this man, Mr. Shishihiko Tarumi

59
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:38,198
held a Ryoma Exhibition some 20 years ago too

60
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:41,198
and things were stolen back then.

61
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,298
On the night before Ryoma was assassinated,

62
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,798
an unfinished letter he wrote to his wife, Oryu.

63
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:51,198
An Omiya goblet with his blood that splattered on it

64
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:52,998
when he was assassinated.

65
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:57,098
And, the Smith & Wesson pistol's first model

66
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:00,398
that he had hidden in his pocket.

67
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,898
But those things were stolen not by Kid,

68
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:05,798
-if I remember correctly... -No.

69
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:10,298
The woman who was rumored to be the 20 faces of the Showa era,

70
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:13,598
the woman thief, Phantom Lady!

71
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:17,398
I don't know what kind of relationship Kid had with Lady

72
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,298
but after stealing the three items,

73
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,198
Lady quit committing crimes

74
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:24,798
and Kid appeared two years after that,

75
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:29,098
so they could've been teacher and student.

76
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,998
And? When is he coming?

77
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,998
I wonder. All it says in the letter is, in the near future.

78
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,498
Then, cancel the Ryoma Exhibition right away

79
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,098
and chase all the people out!

80
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,398
Without a definite date,

81
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:42,498
it's disadvantageous for us who are on guard,

82
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,098
and it may work out exactly as he planned!

83
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:46,098
If he's just going to come and return the goods,

84
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,398
he could easily do so by mingling among the crowd!

85
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,498
But, Mr. Nakamori.

86
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,298
I mean, he's coming all this way just to return the items.

87
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:55,698
Why should we object?

88
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:59,198
Oh, well, but Superintendent...

89
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:01,598
Besides, in order to nab Kid,

90
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,698
we'd first have to invite him in, wouldn't we?

91
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,498
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki who received the letter, was also saying,

92
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:11,498
"The entrance should be wide but the exit narrow."

93
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:14,498
He said that this is the fundamental of catching rats.

94
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,898
"The Great Suzuki Museum" -Uncle!

95
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,098
Long time no see!

96
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:22,298
Oh! I haven't seen you since the iron raccoon incident.

97
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,698
Hello.

98
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:27,098
There's quite a long line of people, isn't there?

99
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,298
Yeah.

100
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:29,798
Well, in addition to the popularity of Ryoma,

101
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,598
the letter was delivered from Kid too, so...

102
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,498
Well, if I were the host,

103
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:39,298
I would've advertised the event using leaflets, and TV commercials

104
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,498
and gather several times more than the people who are here!

105
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,498
But, isn't it unusual?

106
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,498
That you would lend your museum space out to someone

107
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:52,498
other than yourself.

108
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:54,898
I didn't think of doing so, at first,

109
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:58,298
but I just couldn't let an amateur take care of this situation

110
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,498
knowing that Kid would be coming to steal.

111
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,598
An amateur?

112
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,498
Yes, the one who is hosting this Ryoma Exhibition called Tarumi

113
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,898
held exhibitions every time something got popular,

114
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:13,598
be it the Gikyo Exhibition, or the Nobunaga Exhibition,

115
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,898
but because of sloppy security, he's been attacked by thief after thief

116
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:19,198
and something is stolen each time.

117
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,998
Then, you should've bought Ryoma's gunbelt!

118
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:24,898
Did he ask for an exorbitant amount or something?

119
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:28,998
No, on the contrary, I actually got a super discount.

120
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:32,898
He wouldn't let me show it to our appraiser before buying it

121
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:35,698
so I'm not even sure if it's genuine or not.

122
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:39,398
But, it's been appraised already by a famous appraiser, hasn't it?

123
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,898
Well, yes.

124
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:43,598
But, I've got my doubts

125
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,898
about whether we can really fish Kid with it.

126
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,298
But, you did get to fish Kid, didn't you?

127
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:53,898
Though it seems that he was not really after the gunbelt.

128
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:56,098
That gunbelt is genuinely

129
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,998
what was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi!

130
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:02,798
Right? Master Hanamura.

131
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,598
"Masanosuke Hanamura (63), Appraiser" -Indeed.

132
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,598
Judging from the condition of the leather,

133
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,798
it is surely vintage.

134
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:11,798
The ruby on the buckle is splendid too.

135
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:12,898
Moreover, Ryoma himself

136
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:16,598
has drawn an explanatory diagram of that belt too.

137
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,298
It can be none other than genuine.

138
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,598
Masanosuke Hanamura.

139
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,698
He's got a good eye for sure,

140
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,698
but he charges an exorbitant amount for appraisal,

141
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:29,198
and rarely takes on any appraisal work.

142
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:32,098
If you would like to, do you want me to show you girls

143
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:34,798
the real thing with your very eyes?

144
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,898
Although it's still before opening time, I'll show it just to you.

145
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:44,498
Oh, so this is Ryoma's gunbelt!

146
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,898
This really has a kind of existence to it, doesn't it?

147
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:50,998
The picture of the belt is really drawn on the letter.

148
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,498
But I can't read the words.

149
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:57,798
-True. -In the past, men of America

150
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:01,798
used to carry this thing called a gunbelt on their hips.

151
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:04,898
It is the holder for a gun and the bullets to be put away.

152
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:07,098
In other words, it is like the sheath of a sword

153
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,198
wrapped around the hips by a belt.

154
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:13,698
It is a wonder that none of the current New Yorkers

155
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:18,998
are wearing such an interesting thing on them.

156
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:20,498
That's what it says.

157
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:22,498
I guess Ryoma would say something like that!

158
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,298
Yes, true!

159
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,498
Hey.

160
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,398
What's that big jar?

161
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,998
Oh, that's...

162
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:35,298
It's a jar that is said to be something

163
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,798
that Ryoma hid inside when he was a child

164
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:41,598
and got into trouble because he couldn't come out of it.

165
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,598
Other things include

166
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,598
the statue of the Buddha that Roma saw and complimented on

167
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:49,698
and the "kendama" that Ryoma is said to have wanted too.

168
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:51,498
In other words, anything goes...

169
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:54,598
Oh, could this hanging scroll be...

170
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,998
It's a hanging scroll that he impulsively wrote

171
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:59,598
when grieving over the corrupted government.

172
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,598
Just as I thought.

173
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:04,498
Well, but it's doubtful whether that's genuine too.

174
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,298
True.

175
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:09,698
If you will go as far to doubt the judgment of my eyes,

176
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,998
after the Ryoma Exhibition is over,

177
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,898
I'll agree to show it to your appraiser for appraisal then.

178
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,098
Oh! I couldn't ask for better!

179
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,898
That is of course, if the things here are spared

180
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:24,898
from the evil hands of the Magician under the Moonlight.

181
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:28,398
I shall leave the security within the museum to you, then,

182
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:30,398
Advisor Suzuki.

183
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:31,498
Yeah.

184
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,798
They're sure suspicious characters.

185
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:38,698
Say... Maybe he's got all the things exhibited here

186
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:41,598
covered by a high amount of insurance?

187
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:44,298
I thought so too, and checked,

188
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:48,298
but only a measly amount was insured.

189
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,998
The admission fee is cheap too,

190
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:53,698
so if anything is stolen, it would be a great loss.

191
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,498
Then, uncle, just what do you intend to do?

192
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:01,098
Well, you've got some kind of strategy worked out, don't you?

193
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,498
Well, the thing is...

194
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,998
No?

195
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,198
You prepared virtually nothing?

196
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,698
-No. -"No," huh?

197
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,698
If he were going to come here to steal something,

198
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,598
I have to prevent him from doing so.

199
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,098
But there is nothing I can do

200
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:20,098
if he wants to come to return something.

201
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:24,498
All three items are small enough to hide into his pocket.

202
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:28,598
Besides, I had my hands full just trying to make the space for them.

203
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:29,798
"Spaced Reserved for Thief Kid's Returned Treasures"

204
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,298
You mean the assumed location

205
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,898
for where Thief Kid will be returning the treasure.

206
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,198
If only I knew when and what time he's planning to show up,

207
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,398
there is something I could do, but...

208
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,098
Huh? You mean there was nothing about

209
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,798
when he would be coming in the letter?

210
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,898
Right, there was nothing!

211
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:49,898
There hasn't been one time till now when Kid implied

212
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:52,998
or made no mention of the time and date he would be showing up.

213
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,198
Inspector Nakamori...

214
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,198
Don't tell me it's someone else then, trying to copy Kid,

215
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,598
and putting the blame on him?

216
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:04,098
No, that letter is definitely what he had sent.

217
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,098
Maybe he's planning to mail another letter when he has the chance,

218
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,498
indicating the time and date he'll be showing up?

219
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,898
Like, his schedule is too busy now

220
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,498
so he's waiting for a convenient date or something.

221
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,698
If so,

222
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,698
what could he be waiting for?

223
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:43,398
It sure is popular, just as expected.

224
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,798
Yes.

225
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,798
But the most popular is...

226
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,598
the place that Kid is assumed to return the treasure.

227
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:52,798
I'm sure that Ryoma is vexed to tears.

228
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,598
Hey, stop pushing!

229
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,798
Hold it!

230
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:14,598
I see.

231
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:17,298
A sensor is set up to that space only

232
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:21,498
and plain clothes officers are mingled among the crowd.

233
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,298
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,698
I was just playing.

235
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,898
And if a suspicious person should appear,

236
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,798
it's rigged so that the person can be nabbed on the spot.

237
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,098
Advisor!

238
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,898
We've got trouble, advisor!

239
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,398
What's with all the noise?

240
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,498
Just now, this was found in the mailbox of your residence!

241
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,698
This is...

242
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:47,398
A letter from Kid?

243
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,498
What?

244
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,298
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

245
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,798
I will bring the pistol in question

246
00:13:56,798 --> 00:14:00,298
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

247
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,798
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto.

248
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,498
Thief Kid.

249
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:13,798
Kid!

250
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:15,998
Just what does this mean?

251
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:17,598
Cleanse.

252
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,798
Water...

253
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:20,998
Don't tell me!

254
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,398
Rain.

255
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,798
Was this what Kid was waiting for?

256
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,898
I pledge to clean up once and for all.

257
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:49,885
Right now!

258
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:55,449
Take a look at this super long line!

259
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,049
Hearing that Thief Kid informed that

260
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,949
he will be committing the crime at 20:00 tomorrow,

261
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,849
despite it being right before closing time,

262
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,249
Thief Kid's fans are gathering one after the other over

263
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,949
to the Great Suzuki Museum forming a crowd!

264
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,549
Will Thief Kid appear as predicted

265
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:12,149
and be able to return the items that were stolen 20 years ago,

266
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,649
that is, Ryoma Sakamoto's letter, the goblet

267
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,849
and the pistol?

268
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,649
Or, is he planning to steal the gunbelt

269
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,449
in return for the things he will be returning?

270
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,749
And, what is his true intention behind suddenly publically

271
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:25,149
announcing the day he will be committing the crime?

272
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,149
Will everything be made clear tomorrow?

273
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,649
What? Rain?

274
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,449
You mean Kid waited for it to rain

275
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,949
before he decided on the day of his crime to be carried out?

276
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,449
Yes! It looks like it's going to start raining anytime outside now,

277
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:43,149
and tomorrow's weather forecast says it'll rain!

278
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,849
But, how on earth does he intend to use the rain to his advantage?

279
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,649
Is he planning to bust through the ceiling

280
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,749
where the Ryoma Exhibition is being held?

281
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:56,349
No, my staff checked the museum right before opening,

282
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:59,649
but there are no explosives set up at all!

283
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,449
Maybe it's the clothes the people are wearing?

284
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,949
Because when it rains,

285
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,049
there are a lot of people wearing raincoats.

286
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,349
I see!

287
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:13,149
If he's mingled among that crowd, he would be inconspicuous!

288
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,249
Right, right!

289
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,349
It's hard to believe that Kid would've been waiting for rain

290
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:20,049
because of such a dinky reason but...

291
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:22,849
At any rate, I think we should cancel the exhibition tomorrow

292
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,949
and keep people from coming here!

293
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,249
Then, he would end up coming to this exhibition hall

294
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,749
where only we are on guard,

295
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:35,449
all alone in order to return three items in question.

296
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,249
It'll turn into an ideal situation to nab him!

297
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,349
But, up to now he has always under similar situations,

298
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:47,349
disguised himself as you or one of your men,

299
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:50,449
and while putting everyone to sleep using sleeping gas.

300
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,949
Not this time! We will all be wearing gas masks

301
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,449
as well as verify everything using passwords.

302
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,649
If we make sure to strictly follow set procedures, all will be fine!

303
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,749
So long as there aren't any people getting in our way,

304
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,149
we can definitely nab him.

305
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,249
I can't really agree to your plan, though.

306
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,149
I gathered items having to do with Ryoma Sakamoto

307
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:12,149
and am holding this exhibition

308
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:15,049
because I want to introduce them to as many people as possible.

309
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,349
And yet to say, the exhibition should be held off

310
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,949
for an entire day just for one thief,

311
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,649
I really can't agree that's a very good idea.

312
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,349
Oh, but, you see...

313
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,149
Moreover, during the instant teleportation incident,

314
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,849
just because the people were kept from coming inside,

315
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,949
it seems that Kid called off the crime to be committed.

316
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:38,249
He's coming all this way to return the three items

317
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:41,349
that were stolen from me 20 years ago, you know?

318
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:44,649
I really don't want him to call it off.

319
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,849
At any rate, please let the people in as usual tomorrow!

320
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:52,249
Whether you can catch Kid or not

321
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,449
depends on your skill and capability!

322
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:59,149
Besides, I wish you'd guard and protect what you should be protecting.

323
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,349
After Kid returns the three items,

324
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,649
I've heard rumors that he will be coming after

325
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,049
the featured item of the Ryoma Exhibition,

326
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,049
the gunbelt that Ryoma owned, as his reward.

327
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,149
Well, I trust you will do your job.

328
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,549
Police officers!

329
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:18,749
Darn!

330
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:21,749
If they trust us, why don't they cooperate?

331
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,849
But, we've got a problem.

332
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,349
With so many people here,

333
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,649
he'd be able to return the three items fairly easily.

334
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,149
There's one way that he wouldn't be able to do that!

335
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:36,449
Remember? It was also written in his letter that just got here!

336
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,449
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

337
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,049
I will bring the pistol in question

338
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,449
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

339
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:50,149
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto once again.

340
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,549
What about this?

341
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,149
Well, Kid's going to come not to steal something like usual

342
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:56,849
but rather to return things, you know?

343
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,249
Moreover, one of the items is a pistol.

344
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:01,149
If you use a metal detector gate like the one

345
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:05,649
they use at airports and check, it'll be easy to find him!

346
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:08,049
Because the one holding the pistol is Kid!

347
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,449
True.

348
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,649
You're so smart, Conan.

349
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,849
We the police thought about that too,

350
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,649
but were told from the higher ups not to!

351
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:23,749
Why?

352
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,249
If we were to protect something,

353
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,149
we would set things up at the entrance,

354
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,349
but if he sees something set up before coming into the museum,

355
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,949
we figured he'd think twice about returning the items!

356
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:35,849
Then, why not set it up not at the entrance,

357
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:40,749
just before this room with the Ryoma Exhibition?

358
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:43,749
And a lot too, so the people won't stop in place!

359
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,149
Oh, come on.

360
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,649
That's a great idea!

361
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,449
While we're at it, we could set up an X-Ray device

362
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:53,249
that can scan the insides of hand carry bags, then, it'll be perfect!!

363
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,649
Hey, Kid's coming tomorrow, you know?

364
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:59,849
We could never get those things ready by then.

365
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:03,349
Oh, with the power of the Suzuki Financial Group,

366
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,749
that poses no problem!

367
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:07,949
We could nab him at the gate!

368
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:12,449
If anyone is to see the gate and back off in fear,

369
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,949
that would be the Kid!

370
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:18,449
Okay! Start setting up the gates right away!

371
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:22,049
Turn the museum into a large cage trap in half a day

372
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,149
to catch the Kid!

373
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,349
Yes, sir!

374
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:31,049
Just as expected, rich people sure are flashy.

375
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,649
Okay, you guys!

376
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,249
There is a high possibility that

377
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,049
Kid has come in here beforehand with a pistol!

378
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,449
Check every nook and cranny of the museum

379
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,349
-using the metal detector! -Yes, sir!

380
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,949
"The Next Day"

381
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,549
Officers on guard at the entrance of the museum!

382
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,749
How is it going there?

383
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:58,749
Sir!

384
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,849
There's no one who noticed the gate and rushed to leave!

385
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,649
Is the metal detection gate functioning all right?

386
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:09,449
Yes! There is no one in possession of the pistol in question.

387
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,149
What about inside the exhibition room?

388
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:15,649
No one who looks to be Kid has appeared yet.

389
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,449
Is Kid really going to come?

390
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:18,949
Idiot!

391
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:20,949
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

392
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,349
and not shown up!

393
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,949
I'm sorry!

394
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:27,949
Come on, Kid.

395
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:31,649
I'll catch you for sure this time!

396
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,149
Wow, fantastic!

397
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,649
It really looks like the boarding gate of an airport!

398
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:41,049
Moreover, there are three gates in all.

399
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,049
Just as expected of Uncle. He's really something!

400
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,049
Something bothers me after all.

401
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,749
Writing something like,

402
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:55,649
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

403
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,649
I'm sure he would assume something like this would happen, and yet...

404
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,549
In addition, I can't even make out

405
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,349
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

406
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,349
The last sentence of the letter.

407
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,549
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

408
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,749
I don't understand what it means.

409
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:16,449
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

410
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:21,449
Or is he really planning to wash something?

411
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,649
Darn!

412
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,649
What on earth is Thief Kid going to be washing?

413
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:56,949
17cm is about...

414
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,749
This long?

415
00:23:58,749 --> 00:23:59,749
Kid!

416
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:03,549
I came to return the stolen goods this time.

417
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,149
Come on, let's go inside too!

418
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:08,849
I don't think you should!

419
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,649
Because it's for sure that Thief Kid's going to do the washing here!

420
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,349
Thief... Thief Kid!

421
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:17,649
Next Conan,

422
