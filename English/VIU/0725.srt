1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,711
The gem, the Blushed Mermaid that Thief Kid is after

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,911
was supposed to be exhibited on the Bell Tree Express.

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:07,611
Although this was postponed,

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:10,511
it ended up being exhibited in another place.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,511
I came to the Great Suzuki Museum

6
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,611
along with Sonoko, Ran and Sera.

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,111
Like always, Advisor, Jirokichi Suzuki and Inspector Nakamori

8
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,911
had flawless security measures awaiting Kid.

9
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:29,111
However, when the time that Thief Kid warned he would come arrives,

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,811
the carpet is pulled up,

11
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,211
and the instant the gigantic aquarium is blinded from view,

12
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,911
the turtle with the gem attached to it

13
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,411
vanishes in the blink of an eye.

14
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,911
I don't get it.

15
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,511
All sides were surrounded by hard glass,

16
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,611
plus the ceiling and both sides

17
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:50,211
were covered with special alloy.

18
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,711
Just how on earth could he have stolen it

19
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,211
in such a short time

20
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:56,011
when the aquarium was blinded from view with that carpet?

21
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,111
No.

22
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:01,011
The trick of putting the card in the aquarium is easy.

23
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,011
All that needs to be done is to roll the card up

24
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:04,211
and tie it with a string that melts in the water.

25
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:06,311
Then pull the fishing line

26
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,211
that is tied to the string through the card,

27
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:10,411
put a pebble at the tip of the line.

28
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,411
And hang it on to the lighting.

29
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:16,111
Then if it is rigged to fall using a remote controller,

30
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,511
the card that had fallen will go through the wired net,

31
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,011
while the string melts in the water

32
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,211
and the card opens up, displaying the message on the card.

33
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,511
Well, if it were Sera, Sonoko, Pops and Inspector Nakamori,

34
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,511
who were able to get near the aquarium

35
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,711
after they got wrapped up in the carpet?

36
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,511
And if it were somebody among the riot police

37
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,611
that were standing in front of the aquarium to begin with,

38
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:40,011
they would've probably been able to directly put the card inside.

39
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,411
But back then...

40
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,811
the one who made the most suspicious move was...

41
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,311
Ran.

42
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,611
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

43
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,311
are slashed by the light of deduction.

44
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,111
The mystery of the diamond that totally disappears.

45
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,211
Who is the one Thief Kid disguises himself as...

46
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,811
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,711
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,611
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:03:56,898 --> 00:04:02,598
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 2)"

50
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,998
Inspector Nakamori!

51
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,898
Something that looks like a winch

52
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,398
was found from the lighting!

53
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,598
There are traces of thin string-like objects

54
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,598
having been embedded on the ceiling and walls.

55
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,198
I see.

56
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,298
The perp tied the fishing line that was connected to the winch,

57
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,998
passed it through the pillar of the lighting

58
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:22,598
and attached it along the ceiling and walls,

59
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,698
and tied to the carpet.

60
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,898
When those were pulled,

61
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,598
the carpet which had been cut into shape, came up too.

62
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:33,198
And this IC recorder was also found near the winch.

63
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:36,798
Three, two, one.

64
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,698
That's the recording of his voice counting down

65
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,498
just before the turtle disappeared along with the gem.

66
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:41,498
What?

67
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,298
He rigged it so that the fishing line

68
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,598
would be severed in keeping with the voice.

69
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,498
He sure knows what he's doing!

70
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,998
Hey, you...

71
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,598
You seem to be siding with Kid,

72
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,198
but don't tell me that you're...

73
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,698
Oh, no.

74
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:59,498
I'm just a bit amazed at the way he does things.

75
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,198
Hey! Take off your clothes!

76
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:03,798
-Huh? -I'll check you from head to toe.

77
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,698
Give me a break.

78
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:06,898
Inspector Nakamori.

79
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:10,098
Maybe we should give up and get everybody out of here.

80
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,098
Huh?

81
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,798
We drained out the water from the aquarium

82
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,498
and check every nook and cranny yet,

83
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,798
we still can't find anything.

84
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:20,898
It seems that everybody here's already gone through a body check,

85
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:23,898
but neither the gem nor the turtle has been found, right?

86
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,998
Darn! Hey! How is it on that side?

87
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:28,798
We've finished checking this side too!

88
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:30,998
No turtle, no gem!

89
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,398
But, Ran's still not finished...

90
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:35,698
She'll be fine.

91
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,998
Because Ran'll be able tell if it's authentic or not.

92
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,798
Right?

93
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:42,998
Yep.

94
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:47,198
So, it could be that Kid's not around anymore after all.

95
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,498
Yeah, he's really a mysterious person, isn't he?

96
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,798
To disappear along with the gem just like magic.

97
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:54,698
Talking of magic,

98
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:58,498
I saw a magic similar to this on TV the other day.

99
00:05:58,498 --> 00:05:59,498
What...

100
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:02,598
It was on air with the magic

101
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,398
that I performed at noon today.

102
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,098
The coin that the magician brought close to a glass bottle,

103
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,098
went right through the glass

104
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,098
and dropped inside it.

105
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,298
Maybe that magic has something to do

106
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:15,798
with how Thief Kid carried out his magic this time?

107
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,998
Yep! I'll bet!

108
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,198
I think you should tell Inspector Nakamori

109
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,098
of how that magic was performed, no?

110
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:26,098
So you say...

111
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:28,998
You know if I do that, you'll be in a fix and yet.

112
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,398
Right? Sir Kid.

113
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,898
Wrong, I'm...

114
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,098
I won't tell anybody.

115
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,798
I was watching after all, you know.

116
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:42,198
Just before the carpet flipped up,

117
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:45,198
you secretly backed away from us.

118
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:46,198
Huh?

119
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,198
You did that because you knew that

120
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,598
the carpet was going to be pulled up

121
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,698
and you backed off so that you wouldn't be involved, right?

122
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,498
No!

123
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,498
It was because just then you asked me what time it was,

124
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:59,898
so I tried to check it with my cell.

125
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,298
But the moment I opened my cell,

126
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,098
the display went black.

127
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:05,098
Really?

128
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,498
Is that really true, Ran?

129
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,298
Yeah.

130
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:12,798
So, I thought that the wave was weak,

131
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,898
and walked about two or three steps over to the window.

132
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,798
That's when the carpet suddenly...

133
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:19,698
Rather, you were following me from behind back then too,

134
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,498
weren't you Conan?

135
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,298
You had a wondering look on your face.

136
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,598
Conan!

137
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,598
Don't tell me that...

138
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,498
Uncle Jirokichi!

139
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:35,898
Was the clasp of the gold necklace

140
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,598
that was attached to the gem rusty?

141
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,398
Yeah, because it was made of iron.

142
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:43,598
Well, I was thinking of changing it

143
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,598
to a real gold clasp later though.

144
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,598
That is, after the turtle shed and the gem came off.

145
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:51,998
I see.

146
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,598
So, that's the story.

147
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,998
Kid didn't steal the gem.

148
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:58,598
He just made it vanished from everyone's view.

149
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:01,398
He manipulated the hearts of people...

150
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:06,398
With expertise.

151
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:10,098
Moreover, he hasn't realized that he had made a big mistake

152
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:14,098
and is still disguised as that person.

153
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,298
It is past closing time,

154
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,298
those still left in the building,

155
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:24,698
please leave the premises.

156
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,198
Hey, did you hear that?

157
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,298
Huh?

158
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,798
Didn't you hear a strange moaning sound in the toilet?

159
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:32,898
Not really.

160
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,498
Maybe somebody was trying to pass his bowels or something?

161
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,298
Well it seems that Kid has left,

162
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,898
so let's get going too.

163
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:40,998
Yeah.

164
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,698
Go on, get everybody and everything out of here!

165
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:09,398
The aquarium was searched thoroughly,

166
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:12,398
and everyone here went through a body check.

167
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,898
Still no one had it,

168
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:18,798
this means that Thief Kid had taken the turtle

169
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:22,398
with the gem on its back outside this museum.

170
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:23,998
This is an undisputable fact.

171
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,298
There is no further reason

172
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:27,898
for the police to remain here.

173
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:30,298
But, we've got to at least find a clue

174
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:32,798
as to how Kid stole that turtle with the gem attached to it

175
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,298
outside of this aquarium.

176
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:35,798
Come now...

177
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:37,698
It's already past 10pm,

178
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,798
so why don't we call it a day for now,

179
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,198
and start the search again at a later date?

180
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:44,198
Good idea. I'm starved too.

181
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:46,998
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep and...

182
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:50,498
Hey, Conan! We're leaving...

183
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:04,598
Well, I guess Sonoko could serve as detective too.

184
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,898
Sonoko?

185
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,398
Are you okay, Sonoko?

186
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:11,898
I'm fine.

187
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:14,198
I just felt a bit faint

188
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,398
because everyone here is so off the point.

189
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:19,198
Because nobody realizes...

190
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,598
that the turtle that is carrying the Blushed Mermaid

191
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,198
on its back wasn't stolen,

192
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:28,807
but rather, simply just vanished out of your sight.

193
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,651
Vanished from sight?

194
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,051
Yes. As proof of that...

195
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,351
Come on, brat, show it to them.

196
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:37,951
Okay!

197
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,051
Hey, Pops, you've got a lighter, don't you?

198
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,051
Huh?

199
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:44,751
Yeah. It's only a 100 yen lighter, though.

200
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,051
Can you try dropping that lighter

201
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:49,151
from right above here into the aquarium?

202
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:52,151
Huh? I tell you...

203
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,051
What do you expect to get out of doing this?

204
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,451
Huh? It's not coming down.

205
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,551
What's going on?

206
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,051
It's stuck...

207
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,451
Why?

208
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:08,851
Magnet.

209
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,551
Huh...

210
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:11,751
Magnet?

211
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,951
Right. I think that plate's made of strong magnet.

212
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:20,151
That type of 100 yen lighters

213
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:23,751
are surrounded by iron where the igniter is.

214
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,851
But, even if this were to be a magnet,

215
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,651
it doesn't solve the mystery

216
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,651
of how the turtle with the gem disappeared, does it?

217
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,251
Right.

218
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:38,051
That turtle couldn't have attached itself to the magnet.

219
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,551
As for the decoration around the gem,

220
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,651
the necklace was gold,

221
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,651
and gold doesn't stick on to magnet.

222
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:45,951
If it were to stick on in any way,

223
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:48,651
it would only be to the clasp of the necklace.

224
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,251
Oh my, I think there were a lot of gems stones

225
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,551
attached to the belly of the turtle too, though.

226
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,751
Hey... that's diamond.

227
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,051
If they were all synthetic diamonds,

228
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,151
I guess they would all stick.

229
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,551
Huh?

230
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,351
The iron that is inside the solvent that is used

231
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,951
when making synthetic diamonds,

232
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,251
during the process of crystallization,

233
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,651
may be taken in as an inclusion at times.

234
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,551
Huh? Inclusion...

235
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:14,051
You're great, Sonoko!

236
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,551
Well, the turtle is in the water,

237
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:18,151
so it's impossible to fix it in place

238
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,151
only by using magnetic force,

239
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,351
but at that time I think it would've been possible

240
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,351
to at least lure it over to the back side of the plate.

241
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,051
Lure it over?

242
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,551
That would've been enough.

243
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,351
Right, Pops Kogoro?

244
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,151
Huh...

245
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,951
Please tell them what happened to your lighter.

246
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,851
It's not only the magnet.

247
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,751
There's a whole lot of adhesive stuff

248
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,751
on the glass part in back of the plate.

249
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,151
Adhesive stuff?

250
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:46,751
Yeah. If the turtle gets stuck here,

251
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,051
I don't think it'll be able to move.

252
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:51,051
But, how was the turtle put there?

253
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:52,451
Food!

254
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,551
-Food... -Huh?

255
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,651
Right!

256
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,251
If you sprinkle a little iron sand on the food,

257
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:01,351
so that the turtle will stick onto the back of the plate,

258
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,151
the turtle will float up along the glass

259
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,751
from the bottom of the aquarium to eat it,

260
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,851
since turtles have a keen sense of smell.

261
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:11,951
Thus, it'll fall right into the trap that Kid had set up.

262
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,151
The chandelier was probably rigged

263
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,251
to sprinkle the food,

264
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,451
and when the carpet was used to hide the aquarium,

265
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,051
this trick was launched.

266
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,551
The body of the turtle is about ten centimeters.

267
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,151
Which means the size of the plate would be enough

268
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,951
to hide the body of the turtle,

269
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,451
so that it couldn't be viewed from the front.

270
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,851
In other words, he was among the men

271
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:37,951
who assembled the aquarium.

272
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,351
Just as would be expected of the magician under the moonlight.

273
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,651
He's pretty good.

274
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,251
This is no time to be amazed.

275
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,051
Huh? Hold it a second.

276
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:48,751
If the turtle was stuck behind the plate,

277
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,551
why isn't it there now?

278
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,651
We drained the water out and looked all over for it.

279
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,651
Somebody secretly tore it off

280
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:57,151
and is hiding it in his pocket.

281
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,751
Ridiculous!

282
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,851
We body checked everybody here already, you know?

283
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,651
There's just one person

284
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:06,251
that wasn't body checked.

285
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:09,651
Are you talking about me?

286
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,651
Come to think of it,

287
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,751
you seem to have bigger breasts than my daughter.

288
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,051
Ran's breasts are authentic!

289
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:18,051
She isn't hiding anything!

290
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,551
The person who's hiding something is...

291
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,351
the person who before the body check got his cheek pinched

292
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:25,751
confirming that he wasn't Kid in disguise.

293
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,251
You, Uncle Jirokichi.

294
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,051
If it were you, Uncle, who in order to check

295
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,451
if the turtle with the gem really disappeared,

296
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:37,751
had the wire net of the aquarium opened

297
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,951
and got on the ladder to look inside it,

298
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,851
you could've torn off the turtle with the gem

299
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,951
that was stuck to the glass

300
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,551
and hide it into the inner pocket of your top, no?

301
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,551
Your body would've blocked it from view,

302
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,051
so that the people behind couldn't see it.

303
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,851
So, I'm searching you!

304
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,451
There's the turtle!

305
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:13,051
Thank God. It looks okay.

306
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:14,751
Then, are you the Thief Kid?

307
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,551
No! I can explain.

308
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,151
Explain?

309
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,651
Just what do you have to explain?

310
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,751
The reason is Thief Kid's card

311
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,151
that was stuck on the floor at Uncle's feet.

312
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:30,351
I think this is what was written on the card.

313
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,351
It's hard to believe that

314
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:33,351
a turtle covered with synthetic diamonds that stick to magnets

315
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:37,551
is really carrying the genuine Blushed Mermaid on its back.

316
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,451
The name of the turtle comes from the sea God

317
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,651
in Greek mythology, Poseidon.

318
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,651
But if its owner were an Italian actress,

319
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,651
it's most likely that she would've named it

320
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,951
after the sea God Neptune, of Roman mythology.

321
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,451
If you don't want anyone to know

322
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,951
that you bought such a fake turtle with a gem on its back

323
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,751
at such a high price,

324
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:58,451
it's best that you retrieve it secretly.

325
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,351
Is that so?

326
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,151
Yeah, this is that card.

327
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,651
It's more or less as Sonoko has said.

328
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,251
That's why you kept repeatedly telling us

329
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:11,751
to get everything and everybody out.

330
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,551
I felt sorry for the turtle in my pocket.

331
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:17,151
And? Where's Kid?

332
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,551
I wonder.

333
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,851
Everything was rigged to be moved

334
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:22,851
by using a remote controller from a distance.

335
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,451
And, you were probably operating it amidst the crowd

336
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,251
that avalanched to the entrance.

337
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,751
I'm sure that Kid's skipping home tonight

338
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:32,051
looking all smug about it.

339
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,051
But, you're fantastic, Sonoko.

340
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,151
It's been a while since you've been a Deduction Queen.

341
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,351
Well, sort of...

342
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:42,351
I don't remember a thing, though.

343
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,851
Could it be that if I work my right brain too much,

344
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,651
my left brain passes out?

345
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,351
You go on ahead.

346
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:54,151
If you're going to the restroom, I'll go too!

347
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:56,051
But...

348
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:57,451
Don't you think your deduction a while ago,

349
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,151
wasn't sufficient?

350
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,251
Ever if it were possible to hide the body of the turtle

351
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,751
behind the plate using that trick,

352
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:08,551
the long necklace that was attached to the gem

353
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:11,151
would've hung down out of the plate.

354
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:14,751
I think that Kid himself also had a strong magnet.

355
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,751
So, he used the magnet to stick

356
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,251
the claps of the necklace against the glass,

357
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:23,351
spun it right around then let it go.

358
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,451
In this way, I think he stuck it

359
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:27,151
onto the magnet of the plate and hid it.

360
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,651
But when did he do something like that?

361
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,151
When else than the time he hid the aquarium

362
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,751
from everybody's view using the carpet.

363
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:37,251
That's probably also when he stuck the card

364
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,751
at Uncle Jirokichi's feet.

365
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,651
Since the people who were wrapped up

366
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:42,651
in the carpet were in a mess,

367
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,251
even if Kid were to be among them,

368
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,651
or was doing something,

369
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,551
no one would've suspected him, see.

370
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,551
Oh, I see.

371
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,951
As proof of this,

372
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,751
the moment Ran opened her cell phone,

373
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:55,851
didn't it go pitch black?

374
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:57,751
As for the cell phones that fold in half,

375
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,251
there are phones that open and close using magnets.

376
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,051
So, I think that back then,

377
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:05,551
there was someone holding a strong magnet nearby.

378
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,651
That's why I think Ran's phone mistakenly thought that

379
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,651
it was closed after detecting the strong magnet

380
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,851
and the liquid crystal display switched off, no?

381
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,351
But back then the people who were near Ran were...

382
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:22,051
Me, Sonoko and you...

383
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,451
Thief Kid.

384
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,051
Hey, what was that sound?

385
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,551
It came from the men's room next door, didn't it?

386
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:46,251
I wonder if something happened?

387
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,351
Hey...

388
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,151
That was...

389
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:54,651
When did you realize it was me?

390
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:57,051
It was the magnet that I mentioned just a while ago.

391
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,951
When Ran opened her cell phone,

392
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,551
the one closet to her at that time was you.

393
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,951
Back then, you were holding the magnet

394
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,651
in your left hand, weren't you?

395
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:10,951
Well, unless you pinched gramps Jirokichi's cheek to start with,

396
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,251
and proposed that everyone get into groups

397
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,451
and do a body check,

398
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:17,051
this trick wouldn't have worked out.

399
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:18,151
But, thanks to all of that,

400
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:21,751
I was convinced that you were Kid.

401
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,651
Our physique is quite the same, I think, though.

402
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,951
You were surprised when Ran and Sonoko asked you to join them

403
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:30,351
when doing the body check,

404
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,551
and you thinking that you were older than them

405
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:34,751
was because you thought that Sera-san

406
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,051
was a boy from the year above, right?

407
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,251
Since normally they'd call a boy in their own class

408
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,251
with the honorific kun,

409
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:45,051
not Sera-san.

410
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,451
Are you saying...

411
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,151
Don't tell me she's a girl?

412
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,351
Yeah.

413
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:54,451
Well, I owe you one in the Bell Tree Express incident,

414
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,451
and you didn't steal anything this time either,

415
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:57,851
so I guess I'll let you go.

416
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:00,051
I mean, I would.

417
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:02,351
Huh? What do you mean?

418
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:17,351
Why you how dare you use the stun gun on me?

419
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:23,851
Come to think of it, her underwear was really low-rise.

420
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,851
Sera, your underwear...

421
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,051
You're totally exposed!

422
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,051
Darn.

423
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:50,251
Well, at least I got this back.

424
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,551
But, how did you end up being caught

425
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,051
in the men's room?

426
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:57,251
Huh?

427
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:00,351
Well, you see...

428
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,551
What? You went into the men's room

429
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,751
because the ladies room was crowded?

430
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:28,051
No joke?

431
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,551
But, I wanted to do my thing quickly.

432
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,351
I don't look like a girl to begin with anyway.

433
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,951
So I can't blame Kid for making a mistake.

434
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:38,651
That reminds me.

435
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,951
Didn't you say something about that hat?

436
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:42,951
Yeah.

437
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,451
I wanted to ask you

438
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:47,951
if you saw a suspicious man when you picked this up.

439
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,151
Not really.

440
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,951
Is it your favorite?

441
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:55,251
Yeah, my older brother who passed away,

442
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,451
used to wear hats like this all the time.

443
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,051
So, I'm copying him and...

444
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:03,051
But...

445
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,451
as to this hat that you picked up,

446
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,151
it seems that it's molded into the shape

447
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:10,951
that he used to leave behind on hats.

448
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:14,951
Although something like that is never possible.

The perp is a person whose name starts with the character Na.

Please let me help.

455

I want to help in the investigation however I can.

456
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:47,651
Huh? Nana was killed?

457
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:49,051
No problem at all.

458
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:52,051
We've already arrested the perp.
