00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:04,342
"Riichi Tengan (40) Ventriloquist"

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:06,666
was a story about a ventriloquist

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,366
who is possessed by his "partner" doll

4
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:12,667
and driven to kill his wife.

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,366
However, Mr. Tengan

6
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,966
who suffers from dissociative personality disorder,

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,266
also known as multiple personality disorder,

8
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,066
asks Pops to keep watch over him

9
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:26,466
since he may kill his wife.

10
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,966
Pops refused to take on the job,

11
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,266
but the following morning,

12
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,266
his wife was found killed

13
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,667
in a very similar way as the performance.

14
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:40,767
However, Mr. Tengan is soon cleared of suspicion.

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,066
Believing that Mr. Haruomi Togawa,

16
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,866
wanting to settle his illicit affair,

17
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,866
and therefore, committed the crime,

18
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:50,567
the police requests a warrant for his arrest.

19
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,266
However...

20
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:57,566
Would a person who wanted to frame Mr. Tengan for the crime

21
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,367
call Pops and ask for help in the first place?

22
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,166
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

23
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,366
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

24
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,366
The ventriloquist or his partner the doll, who's in charge?

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,666
This is what leads to the essence of the case.

26
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,166
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:15,167
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:02:54,758 --> 00:03:00,658
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 2)"

30
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,657
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

31
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:11,157
I respected the master.

32
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,457
I would never do something like frame my master.

33
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,257
Never ever!

34
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,657
What's this then?

35
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,157
Didn't you use this to make Mr. Tengan

36
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,957
believe that he had multiple personality disorder?

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,357
That... that's mine for sure.

38
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:33,257
I used it to practice ventriloquism.

39
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,957
But, I haven't seen it around for some time.

40
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,157
To think that it was

41
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,657
set up in a place like that...

42
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,357
Then, are you saying that

43
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,257
these glasses splattered with the victim's blood,

44
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,957
and the fact that it was hidden inside your bag,

45
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,957
you know nothing about it, either?

46
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,057
Of course, I know nothing of it.

47
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:53,257
I lost that a little while ago too.

48
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:57,057
I really have no idea why it was in there.

49
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,358
It's true!

50
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,857
Too bad.

51
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,157
I was hoping that it would be for your sake

52
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,457
to admit to the crime you committed

53
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,157
before the arrest warrant arrived, but...

54
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,957
Even so...

55
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,958
What I didn't do, I didn't do!

56
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,557
From Mr. Mouri?

57
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:22,157
Officer Takagi, it's me.

58
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,457
I want to check something just in case.

59
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,358
Dad, you'll catch cold!

60
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,157
Conan?

61
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,757
Where's Mr. Mouri?

62
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,957
He said he had something else to investigate,

63
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,057
so he told me to come and confirm it.

64
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,457
Can you hurry and open it, Officer Takagi?

65
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,558
Yeah, hold it.

66
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,657
I see, this is it!

67
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,458
This is what I was so bothered about it!

68
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,757
Is something wrong, Conan?

69
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,857
This picture is of the living room, right?

70
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,357
Of the crime scene beyond.

71
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:22,857
Yeah, it looks to be so.

72
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,657
What about it?

73
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,457
When the suspect Mr. Togawa

74
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,057
found Mr. Tengan's wife's corpse,

75
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:33,058
he used the spare key to get in too, right?

76
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:38,457
Right, he came as always to pick Mr. Tengan up to go to work,

77
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,657
and rang the doorbell, but since nobody answered

78
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,158
he entered using the spare key.

79
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,957
And he found the corpse in the living room.

80
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,257
He woke Mr. Tengan who was sleeping in the bedroom.

81
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:55,657
Then, he called 110 and Mr. Mouri for help.

82
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,457
That's his version of the story.

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,257
But, he has the spare key.

84
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:04,257
Deep in the night, after Mr. Tengan falls asleep

85
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:06,057
drinking his sleeping pills as usual.

86
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,957
It would've been possible for him to sneak in.

87
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,357
It's also possible that the victim,

88
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,057
his adulterous lover let him in.

89
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:14,957
Then after committing the crime,

90
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,957
we don't know yet whether he stayed at the crime scene

91
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,657
or came back again in the morning but...

92
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:25,257
The murder weapon trophy was here, wasn't it?

93
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:27,357
But, I don't think it was here to begin with.

94
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,358
Oh?

95
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:32,957
See, the traces of dust doesn't match with the trophy.

96
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,257
True.

97
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:38,157
It looks as if the trophy in back was originally here.

98
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:39,457
This...

99
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,258
was here?

100
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,457
It matches perfectly.

101
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,558
That's the way it was in the picture at the entrance too.

102
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,657
Officer Takagi.

103
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,557
I have something I'd like you to confirm.

104
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:55,958
What?

105
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,757
Yes.

106
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:00,857
Yes. Is that so?

107
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,358
I understand.

108
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:07,157
I had them ask the suspect Mr. Haruomi Togawa about it.

109
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:10,457
That trophy is what Mr. Tengan won for the first time

110
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,957
at the long hoped for international tournament.

111
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,357
It seems he always had it in front

112
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,557
because it was so precious to him.

113
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,957
But, it was put behind,

114
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,258
and the trophy that was the murder weapon was placed in front.

115
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:31,957
And as to the place where he called 110 and Mr. Mouri.

116
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,457
As to that phone call.

117
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,458
If I remember correctly,

118
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,657
I think I made the call from the front entrance.

119
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,957
Because I didn't want him to hear me saying that

120
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,958
maybe he killed his wife.

121
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:45,457
A bag.

122
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,458
I don't know.

123
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,257
Because I was panicked too, I don't know where I put it.

124
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,957
I probably left it in the living room

125
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,757
and went to make the phone call.

126
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:59,257
What's this?

127
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:03,357
That's probably thread from the gloves,

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,657
is what I was told by forensics.

129
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:06,957
Gloves?

130
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:11,857
It seems the perp used it to keep his fingerprints off the trophy

131
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,458
that had only Mr. Tengan's prints on it.

132
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,857
Were the gloves found already?

133
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:23,957
No, they weren't found in his residence or any place around.

134
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:28,257
They think he already disposed of them somewhere.

135
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,857
Strange.

136
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,957
Who would hide the glasses on his person

137
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,957
without even cleaning them,

138
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,258
while throwing away just the gloves?

139
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,557
Are we about done already, Conan?

140
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:44,757
I've got to start getting back to headquarters soon.

141
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,357
Did we cover everything Mr. Mouri wanted us to confirm?

142
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,557
Yes. Thank you very much, Officer Takagi.

143
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:53,057
I've got to report this to Pops too.

144
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,358
See you.

145
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,657
I don't get it.

146
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:00,857
The real perp is him.

147
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,157
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:08,858
But, I can't figure out the most important thing yet.

149
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,857
That's from this afternoon.

150
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:21,258
I'm sorry for all the commotion I've caused.

151
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:26,257
I'd like to apologize from the bottom of my heart

152
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,157
for all the trouble and worry

153
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,958
that I caused to all my fans and staff.

154
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:34,557
You don't need to apologize, partner!

155
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,257
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

156
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:39,057
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

157
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:41,857
I see! I got it.

158
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:44,757
I've finally figured out the most important thing.

159
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,357
Pops was...

160
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:50,558
Rather, we were being framed by him.

161
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,957
"The Terrifying and Bloodcurdling Ventriloquist"

162
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,058
"Riichi Tengan's Dark Performance"

163
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:54,608
Thanks for waiting, partner.

164
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,208
You really worked it out well, didn't you, partner?

165
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,008
Let me toast too.

166
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,707
What're you looking for, partner?

167
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,408
Is it that speaker and recorder?

168
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:37,107
You'd never find anything like that around.

169
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:41,208
The police confiscated it long ago.

170
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,507
Shut... shut up!

171
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,507
I'll shut up, partner.

172
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:52,107
If you don't want to talk, I can't talk.

173
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:53,507
Shut up!

174
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,107
You and I are one and the same.

175
00:11:56,108 --> 00:12:00,007
I'm you and you're me.

176
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:02,507
You know that, don't you, partner?

177
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:05,208
Shut up...

178
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,507
It can't be.

179
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,607
Don't tell me that I really...

180
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,507
It can't be!

181
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,608
It's impossible, totally impossible!

182
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,408
Right. It's impossible.

183
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,707
You're completely sane,

184
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,407
and you completely planned out

185
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:29,107
the murder of your wife.

186
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,007
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:34,008
Rather, Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,407
So, you...

189
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:39,807
set up a recorder and speaker somewhere here after all.

190
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,107
Just what're you trying to do?

191
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,607
I killed my wife?

192
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,807
Please quit joking.

193
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,007
I've got to practice from now

194
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:50,407
for my additional performance tomorrow, you see, so I'm busy.

195
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:54,407
Right. I want a reasonable explanation for this, Mr. Mouri.

196
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,107
Because just as you told me to,

197
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,307
I stopped the request for the arrest warrant

198
00:12:58,308 --> 00:12:59,807
for Mr. Togawa for now.

199
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:04,407
I've got to give the court a persuading explanation.

200
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,207
I'm fully aware of that, Inspector.

201
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:12,207
I will now tell you of the truth of the case that I've arrived to.

202
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,007
Isn't Togawa the one who killed my wife?

203
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,807
Didn't he try to frame me by making me believe that

204
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:20,907
I was suffering from multiple personality disorder?

205
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:25,107
So, that indeed was your plan.

206
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,207
You made people initially suspect you,

207
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,007
then made me the great Detective Kogoro Mouri,

208
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,607
clear you of suspicion, which after

209
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,407
you put the blame of committing the murder on Mr. Togawa.

210
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,908
A very clever scheme indeed.

211
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,207
What?

212
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,607
You went as far as to change the program

213
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,607
of your live performance and acted it out

214
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:48,508
in order to mislead me, correct?

215
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,507
Don't tell me that...

216
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,907
So...

217
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,607
Yes, the one who set up the recorder and speaker

218
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:01,107
that was stolen from Mr. Togawa beforehand,

219
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,407
as well as the one who told Mr. Togawa to practice

220
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,007
and he would check on his progress the next day morning,

221
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:09,107
making it impossible for Mr. Togawa to establish an alibi

222
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,108
was Mr. Tengan.

223
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,507
After having said all this, I'd like to go on to explain

224
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,907
how he went on to commit the crime

225
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:20,008
and the circumstances involved.

226
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,807
The murder weapon that killed your wife.

227
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,607
That trophy

228
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,207
was normally placed towards the back of the sideboard.

229
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,208
Therefore, before committing the crime,

230
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,407
the position of the trophy that was precious to you, Mr. Tengan

231
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:34,608
was changed and placed behind.

232
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,507
If Mr. Togawa were the perp,

233
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:41,307
this act would be totally meaningless.

234
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:44,807
Because anything would've served as a murder weapon.

235
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:50,007
Didn't he do so to frame me?

236
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:52,107
I'm sure that's it!

237
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:56,607
Like I already said, he didn't need to do such a thing.

238
00:14:56,608 --> 00:15:01,507
Mr. Tengan, only your prints were found on the trophy.

239
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:05,907
Of course this was done to first make us suspect you.

240
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,707
Therefore, you held the murder weapon trophy with your bare hands.

241
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,207
Moreover, you went as far as to say.

242
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,707
"I killed her."

243
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:17,507
Why would he have to take such bothersome steps?

244
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,707
That... that's...

245
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,207
Then after committing the crime, you wore gloves,

246
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,007
and splattered the victim's blood on Mr. Togawa's glasses

247
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,908
that you also stole beforehand.

248
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:34,807
In the morning, Mr. Togawa woke you up,

249
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,707
and you pretended to find out about her death for the first time.

250
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,607
During the time Mr. Togawa

251
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,907
was calling 110 and me for help on the phone,

252
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:46,107
you put on your gloves again

253
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,607
and put the blood splattered glasses

254
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:51,007
into the bottom of Mr. Togawa's bag and hid them.

255
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:53,807
It was probably then that the thread got hooked onto

256
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:58,407
the connection between the temple and the frame of the glasses.

257
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:01,208
So, that's what it was.

258
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:04,607
Then you feigned suffering from multiple personality disorder

259
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,507
saying that your doll ordered you to do it.

260
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,408
This way, you made everyone suspect you initially.

261
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,507
I killed her.

262
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,907
That guy...

263
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:16,407
That guy inside of me ordered me to do it.

264
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,107
I killed my wife.

265
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,307
Hey. Here I'm trying to establish an alibi for you

266
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:23,707
and you got to make that remark?

267
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:28,308
Then, you made me find this recorder and speaker.

268
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:32,508
This is a speaker?

269
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,507
You made everyone shift their suspicion to Mr. Togawa,

270
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:40,208
and as the final blow, you made the police discover the glasses.

271
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:43,707
This is ridiculous.

272
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,507
Where do you have such evidence?

273
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:50,008
The evidence are the gloves.

274
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,907
The gloves?

275
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:55,607
Yes, the gloves that were thought to be used

276
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:59,107
when put the glasses splattered with blood into Mr. Togawa's bag

277
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,907
that I mentioned a while ago.

278
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:04,907
After that, Mr. Tengan,

279
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,808
you hid those gloves.

280
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,307
The place is...

281
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,307
Yes, judging from the time,

282
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,007
it's in that room no other place than the crime scene,

283
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:16,208
the living room is thinkable.

284
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,807
Then did you find it?

285
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:24,007
No, they weren't found even when the police investigated the site.

286
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,407
That's right, Mr. Mouri.

287
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,007
Most naturally.

288
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:31,007
There's no such thing to begin with.

289
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,907
Then, let's try and ask your partner.

290
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:39,108
You know where he hid them, don't you, partner?

291
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:48,007
Don't worry, partner!

292
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:51,808
I won't dare tell them that I have them with me.

293
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:03,107
Well, that's enough for the joke.

294
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,807
Officer Takagi!

295
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:05,708
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,507
I found them. The gloves.

297
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,607
That stain is...

298
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,307
Blood!

299
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,507
Impossible!

300
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:22,808
I've disposed of them long ago!

301
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:26,207
I would think so.

302
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,308
Of course, those are fake.

303
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,107
Fake?

304
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,607
The real ones were probably disposed of by Mr. Tengan

305
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:36,607
as soon as he was acquitted.

306
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:41,107
But you should've thrown away the doll, too.

307
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,907
However, he's your partner who's been with you for years

308
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:48,307
and even helped you win a international tournament,

309
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:51,607
I guess you never even thought of doing so.

310
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,707
Could it be?

311
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,907
Yes, while you left your partner here a while ago

312
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:01,807
and went to another room to make arrangements with your staff,

313
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,807
we took the liberty of investigating.

314
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,907
The same fiber that was found on the glasses

315
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:10,807
although very slight, was found from inside the doll.

316
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:14,507
The blood of the victim was also found there.

317
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:18,207
Furthermore, the perspiration of another person,

318
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,507
the DNA, was also detected on the fiber.

319
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:24,207
It's probably what was on the gloves.

320
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,907
If necessary, we would like to get a warrant

321
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:31,507
and ask you to provide us with your saliva or hair.

322
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:35,508
Then, we could wait for the test results.

323
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,707
No need for that.

324
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,207
I won at the international tournament

325
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,607
that I've always been hoping for and yet,

326
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,507
to find of all things that my wife and apprentice

327
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,607
had been involved in an illicit affair.

328
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,808
My pride just couldn't forgive them.

329
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,607
Mr. Mouri, how did you figure it out?

330
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:59,408
Of course, the doll told me.

331
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,407
Because you hid your gloves there

332
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:07,208
the facial expression of the doll had changed.

333
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,707
Now everything that's yours is mine.

334
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:19,508
Now, who should I possess next?

335
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,307
You don't need to apologize, partner!

336
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,007
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

337
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:33,507
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

338
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,507
If I were to go on further, the doll...

339
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:37,807
Rather, you and the doll

340
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:41,707
had been telling the truth from the very beginning.

341
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,007
The only one truth.

342
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,607
How can I shut up?

343
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,007
That woman, of all things,

344
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:51,207
is having an affair with your apprentice, you know, partner!

345
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,307
I did it.

346
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:56,507
I killed my wife.

347
00:20:56,508 --> 00:21:02,308
You used the doll to make remarks to act out a perfect crime.

348
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:42,007
What's going on?

349
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:45,708
I remember to the part till when I came here.

350
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,707
Inspector, where is it?

351
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,108
The new evidence?

352
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:02,107
I really did nearly arrest the wrong man this time.

353
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,707
You really helped me out a lot, Mr. Mouri!

354
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,307
Is that right?

355
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:08,608
I helped you out again.

356
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,507
But, I didn't know you had the talent of being a ventriloquist.

357
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,007
-A ventriloquist? -Oops...

358
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:19,707
The voice of the doll a while ago, was you, wasn't it?

359
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,107
Just as you said,

360
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,507
we still have the recorder and speaker in our custody.

361
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,407
Well, I guess so.

362
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:33,707
For me, ventriloquism is like sleep talking.

363
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,708
Well, I guess for you it is, Pops.

364
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,707
First of all, take a look at this picture, will you?

365
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,207
What's this?

366
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,407
A sickle.

367
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:50,407
An animal that has sickles is...

368
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:52,608
-Ka... -Kamaitachi?

369
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,807
Dad?

370
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,007
Heiji? What's up?

371
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,208
Both of you are bleeding.

372
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,808
Hey, that wound.

373
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,208
Don't tell me that...

374
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:11,208
