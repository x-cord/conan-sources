1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,369
We were invited by Sera

2
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,969
to go to solve a series of mysteries related to The Red Woman

3
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:10,969
and came to a rental villa in the remote mountains.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,769
But, a guest at the villa, Hakuya Masaie, is found dead.

5
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,569
Furthermore, Sumika Kawana is slashed with a knife by a mysterious woman.

6
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,969
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

7
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,569
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

8
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,269
Sera's behaviour is a point of concern.

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,469
But the mystery of The Red Woman is finally disclosed.

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,069
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,869
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,269
His name is Detective Conan.

13
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:29,206
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Revenge)"

14
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,606
I've called a car to come to get you for now,

15
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:40,106
so please wait in this living room until it comes.

16
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,706
I'll check the other rooms,

17
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,906
so please guard those five.

18
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,306
Oh, but...

19
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:52,506
What about them?

20
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,806
Right.

21
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,306
I've got something I'd like to ask

22
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,106
this high school girl detective, you see.

23
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,306
As to this boy detective,

24
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,406
Inspector Yamato said a while ago on the phone,

25
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,206
"Take him along on the investigation."

26
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:05,006
Take care of things here, okay?

27
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:10,106
Hey, why isn't Inspector Yamato coming here?

28
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,006
He's on the same team, isn't he?

29
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,606
He said that he had something he wanted to confirm

30
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:18,506
before the press conference announcement tomorrow on The Red Woman

31
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:21,706
and went along with Inspector Morobushi to ask around.

32
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,206
It seems that those two were a bit involved

33
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,806
in The Red Woman case in the past, you see.

34
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,306
It's nowhere.

35
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:36,206
No long-haired wig, no knife,

36
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,806
no wet clothes.

37
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,506
Judging from the fact that

38
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:43,006
there are no wet or muddy spots around the window,

39
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:47,706
it seems that The Red Woman who attacked Sumika is not Tamami.

40
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:51,906
Ninda's room on the second floor was the same when we checked, right?

41
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:55,406
There were no wet places by the front door or in the corridor either.

42
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:56,706
Right.

43
00:03:56,706 --> 00:04:00,706
I thought that either one of the two did it, but...

44
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:03,106
Which means that there's a possibility that

45
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:07,406
Sumika made up the story about being attacked, no?

46
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,706
In order to avoid suspicion,

47
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:11,506
maybe she deliberately slashed herself

48
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,506
to make it look like she was attacked.

49
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,906
I don't think that's possible.

50
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,906
Because the slash on her back

51
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:20,906
was single clean horizontal cut, wasn't it?

52
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,306
She couldn't have done something like that herself.

53
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,806
Then who on earth attacked Sumika?

54
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,706
Maybe

55
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:32,106
the killer isn't inside this villa.

56
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,306
Maybe there's really is something in the forest...

57
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:36,806
Hiding out there.

58
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:39,806
And waiting to come after us.

59
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,506
I was joking. It's a joke.

60
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,906
You're a cop, aren't you?

61
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:52,806
By the way, what did you want to ask me?

62
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,506
Oh, right.

63
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,606
About the strange incidents that happened here

64
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,606
at this villa in the past.

65
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,606
If you were called over here as a detective,

66
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,306
I figured maybe you were told of the details.

67
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,106
You've got the pictures of back then too, don't you?

68
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,206
Yes.

69
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,806
I see.

70
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:16,706
It sure is a strange case.

71
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:22,006
Red apples, red roses and red paint.

72
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,606
At the scene of the crime that occurred this time,

73
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:28,706
tons of tomatoes were floating in the tub, right?

74
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:32,806
They're all things that help bring The Red Woman to mind, aren't they?

75
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:34,006
Huh?

76
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,606
Only this picture looks old.

77
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:37,606
Yes.

78
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:41,406
It seems to have been taken in the afternoon 12 years ago

79
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,606
when their classmate went missing.

80
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,006
See, the one in the middle

81
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:51,406
is Satoko Imoto who found dead by the swamp.

82
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,806
Strange.

83
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:56,406
She's wearing a beige cardigan, right?

84
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:57,506
Yes.

85
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:00,006
When she was found,

86
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,306
I was told that she was wearing a long red coat.

87
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:08,106
The fact is, the knife near the swamp where she drowned,

88
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:14,106
was found three years after the incident by Inspectors Yamato and Morobushi

89
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:17,006
who were still trainees at the police academy.

90
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:21,606
Since then, they've never stopped arguing about the incident.

91
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,106
Inspector Yamato insists that

92
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:27,906
the skeleton that was found together with the girl isn't The Red Woman,

93
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:32,906
but Inspector Morobushi insists that it's most likely is The Red Woman.

94
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:37,306
They found out that the skeleton was The Red Woman after all,

95
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:41,406
so Inspector Morobushi is proud of himself,

96
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:44,206
while Kan's still not convinced at all.

97
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,006
Kan?

98
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,706
Well, I mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato...

99
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,906
I... I call him that because we're childhood friends.

100
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:58,706
And, they went over to the police officer

101
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:03,606
who was at the crime scene 15 years ago

102
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:07,206
who is now retired and works at a Pachinko parlour.

103
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:10,106
Don't you think it's odd?

104
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,206
After the incident you went looking for The Red Woman

105
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,006
and thoroughly checked the forest, didn't you?

106
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:18,306
Why would the murder weapon that couldn't be found then,

107
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,606
just happen to pop up three years later?

108
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:25,806
Maybe it was just hidden under a leaf of a tree or something...

109
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:29,306
It was not in plain sight when we found it either, you see.

110
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,106
But, it's been three years since the incident, you know?

111
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:35,306
Wouldn't the knife normally be more rusted?

112
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:39,006
Because the knife was made of special anti-rust material.

113
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:43,006
Even so, after The Red Woman slashed you,

114
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,006
you ran right after her, didn't you?

115
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,606
You should've known that there was a quicksand swamp

116
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:50,406
in the direction that The Red Woman fled, didn't you?

117
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,306
Why didn't you also search the quicksand swamp back then?

118
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,406
I... I couldn't go after her right away.

119
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:00,106
Because my legs gave out.

120
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,406
What?

121
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:09,906
I mean, that woman threw the knife at me, you know?

122
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,706
Besides, her face was red with splattered blood too!

123
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:14,806
What?

124
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,306
It... It was so traumatic

125
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:21,906
that I quit the police force after that incident.

126
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,306
Hey, in other words...

127
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,706
Yes. It's most likely.

128
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,206
What? Report error?

129
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,006
Yes, that's right.

130
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:34,606
The uniformed police officer, who arrived at the crime scene,

131
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:37,306
was terrified out of his wits and made a mistake.

132
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,906
Well, I'm heading over there with Komei now,

133
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,906
so you be careful, Uehara.

134
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:45,306
Be careful of what?

135
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,206
You idiot, come on! Don't you understand?

136
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,206
She may still be in the forest.

137
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,506
Oh, no. The battery's dead.

138
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:55,406
What did Inspector Yamato say?

139
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:59,206
He mentioned the report that was filled out 15 years ago.

140
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:04,006
Although it said that the officer was slashed by The Red Woman who fled,

141
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:08,606
but the fact was the woman threw the knife at him and fled.

142
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:11,206
I see, so that's the story.

143
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:14,206
If so, just as first deduced.

144
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:17,206
That person's the one who killed Hakuya.

145
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:21,506
As I expected, evil spirits...

146
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,206
-don't exist in this world! -Don't exist in this world!

147
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,863
Good work, ma'am.

148
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:37,963
-And, did you find something? -What?

149
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,663
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -I'm asking if you figured out

150
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,663
who the killer that sunk Hakuya into the bathtub and slashed Sumika is.

151
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,063
No. Not yet.

152
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,863
Just what do you think you're doing?

153
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,763
You're cops, aren't you?

154
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,063
Just as I thought.

155
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:53,663
-"Sumika Kawana (28)" -It's an evil spirit after all.

156
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,563
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is coming after us.

157
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,063
We can't really say yet.

158
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,763
-"Tamami Minegishi (28)" -But, you don't know yet,

159
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:02,663
so she may be right, no?

160
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:07,163
Which means it may be dangerous for us to just stay here like this?

161
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:10,663
One by one, we're all going to...

162
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:14,063
End up like Satoko and Hakuya.

163
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,463
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is going to kill us.

164
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:23,063
I mean it's impossible to run from an evil spirit.

165
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:29,963
Nobody's going to get killed.

166
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,063
The evil spirit of The Red Woman that you're all talking about

167
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:35,363
doesn't exist.

168
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:36,863
But...

169
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:40,363
you don't know who attacked Hakuya and Sumika yet, do you?

170
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:41,363
Not quite.

171
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:47,963
I do know who killed Mr. Hakuya in the bathtub,

172
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,663
But, that's...

173
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:53,463
Isn't it the same person that attacked Sumika?

174
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:56,063
Don't tell me the killer's here with us.

175
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:57,263
Yes.

176
00:10:57,263 --> 00:11:00,763
But, when Ran went to check the temperature of the water,

177
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,563
everything seemed normal.

178
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,463
However, after cleaning, when everybody went to take a bath,

179
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:08,063
tons of tomatoes were found floating in the bathtub.

180
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:12,263
And, Mr. Hakuya's body was found at the bottom of the bathtub.

181
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:15,663
So, the crime must've occurred while the three of you were cleaning up.

182
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:19,263
That means the ones who had the chance to kill Hakuya during that time are

183
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:24,363
Tamami who was in the kitchen making preparations for dinner,

184
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:30,363
and Ninda, who went shopping at a shop located a kilometer away.

185
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:33,863
Didn't you say that it was impossible for the two to commit the crime?

186
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,163
Yes. During that time,

187
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,863
Sumika and the others were cleaning the first floor where the bathtub is.

188
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:41,663
I think it'd been impossible to kill someone back then

189
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:45,163
without Sumika and the others noticing.

190
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,363
So in order to fill the surface of the bath tub with tomatoes

191
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:55,363
and use dumbbells to keep the body at the bottom of the tub,

192
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:58,263
the killer must have taken several trips back and forth.

193
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,463
Then, the three couldn't have committed the crime?

194
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,863
Not quite.

195
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,963
If by the time Ran and the others went to check the water temperature,

196
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:11,063
Hakuya's body was already at the bottom of the bathtub,

197
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,463
there is one person who could've committed the crime.

198
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,563
Right.

199
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:21,763
The person who was cleaning the second floor alone,

200
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:25,363
before the water temperature was checked,

201
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,963
Ms. Sumika Kawana.

202
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:32,563
You could've committed the crime!

203
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:35,063
Sumika killed Hakuya?

204
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,663
Just what're you talking about!

205
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,463
She couldn't have!

206
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,663
Right!

207
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:44,363
Sumika was really cleaning the second floor right through back then!

208
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,063
We heard the sound of the vacuum cleaner

209
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:50,463
as well as the nozzle of the cleaner knocking against the wall too.

210
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,663
As for the knocking sound you heard,

211
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,163
a piece of cardboard was taped onto Ninda's bat

212
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,363
and hanging it from a column, then a rotating fan was pointing at it.

213
00:12:57,363 --> 00:13:03,463
Then each time the wind blows, the bat float up.

214
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:04,563
When it swings back,

215
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:12,563
the bat hits the column making knocking sounds periodically.

216
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:15,163
As proof of that on the tip of the bat,

217
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:18,663
there were traces of something having been stuck on it.

218
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:22,863
Moreover, Ninda's room is right above this living room

219
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:25,263
where Ran and the others were cleaning.

220
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,063
There was a hook on the column of his room

221
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:30,063
where a bat could be hung from too.

222
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:33,663
But, when I went to check the water temperature there was no corpse.

223
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,963
The water was green with bath salt

224
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,963
that the bottom of the tub wasn't visible, right?

225
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,763
That could be,

226
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:42,763
but there wasn't a single tomato afloat.

227
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:44,763
They were just not afloat.

228
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:47,063
In other words,

229
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:50,763
it was just that he tomatoes were not afloat.

230
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,063
Just what do you mean, Conan?

231
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:57,863
This is a tomato that Sera snatched from the crime scene.

232
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:00,363
If you put this tomato into the water...

233
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,663
See, it'll sink.

234
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:07,363
They done this sometimes at the vegetable section of supermarkets, right?

235
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,963
Yes, tomatoes with a large sugar content,

236
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:12,763
unlike regular tomatoes, sink.

237
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:15,763
Maybe that's why you couldn't see the tomatoes

238
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,563
that were at the bottom of the bathtub.

239
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:23,163
Then, how were the tomatoes made to float up?

240
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,663
With salt.

241
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,763
Salt?

242
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,963
Yes. If you insert enough salt beforehand,

243
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:32,163
to barely keep the tomatoes from floating,

244
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,663
all need is to sprinkle salt.

245
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,763
-It floated! -It floated!

246
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:44,063
It floated because by increasing salinity,

247
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:48,463
specific gravity exceeds that of the tomato with high sugar content.

248
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:51,263
Well, I figure bath salt

249
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:54,363
was probably used to avoid suspicion later on.

250
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:59,163
In other words, Sumika pretended to be cleaning the second floor,

251
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:02,763
while she snuck up to Hakuya who was cleaning the bathroom

252
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:08,563
and struck him out cold from behind with the dumbbell.

253
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,463
After drowning him in the bath tub,

254
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:14,363
she placed dumbbells on him and threw a load of tomatoes in the tub

255
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,863
then she put in just enough bath salt to keep the tomatoes from floating,

256
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,663
then covered the tub.

257
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:23,463
She makes Ran and Sonoko go to the check the temperature of the water

258
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:26,963
and make them confirm that nothing is floating in the bathtub.

259
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:30,163
Finally, she goes into the bathroom

260
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,863
and adds bath salt into the bathtub,

261
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:35,063
making the tomatoes float up!

262
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:40,563
As proof of this, when I pulled the body out of the bathtub, like me.

263
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:44,863
There should be a lot on your sleeves too.

264
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:46,563
The traces of something on your sleeves that got wet

265
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:50,663
after soaking into strong salt water then dried,

266
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,363
Salt crystals.

267
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,663
At first, I figure you got it wet

268
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,263
when you first put a lot of bath salt into the water,

269
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,363
but it was so obvious.

270
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:05,463
When we first met, your sleeves were rolled down,

271
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,863
but after the incident your sleeves were rolled up right through.

272
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:14,863
Well, I suspected you from the time we first met though.

273
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:16,663
From the time we first met?

274
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:21,663
Because all the others thought that Sera was a boy

275
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:26,063
but you handed over photos of the incidents without asking her anything.

276
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:30,963
Which means you knew that Sera was a high school girl detective, right?

277
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:34,963
That's why I figured that The Red Woman that we saw in the forest was you

278
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:39,563
and that you'd been listening to our conversation.

279
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:40,763
No joke.

280
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:43,463
You mean that was Sumika?

281
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:46,763
Sumika killed Hakuya.

282
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:48,463
Is it true?

283
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,963
Yes, it is.

284
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:59,163
I wore a red wig, a red raincoat and red boots

285
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:02,063
to act out being The Red Woman.

286
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,863
In order to bring to light the ruthless coward

287
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,963
that left Satoko to die.

288
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,763
Left to die?

289
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:15,263
I found out after hearing from the officer some years ago.

290
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,363
That Satoko's corpse that was found in the swamp was wearing a red coat.

291
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:21,863
Wait.

292
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:23,063
If I remember correctly,

293
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:26,663
wasn't Satoko wearing a beige cardigan back then?

294
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:30,963
Satoko was also disguising herself to be The Red Woman.

295
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:32,863
But back then,

296
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:37,463
wasn't it Satoko who said she saw The Red Woman in the forest?

297
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:38,663
Right.

298
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,763
After saying that,

299
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:42,663
she pretended to get lost when everybody went to search for the woman,

300
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,963
disguise herself as The Red Woman and scare everybody.

301
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:50,263
If so, she should've had an accomplice

302
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:55,763
who guided us to her, who was disguised as The Red Woman.

303
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:58,163
So, it was Hakuya?

304
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,363
Yes. Right.

305
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:04,663
That's why I used apples, rose petals and paint to remind him

306
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:08,163
of The Red Woman to scare him but I wasn't able to expose him.

307
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,363
But once I disguised as The Red Woman,

308
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:13,263
he finally gave himself away.

309
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:16,363
The only one who would mistake The Red Woman for Satoko,

310
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,563
had to be the accomplice who carried out the trick.

311
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:23,963
He was blabbering off in the bathroom back then

312
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:26,563
that when he went to meet Satoko as promised, she wasn't there,

313
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,063
so he got scared and couldn't mention it.

314
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,063
I'm sure that she just got lost in the forest

315
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,063
and couldn't make it to the place they promised to meet but...

316
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:41,763
back then, if he had told us straightforwardly about the prank.

317
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,363
Satoko...

318
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,563
Satoko wouldn't have had to die.

319
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:47,763
Wait a second.

320
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:50,863
Then, who is the woman that attacked you?

321
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,963
Maybe it was Ninda or Tamami who realized the crime I committed.

322
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:59,563
We would never do something like that.

323
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:00,763
He's right.

324
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,863
If... If so...

325
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,863
Then, who on earth?

326
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:07,363
There's one likely person

327
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:10,163
although deeply involved in this incident.

328
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:13,663
No one knows whether she is dead or alive.

329
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,463
I found you.

330
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,763
That's it!

331
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:38,663
There's no Red Woman here.

332
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:43,263
Your revenge ended 15 years ago.

333
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:47,363
Be quick to amend one's wrongs.

334
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:50,763
When a mistake is made be quick at making amends.

335
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:54,063
There's no need for hesitation at all.

336
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,863
We, the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

337
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,763
are planning to reveal the reporting officer's mistake,

338
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:01,363
on the murder case that happened 15 years ago

339
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:04,063
at the press conference tomorrow.

340
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:08,463
So, please bury the hatchet, Shinobu Kagawa.

341
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:13,463
You are also one of the victims of The Red Woman incident after all.

342
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:43,763
A lover?

343
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:48,763
She was the lover of the man who was killed by The Red Woman?

344
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,463
Be it an extramarital affair,

345
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:53,463
but after seeing her beloved brutally murdered before her eyes,

346
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:57,263
the shock and rage probably been drove her to find an opportunity

347
00:21:57,263 --> 00:22:00,663
to get back at The Red Woman for the past 15 years.

348
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:04,063
Then Sumika was attacked by.

349
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:07,363
You just thought it was The Red Woman

350
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,663
because she was wearing red clothes in the forest.

351
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:14,163
It could be that Satoko wasn't at the promised place

352
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:17,663
because she was attacked by her and fled.

353
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:20,763
But, how could you have come up with that?

354
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:25,263
It was because I heard about the mistake on the report 15 years ago.

355
00:22:25,263 --> 00:22:27,363
If the knife was thrown at the victim,

356
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:30,563
there would be no time to pick it up, right?

357
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:34,863
And yet, that knife was found three years later near the swamp,

358
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,263
and the fact that The Red Woman herself

359
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,763
was stuck in the swamp after she fled, so I figured.

360
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:43,863
The killer had to be the lover

361
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,463
who was at the crime scene and witnessed the murder.

362
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:49,663
Hey.

363
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,563
Don't you have to tell your brother about this case?

364
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:58,163
I thought I should, but I lost my cell.

365
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:00,363
Won't you try ringing it with your cell?

366
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:02,763
I think I can find it by the ringtone.

367
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:04,963
Okay.

368
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:12,163
Oh, it's under the dish cabinet.

369
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:14,663
How come it's in a place like this?

370
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:21,463
Who is this?

371
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,563
Thank you for finding it.

372
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:24,963
Oh. Yes.

373
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,163
Brother?

374
00:23:29,163 --> 00:23:30,363
Geez, I really had a tough time.

375
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,163
In order to bring that display up after receiving the call,

376
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,563
you'd have to display the photo and leave it as is.

377
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:40,463
Which means she deliberately showed it to me?

378
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:42,263
For what?

379
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:48,663
I'm telling you, it's true!

380
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:53,063
Dodonpa. Dodonpa doesn't lie.

381
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,063
That's not it?

382
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:57,363
-No, sir. -What's wrong, Inspector?

383
00:23:57,363 --> 00:24:00,663
It's me! I'm the killer!

384
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:06,163
Everyone throughout Japan understands how you feel, Mr. Dodonpa.

385
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,063
Who'd leak out such information?

386
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:11,463
