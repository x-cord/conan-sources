1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:05,056
I, the members of the Detective Squad and Ai, bump into a man

2
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:09,217
who seemed to be pursued by cop-like men in the rain.

3
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:14,697
You brat! Watch it!

4
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:16,087
There he is!

5
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:20,697
Hold it!

6
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,357
The man seems to be a drug dealer,

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,711
and from the pocketbook that he dropped.

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,811
I deduced the date, time and place of the drug deal.

9
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:41,437
In other words, E22 to "ma", Y21 to "tsuki",

10
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:45,157
G11 to "nihon", each symbolizes a Chinese character.

11
00:00:45,277 --> 00:00:46,928
With these clues,

12
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:51,647
you can tell right off that they are subway routes and station numbers!

13
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:52,886
Huh?

14
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:57,644
Since in E22 of Azabu Juban, the 3rd number is circled,

15
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:01,171
so the 3rd kanji character "ju" is chosen.

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,954
Using this rule,

17
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:07,444
if you read up to the 5th line of the code, E22 is "ju"!

18
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:11,172
C10 is Nijubashimae on the Chiyoda Line,

19
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,262
the 1st letter is circled so it's "Ni"!

20
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,867
Y21 is Tsukishima on the Yurakucho Line, so it's "Tsuki"!

21
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:22,217
M09 is Shinjuku Sanchome on the Marunouchi Line, so it's "san"!

22
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,857
G11 is Nihonbashi on the Ginza Line, so it's "hi"!

23
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:29,507
If you line everything up, it comes out "December 3rd"!

24
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:35,057
But there were codes that I couldn't decipher,

25
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:39,357
so Heiji offered to help over the phone.

26
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,887
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:48,085
Codes using subway lines and station numbers.

28
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,029
Interesting!

29
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:54,482
Some of these codes are written to the left

30
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:56,827
and others are written to the right, aren't they?

31
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,827
-Huh? -True, it looks to be so.

32
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:05,837
Then! Maybe one side are the stations in Tokyo and the other in Osaka?

33
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:09,267
If so, the codes that you deciphered,

34
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:12,847
until the 5th line are all written on the left side, so they're all no good.

35
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,886
-That's right! Escalators! -Huh?

36
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,977
When riding escalators,

37
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,477
in Osaka people move to the right and open the left side,

38
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,457
while in Tokyo it's the other way around, right?

39
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,577
That's why the stations written on the right are stations in Osaka

40
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:31,237
and the ones on the left are stations in Tokyo!

41
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,907
Hey, Hattori. Is there a bridge called Ebisu there, too?

42
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:39,967
Hattori?

43
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,487
There is, here in Osaka.

44
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,607
The kanji characters are different,

45
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:52,023
but there's a bridge that people often use to meet each other!

46
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:56,240
Hattori? What's up? Hattori!

47
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:01,070
-You can't hear him? -Maybe something happened?

48
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,317
Don't tell me he got caught trying to get the dealers.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,244
He's so hot-blooded. It's possible.

50
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:13,037
Hey, Hattori? Answer me, Hattori!

51
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,867
-Hattori! -There're three.

52
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm looking around Ebisu Bridge,

53
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:26,679
and I see three people with a rose on, holding it, or waiting for somebody.

54
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:33,887
-There's only 5 minutes to go before noon! -Yeah.

55
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,717
I guess we'll have to narrow down the tart to one by then.

56
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:41,807
Just the two of us!

57
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,407
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

58
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,317
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

59
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,317
Joint deduction using smartphone images.

60
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:52,407
What will Hattori do when he sees Kazuha?

61
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:53,935
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:55,739
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,029
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:42,058
"Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 2)"

65
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:46,488
"Ebisubashi."

66
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:50,205
And? What kind of people are those three?

67
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,798
Two men and one woman.

68
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:55,698
I can show then to you using my smartphone if you like.

69
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:58,988
Even if the drug dealer were to show up,

70
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,588
I'm sure you would be able to recognize him.

71
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,748
Then stay connected

72
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,048
-and send me the images. -Okay!

73
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:11,868
How about it? Can you see it okay?

74
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,328
-Yes! -Yeah!

75
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:17,498
-Perfect. -And, what about the three?

76
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:23,911
The first one is this rugged faced dude!

77
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,088
He looks like bad news.

78
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,231
He looks suspicious. He's keeps checking the time.

79
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,936
His wristwatch looks super expensive, too.

80
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,148
Speaking of checking... See!

81
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:42,046
He's taking something out of his jacket pocket and looking at it.

82
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,288
A cell phone?

83
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:48,908
He's shaking it in front of his face! Maybe it's some kind of signal?

84
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:54,488
Maybe he hasn't slept well. He keeps yawning.

85
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,460
And? I don't see the white roses. In his right hand?

86
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,467
Right!

87
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,223
He's holding it carefully in his right hand. A bouquet of white roses.

88
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,298
Isn't he the bad guy?

89
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:16,061
-I think so, too! -Me, too!

90
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:18,108
What about the other two?

91
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,897
Next, she wearing a white rose decoration

92
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,474
on her hair!

93
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:30,898
-Her hair's fluffy and cute. -Maybe she's a model?

94
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,038
-Maybe she's waiting for her date? -She looks suspicious.

95
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:39,351
-Huh? -Take a good look! That bag that she's holding!

96
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,178
It's the newest model of the Fusae Brand!

97
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,308
It's so expensive, your eyeballs will pop out.

98
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,508
She's wearing a rose corsage, too!

99
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:52,500
It's not sold yet in Japan, you know? I wonder where she got it.

100
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,560
So, that's your concern?

101
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:57,348
Look, she's looking at her shoes.

102
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:01,636
-Did she step on something? -She bent down!

103
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,100
She put something in her shoe.

104
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:11,008
-She looks suspicious. -I agree!

105
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,288
Me, too!

106
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:17,217
And the third one is this fickle looking guy

107
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:20,942
wearing a white rose on his chest!

108
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,798
Hey, he looks like he's talking to somebody.

109
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:29,698
Yeah, to a girl, a girl! He's been talking to some girl.

110
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,498
Kazuha?

111
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,518
What're you doing?

112
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:41,908
Hey, Hattori.

113
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:46,045
That girl looks like Kazuha.

114
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,038
Yeah. It's her. It's Kazuha!

115
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:53,288
She's being picked up by a good-for-nothing guy, that idiot.

116
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:57,288
But, well... I don't think he's the one.

117
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:01,498
No idiot picks up girls before a deal.

118
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:05,748
Could he be one of Kazuha's law enforcement acquaintances?

119
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,918
Idiot! Look close!

120
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:12,078
Bleached hair, with nose pierce, and a tattoo on his neck?

121
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,428
I've never seen such cops! Moron!

122
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,398
True.

123
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,058
Only less than 2 minutes to noon.

124
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,240
-Hattori! No time left! -Don't rush me.

125
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:25,820
Since it's not that fickle one,

126
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:29,678
it's either that man or that woman...

127
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,493
Hey, Hattori! I'll tell you my deduction, okay?

128
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,648
Hattori? Hey, Hattori!

129
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,388
Hattori!

130
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,478
No good. I can't concentrate.

131
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:04,398
Hattori? Hey! Hattori!

132
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:07,398
Are you listening, Hattori?

133
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,898
-Hattori? -Quit hollering!

134
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:14,228
Get on with your deduction!

135
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,408
Okay. As for the first one...

136
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:21,664
The rugged face man that had the white rose bouquet

137
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,899
isn't the one.

138
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:29,088
-What? -He looks the most suspicious from his looks, though.

139
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:32,838
Besides, he took something secretly out of his pocket.

140
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:36,348
He was making queer signals, too!

141
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:40,938
As to that, he was checking his bangs with a hand mirror.

142
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,348
He fixed his bangs holding the mirror

143
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,738
so it looked sort of weird.

144
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,108
Then, what about his yawning?

145
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:54,048
He was just checking his breath.

146
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,718
He was holding the roses behind his back

147
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:01,508
because he wanted to give them to her as a gift and surprise her.

148
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:06,378
I guess you're right. If he were using the white roses as a sign,

149
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:10,168
he would've held them in a more obvious way. So...

150
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,128
this man probably...

151
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,370
Was waiting for his date!

152
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,244
True!

153
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,868
-Wow! -Way to go, Conan's master!

154
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:28,268
Wait a minute. Those deductions were virtually all mine.

155
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,948
What about the brand loving woman

156
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:33,148
who was wearing the white rose on her head?

157
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:36,408
She seemed to be looking at her shoes.

158
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:39,468
She bent down and put something in her shoe, right?

159
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:41,908
Maybe a small weapon or something?

160
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:47,518
No, I think she had a shoe sore, so she took off her shoe for a while.

161
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:49,788
She was putting band aid on her heel, too.

162
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:53,268
Bad people also get shoe sore, right?

163
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:56,745
But ill-fitting shoes to a deal?

164
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,678
I don't think so.

165
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:04,574
If someone suspects and reports them,

166
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,435
they have to run for it,

167
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:12,108
so wearing heels they're not used to walking in are the pits!

168
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:17,957
Besides, she looks like she just got her hair done at the beauty salon!

169
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,906
-She's not the one. -Why not? Bad women don't dress up or what?

170
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:27,468
The person's waiting for a drug dealer, you know.

171
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,948
Normally, you'd think he'd come

172
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,548
dressed in plain inconspicuous clothes, right?

173
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,418
He was actually dressed way, too.

174
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:37,088
If the deal takes place in a deserted back alley or something, well...

175
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,238
but, Ebisu Bridge is bustling with people.

176
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:44,588
If a mismatched couple meets here, they would stand out,

177
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,978
and the passersby would definitely remember them.

178
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,559
Besides, the corsage on her bag doesn't fit in too, does it?

179
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,393
If the sign is a white rose,

180
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,619
she'd match the corsage to be the same color, too.

181
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:00,348
She would never use a rose of a different color

182
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,448
that would only cause confusion!

183
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,868
I see.

184
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:08,928
A fancy hairdo, ill-fitting high heels, and a rose corsage...

185
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,781
These all show that she's...

186
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:15,098
-Over here! -been invited to a wedding party or something,

187
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:17,878
and is waiting for her partner.

188
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:21,548
-Right again! -Pretty good, Osaka detective!

189
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,638
-Impressive! -I'm telling you, it's all me...

190
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:30,148
Wait a sec! So that fickle guy talking to Kazuha

191
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,798
is the drug dealer?

192
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:40,268
No way! Like I just said,

193
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:43,098
no idiots pick up girls before a deal.

194
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:45,658
Why do you keep insisting that he's trying to pick her up?

195
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:50,668
Maybe Kazuha made the first move, right?

196
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,288
Huh? No way!

197
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:56,678
Why would Kazuha want talk to that fickle looking guy?

198
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:01,378
Moreover, try get intimate with a drug dealer. Are you nuts?

199
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,298
They could've just happened to be friends, right?

200
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:08,472
Besides, the deal may have been called off for some reason,

201
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,760
so that guy may have ended up being just another ordinary guy, right?

202
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,199
Cool it, Hattori!

203
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:19,499
You'd normally figure out something like this right away, right?

204
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,228
I understand how you feel, though.

205
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,445
-It's one minute past time! -No joke?

206
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:32,087
Then maybe the dealer's already by the bridge!

207
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:34,288
Hattori! Time's up!

208
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:38,328
If the dealer comes, there's danger that Kazuha may get mixed up in this!

209
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,018
So, hurry, go get her and get out of there, both of you!

210
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:45,050
What're you doing? The video chat stopped?

211
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:50,261
I'm texting Kazuha! I'm going to ask her who that fickle guy is!

212
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,838
Give me a break, Kazuha.

213
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,038
No way! I'm not letting you go.

214
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,698
Hey, wait up.

215
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,218
Oh, it's mail from Heiji.

216
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:05,368
Huh, what am I doing? He says.

217
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,368
What's with his jacket?

218
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,018
That bulge under his arm...

219
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,378
That's...

220
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:20,348
A gun!

221
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:31,529
What's with his jacket?

222
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:34,709
That bulge under his arm...

223
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,539
That's...

224
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:39,829
A gun!

225
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:41,789
That guy...

226
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:47,642
Hey, listen well. That fickle guy...

227
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:51,114
-has a gun hidden in his chest. -What?

228
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,599
That guy... I don't know if he's a dealer or not,

229
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,449
but he's not ordinary guy.

230
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,019
Hey, Hattori! Fort the deal already!

231
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,749
Grab her by the arm and get out of there.

232
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,051
-Huh? Just what're you talking about? -She's in danger!

233
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,969
Oh no, not you! I just got mail from Kazuha!

234
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:18,570
She says, "He's Yakumaru who used to live near me.

235
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:21,270
I saw him at Ebisu Bridge,

236
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,812
and though, he told me that he was

237
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:25,512
in the pharmaceutical department at the university,

238
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:28,010
he's dressed gaudy and looks super fickle!

239
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,376
He's going on a date, he says.

240
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:34,371
That's why I decided to stick around to get a glimpse of his girl."

241
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,679
I got this stupid mail from her.

242
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,745
He's lying!

243
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,089
He belonged to a pharmaceutical department

244
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,989
and he has bleached hair, a tattoo and nose pierce?

245
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,309
No way!

246
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,439
He's just pretending to be straight to get close to Kazuha.

247
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,791
Kazuha's Dad is the head of criminal investigations department

248
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,791
of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

249
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,049
He's probably trying to get police information or something

250
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,749
by getting close.

251
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,544
Hey!

252
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,959
Hey, who are you guys? Just what do you think you're doing?

253
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,879
Kazuha!

254
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,339
Wait up, Hattori! Maybe that guy is...

255
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,139
Hey! Are you listening, Hattori?

256
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,679
Ouch! Let go, you dunce!

257
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,359
Where do you think you're touching, you imbecile! No, I said!

258
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:21,494
Who are you guys? Where are you taking me?

259
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,079
Kazuha!

260
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,129
Heiji.

261
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,649
Sorry. You're a lifesaver.

262
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:41,131
-Hey... What, hey... -Don't take the words out of my mouth!

263
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:46,583
How dare you... Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha!

264
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,839
-Heiji. -What?

265
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,129
You brought a whole army with you, huh?

266
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,859
How can you guys all be so ugly?

267
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,849
-Hey, wait... -Too late!

268
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,814
I'll throw all of you over the Dotonbori River so you can take a dive!

269
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,414
Bring it on!

270
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,259
Hey, Hattori!

271
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,299
He hung up.

272
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,049
What? That fickle man was narcotics agent?

273
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:31,264
Yeah! They investigate drug-related crimes.

274
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,774
They're called narcs or drug agents.

275
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,469
But, aren't they cops?

276
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,439
You said he wasn't a police detective!

277
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,609
No. Narcotic agents aren't police officers!

278
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:47,769
They work for the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare,

279
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,109
and since decoy investigations are legal,

280
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:55,119
bleached hair, tattoos, nose pierce, anything goes.

281
00:18:55,239 --> 00:19:00,369
Of course if their job requires, their also allowed to carry guns!

282
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,030
I've heard of something like that before.

283
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:05,658
That a lot of narcs are former pharmaceutical students

284
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:08,358
because of the nature of their jobs.

285
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,129
Yeah, that's why it hit me!

286
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:17,281
-So he was there for the investigation. -Right.

287
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,178
Inspector Otaki told me on the phone a while ago,

288
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:24,529
that the drug dealer that they arrested in Osaka,

289
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,229
spit out the locations and signs of the drug deals,

290
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:32,939
so he was disguised as the drug dealer and waited for the other party.

291
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,309
I see.

292
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:39,329
That's why he asked his colleagues to get Kazuha out of there, right?

293
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:43,379
Yeah. He didn't want the buyer to come along, and get suspicious,

294
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,079
nor did he want Kazuha to get involved.

295
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,049
It seems that the drug dealer was arrested

296
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:51,749
at the manga cafe where he was hiding,

297
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:53,889
so case closed.

298
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,959
I wonder if your master's okay?

299
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,333
Yeah. It seems he was released

300
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,333
after Inspector Otaki explained the situation.

301
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:07,879
Well, that's the least of his worries, though.

302
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,283
"Ministry of Health Kinki Public Welfare Station."

303
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,621
"General Affairs Division, Health and Welfare Dept."

304
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,018
"Narcotics Dept."

305
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,319
Those darn narcs.

306
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,699
I can't believe they went hard on a mere high school kid.

307
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,199
They don't know how to go easy.

308
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:52,659
-Hey. -On top of that, they went all out lecturing me.

309
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,329
Hey, Heiji.

310
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,194
"We'll let your father know about this."

311
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,431
Darn it, none of their business!

312
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,339
-Hey, just what did you mean back then? -Huh?

313
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,979
Since when did I become yours?

314
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:13,966
What're you talking about?

315
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:21,759
You said it, didn't you? "Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha!"

316
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,649
"I'm gonna beat you all up!"

317
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,529
I didn't say something that stupid, idiot!

318
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,218
It could've been a bit different, but it sounded something like it.

319
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,281
Hey, Heiji! Answer me!

320
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,799
-Heiji? -Shut up! Do I have to tell you?

321
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,349
Heiji...

322
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,009
I'm only going to say it once, so listen closely.

323
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:55,029
The most important thing for me is...

324
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,979
-Evidence. -Huh?

325
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,379
Don't say things that you have no evidence to back up with!

326
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:10,349
Hey, Heiji! What evidence?

327
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:12,829
My ears heard what you said.

328
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:15,119
Your ears are rotten!

329
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,639
To my dearest, precious, dear Kazuha...

330
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,909
-Dear Kazuha, my foot! -So, you do remember after all!

331
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,027
My ears are ringing so badly that I can't hear a thing!

332
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,889
Heiji!

333
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,879
Ouch!

334
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:32,062
-That's right! I'll mail Ran. -Don't!

335
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,517
I've recorded it but, oh well...

336
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,849
Just what did you do to my Kazuha!

337
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:42,899
"Next Episode."

338
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:48,008
Detective Squad Team and Cafe Team Renno, please prepare to start!

339
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:51,369
-Oh, that's us! -The time's finally come!

340
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,369
-Hey, that man... -He fell into the Teimuzu River!

341
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:57,789
Oh my God! He can't swim!

342
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,289
No, there's still something we can do.

343
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,017
We'll just wiretap.

344
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,559
Next Conan, "Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 1)"

345
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,519
Next Conan's Hint: "Telephone".

346
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:34,839
-We're going to listen again? -It's the weak point of the master, I hear.

347
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,849
This is hilarious. Here goes again!
