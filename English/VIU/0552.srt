1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,125
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest."

2
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:03,595
This is a special program

3
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:05,695
that was aired on Nichiuri TV

4
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:10,095
to choose the nationwide number 1 Mr. Kojima.

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,495
The cash to be awarded is 10,000,000 yen.

6
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,195
Moreover, the hanging scroll

7
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,795
that will be awarded along with the cash,

8
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:20,295
is one of the wild boar, deer and butterfly trio

9
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,795
called the "Bush clover and the wild boar".

10
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:24,695
Genta's father will be entering

11
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,195
the Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,095
There are 3 categories of tests, which are push up exercise,

13
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:34,295
a singing contest and kanji dictation.

14
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:38,095
The standard set for judging seemed to be quite difficult.

15
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:39,695
Overcoming these difficult tests,

16
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,795
only three contestants made it through.

17
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,395
And to our surprise,

18
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,495
Genta's father was among the finalists.

19
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:51,495
However, right before the start of the finals,

20
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,795
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -the host of this contest,

21
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,995
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Gonsaku Kojima, chairman of the Kojima Group

22
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:59,995
is pushed down the stairs by someone and killed.

23
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,995
The only people using the stairs

24
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,595
were the three Kojimas who made it to the finals.

25
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:10,195
Right. Genta's father is also one of the suspects.

26
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,795
But which of the three is Genta's father?

27
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,595
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,895
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,095
The mystery of the case, as well as Genta's father.

30
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,895
Both become clear and the case is solved.

31
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,495
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,295
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,495
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:16,324
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 2)"

35
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,979
"Contestant A's Waiting Room" -I was just

36
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:20,379
waiting in the waiting room

37
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,279
when I heard someone knocking on the door of a room.

38
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,347
A little afterwards I heard the loud voice and sound,

39
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:27,947
so I went out to look.

40
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:31,547
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Then, I found that old man

41
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,347
lying on the ground, that's all.

42
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,347
Did you come right out of the room

43
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:38,947
after you heard the loud voice and sound?

44
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:42,347
No, I waited a while.

45
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,947
Because I thought that this may be some kind of a test.

46
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:50,247
And? Was "hapyakuichi" really written on the paper?

47
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,947
Yeah, that's what was written.

48
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:55,647
By the way, how many push ups

49
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:58,747
were you able to finish in 3 minutes?

50
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,447
About a 100.

51
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:05,447
Oh, I see.

52
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:08,747
"Contestant B's Waiting Room" -Which means

53
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,747
you also heard the knock on the door of a room

54
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:15,147
and since you heard a loud voice and sound after that,

55
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:18,547
you left the room and rushed over to the site, is that right?

56
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,747
Yes.

57
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,847
"Genji Kojima (32)" -I felt a kind of uneasiness,

58
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,347
so I opened the door

59
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,147
and found that the two others were just about to leave their room.

60
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:32,147
And? On the paper, like you just said.

61
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,247
Yes, "shakuhachi" was written on it.

62
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,847
"Hapyakuichi" (801) and "shakuhachi" (Bamboo Fluter).

63
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,147
Only the "hachi" (eight) is correct.

64
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:42,547
By the way, what kind of song did you sing today?

65
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,247
I sang "Kurodabushi".

66
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,847
Would you like me to sing it to you?

67
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,547
No, not really.

68
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:48,847
Please by all means do!

69
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,447
Huh?

70
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:54,047
"Contestant C's Waiting Room" -Yeah, the same as the other two.

71
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:57,347
I heard a loud voice and sound, so I ran over.

72
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,847
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Then, I saw that old man

73
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:03,047
lying on the floor below the stairs alone.

74
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:06,347
And, on the paper that you saw,

75
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,747
the word "ippin" (first class) was written?

76
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:12,247
Yeah. "Ippin" meaning the best.

77
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:16,747
By the way, can you write the word rose in kanji?

78
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:17,947
Huh?

79
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:20,547
Rose?

80
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:23,047
I could never write a kanji like that.

81
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:26,147
Hey, what's going on from a while ago?

82
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:28,747
Well, you see...

83
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:31,947
What? Conan asked you to ask them?

84
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:35,947
Yes, sir. He said that if we ask the three questions like these,

85
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,047
we may be able to figure out

86
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,147
what the real intention of this contest is.

87
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,647
Officer Takagi, how was it?

88
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,947
They did a little over 100 push-ups,

89
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,247
sang more or less the same as Inspector Megure

90
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,347
and couldn't write the kanji character for "rose".

91
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:54,447
Don't you think I sing better?

92
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:58,547
He didn't have the lyrics for the song right, either.

93
00:05:58,547 --> 00:05:59,547
I guess so.

94
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,147
Were the lyrics incorrect?

95
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:11,847
Yeah, he was supposed to sing "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

96
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:12,947
But, he sang.

97
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:19,147
"Shinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

98
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,347
While listening to them sing,

99
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,047
I also recorded the interrogation of the three.

100
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,047
Would you like to listen to it?

101
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,447
Yep.

102
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:30,047
But, what can we figure out with this?

103
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,447
We know that the purpose of this contest

104
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,747
was not to choose the best person.

105
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:36,047
Right?

106
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,747
Yeah.

107
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,347
Just what do you mean?

108
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:42,347
I thought we were supposed to choose the number one person

109
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:45,147
of all the Mr. Kojimas nationwide,

110
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,047
but when we took the results of the push ups

111
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:50,547
to the judge's room where the chairman was.

112
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:54,247
Yeah, the contestants have already been chosen.

113
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,847
It'll be these 58 people.

114
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,347
That's what he said.

115
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:01,147
Before even looking at the records?

116
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,247
Yes.

117
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,447
It was the same even when we took the scores

118
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,647
of the kanji dictation test to him.

119
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,247
Although he seemed to be checking the VTR

120
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,847
in which the contestants all ran off over to their answer sheets.

121
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,447
Then, what about the singing contest?

122
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,547
He seemed to be listening carefully

123
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,247
to the recorded voices of each and every contestant.

124
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,647
Was the chairman choosing the contestants all by himself?

125
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:27,547
Yes. It seems that he planned to do everything by himself.

126
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,647
The chairman even got ready the number sheets and shoes

127
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,647
which were to be handed out to the contestants himself.

128
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:38,147
But, what did he base his choice on anyway?

129
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:39,647
Inspector Megure!

130
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:43,247
A gun was found inside the chairman's bag that was left

131
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,647
-in the judge's room. -What?

132
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,847
And together with it, this paper was found.

133
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,747
-Paper? -Yes.

134
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,747
It is very sloppily written.

135
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,347
"We will surely come to get a hold

136
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:56,647
of the really great best item in the world."

137
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,947
"Bandits Hyakkiyako."

138
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,647
Hyakkiyako?

139
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,947
Is it mean the group of killer robbers?

140
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,347
The thing is...

141
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,547
The chairman wrote in his blog

142
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:10,347
that he had lost the deer and butterfly hanging scrolls

143
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:12,647
of the set of three he had,

144
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,247
but the fact is the band of robbers

145
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:17,047
stole it from him about six months ago.

146
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,547
The hanging scroll of the wild boar of "Hagi"

147
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:22,347
happen to be out for repair and was spared being stolen.

148
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:25,147
Was anyone killed back then?

149
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,347
No.

150
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:29,247
The chairman, his wife and the employees

151
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,847
were all drugged to sleep.

152
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,047
But the chairman's pet dog, Gonta,

153
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,747
was slashed in the throat

154
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:39,947
with a knife by the head of that group.

155
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:43,547
And it seems that the chairman who was still slightly conscious

156
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:48,047
heard what the head had mumbled while leaving,

157
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:52,247
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

158
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,747
"After all, we could be distant relatives."

159
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:58,947
Did you report this case to the police?

160
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:03,847
No, the chairman firmly told me not to speak of it.

161
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,847
Hey, Officer Takagi.

162
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,147
Could it be that the three suspects...

163
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:15,147
Now that you mentioned it,

164
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:18,047
all three of them were like that.

165
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,347
I see.

166
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:22,447
I finally got it.

167
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,747
But...

168
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:28,247
no matter if the chairman told you to keep things quiet,

169
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:32,347
not telling the police about the break-in

170
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,447
and the hanging scrolls being stolen is unthinkable.

171
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:38,347
I'm very sorry.

172
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:41,847
But, he said that he would avenge Gonta's death,

173
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,547
so to not say a word to anyone.

174
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:46,447
Then, don't tell me that this Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest

175
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,947
that the chairman planned was...

176
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:53,247
That's right, he wasn't trying to look for the number one Mr. Kojima.

177
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:56,047
But rather to look for the culprit who took Gonta's life

178
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,447
and to avenge his death.

179
00:09:58,447 --> 00:09:59,847
And he was going to kill the culprit with the gun

180
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,647
that was hidden in the judge's room.

181
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:05,547
Because there are many kanji characters for the name Kojima

182
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,147
is usually written as "island".

183
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,947
But just like in the title of this event,

184
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,247
the "island" surname of the people in this contest

185
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,847
is kanji character with the word "bird"

186
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,847
with the radical "mountain" to the left, right?

187
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,247
Is he right?

188
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,547
Yes, sir.

189
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,847
The surnames of the three finalists

190
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:23,447
are all written that way.

191
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,647
Come to think of it, Chairman Kojima's surname

192
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,447
was also written in the same kanji character.

193
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:28,847
So, does that mean that the chairman

194
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,247
knew the name of the head of the band of robbers?

195
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,347
He didn't know it.

196
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,747
He figured it out

197
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:38,647
from what the head of the group of robbers said,

198
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:42,347
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

199
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:46,947
"After all, we may be distant relatives".

200
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,947
I see. So if he were to be a relative,

201
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,547
his name had to be written with the same kanji character Kojima.

202
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,147
Which means that

203
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,347
it's likely that he narrowed the contestants down to those whose names

204
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,847
were written with the same kanji character

205
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,747
when looking through the papers that came in.

206
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,647
I think so.

207
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:02,747
We, the staff were also thinking it's strange

208
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,947
that all the contestants had surnames written

209
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,847
in the same kanji character.

210
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,047
However,

211
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,547
I can see up to that point,

212
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,947
but how did he narrow it down after that?

213
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:17,147
Uh, the shoes that everyone was wearing when doing push ups

214
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,147
were prepared by the chairman, right?

215
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,647
Yeah. That's right.

216
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,947
Then, you checked what size who wore, right?

217
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:28,547
Yeah. Because the chairman told us to do so.

218
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:33,247
You said that Gonta was found dead in the yard, right?

219
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,347
Yeah.

220
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:37,347
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

221
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,847
If it was in the yard,

222
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,947
wouldn't it most naturally still be there?

223
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:43,647
The culprit's footprints.

224
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,947
I see! Shoes traces!

225
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:48,747
The chairman chose the contestants

226
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:53,147
according to the size of shoes they picked.

227
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:56,347
Then, the singing was to hear the voice?

228
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:59,547
Yes. If the chairman had heard the head robber's voice,

229
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:01,247
there's no doubt about it.

230
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:04,847
The voices of the remaining finalists sounded similar too.

231
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,847
If so, the kanji dictation was for him

232
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,647
to check out the handwriting of the culprit.

233
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,747
He wanted to find the man

234
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,647
whose handwriting was similar to the writing

235
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:14,947
that was written on the letter left behind by the robbers.

236
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:17,047
I don't think so!

237
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,847
Because the head of a group of robbers

238
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,347
would never go out of his way to write a letter

239
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,247
that he would leave behind.

240
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:26,347
I'm sure that letter was deliberately

241
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,447
written in handwriting unlike the usual,

242
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,947
or it's the handwriting of another person

243
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:32,247
who was made to write the letter.

244
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,547
Then, what was the dictation match for?

245
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,147
To decide whether the man is right or left handed.

246
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,647
If he slashed the dog's neck with a knife,

247
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,047
you can tell if the culprit is left handed or right

248
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:43,347
by looking at the wound, right?

249
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,247
Officer Takagi, the three suspects all used the same hand, right?

250
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:51,847
Yeah. The hand that Mr. Bunta Kojima was smoking with

251
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:55,047
and the hand that Mr. Genji Kojima was drinking tea with

252
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:56,647
as well as the hand that Mr. Dankichi Kojima used the towel

253
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,947
to wipe his perspiration were all their left hands.

254
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,547
I see.

255
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,847
That's why he was able to choose the contestants

256
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,847
just by watching the VTR of them running over

257
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,547
to the answer sheets.

258
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,747
I guess not with the voice,

259
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,447
but as far as it goes for the shoes size or what hand they dominantly use,

260
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:15,547
he could've just had the men write it in when filling out the entry forms.

261
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,947
He probably thought if he did that,

262
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:20,247
the culprit would find out that he was looking for him.

263
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,747
I see.

264
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,847
But kid, you sure have great deduction ability.

265
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,847
I got mail secretly a while ago

266
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,747
from an older detective who told me.

267
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:34,647
So, it was Kudo, after all.

268
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,847
If so, the point is the paper the chairman

269
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,847
showed to the three contestants he picked out.

270
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,147
Yes.

271
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:45,047
He figured out who the culprit was after showing the man the paper

272
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,547
and went to see him.

273
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:49,047
I think he fell off the stairs

274
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,347
fighting for the paper.

275
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:55,147
All three suspects had different answers

276
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:58,447
for the word they saw.

277
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,147
Moreover, we body checked all of them

278
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:02,947
and investigated the waiting room too,

279
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,047
but the paper in question wasn't found.

280
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:10,947
Shinichi told me he knew where the paper is.

281
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:17,247
Of course, he also knew what was written on the paper.

282
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:20,147
Conan's really late.

283
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,747
Maybe Genta's father

284
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:26,247
is involved in some case after all.

285
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,647
Well, let's let Conan handle this.

286
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:30,947
True.

287
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,947
So, Genta cut that look off your face

288
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,447
and wait for him to come back.

289
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:37,447
That's right.

290
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:41,047
Your Dad would never do anything bad, Genta!

291
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,347
I'm not really all that worried.

292
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:49,247
The only thing is I don't want them to get into a fight.

293
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:50,647
Fight?

294
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:51,847
Yeah.

295
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,047
My Dad's got a bad temper,

296
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:55,547
but is a push-over,

297
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:58,447
and he hates injustice.

298
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,547
He's got a bad temper?

299
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:02,247
He's a push-over?

300
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:05,147
He hates injustice?

301
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:08,247
He's indeed what you call a 100% "Edoite".

302
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:11,547
I guess I'll go check after all!

303
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:14,047
-Genta! -Excuse me.

304
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:19,772
"Evaluation Room" -What the hell's going on?

305
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:22,072
Gathering us in a place like this.

306
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,872
We finished interrogation a while ago, didn't we?

307
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,472
Don't tell us you figured out who the culprit is?

308
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:29,072
Oh, well...

309
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:30,572
I want to confirm with you once again

310
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:33,872
what was written on the paper.

311
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:37,172
It's "Hapyakuichi". I wrote "801".

312
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,872
It was "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

313
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,772
It was "Ippin" (First class).

314
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,972
Huh?

315
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,872
What're you guys talking about?

316
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:46,172
A number was written on it, wasn't there?

317
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,072
Yes, I thought it was a number too.

318
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,972
Don't be silly!

319
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:52,572
There couldn't be a simpler kanji!

320
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:56,872
Maybe they were all shown different papers after all.

321
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,572
-Yeah. -I'm pretty sure

322
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,672
that this was what was written on the paper.

323
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:04,372
Right, it was that character!

324
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:07,572
See? It's "hapyakuichi"!

325
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,772
But if you turn it upside down,

326
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,972
it can be read, "shakuhachi", can't it?

327
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,972
Then, when you said "shakuhachi",

328
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,472
you actually meant "hyakuhachi"?

329
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:19,472
Huh?

330
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:22,172
Yes, that's why I said "shakuhachi".

331
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,172
What the hell are you talking about?

332
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,372
Let me see it!

333
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:28,172
If you turn the word "ip" up this way,

334
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,972
it's read "ippin" meaning the best!

335
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:34,372
It's true that it could be read that way.

336
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:37,472
But it's difficult to read "pin" as the kanji "thing".

337
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,772
Well, it can't be helped!

338
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:41,672
Because that character "pin"

339
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:45,472
is written in one stroke, a habit of the writer.

340
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,472
It's hard to tell if it's part of the sentence,

341
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,372
unless you look really carefully and are used to seeing it.

342
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,872
It's really difficult to read it "pin" meaning thing.

343
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:55,672
Isn't that right, the head of the robber group?

344
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:59,272
Come to think of it, the kanji character "pin" in the letter

345
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:00,772
that was left behind by the group of robbers saying

346
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,672
they were stealing the greatest thing

347
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,172
looked similar to the "pin" here!

348
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:05,972
Of course they look similar.

349
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:07,572
I had Officer Chiba

350
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,672
copy the word "ip" and "pin"

351
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,172
and just pasted them together.

352
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,772
In other words,

353
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,972
the chairman copied these same characters on the Japanese paper

354
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,372
and showed them to you.

355
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,372
He was looking for a person who would read this not as a number,

356
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,472
but rather as the kanji character "pin".

357
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,972
And, you flew right into the trap he set up.

358
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:28,172
Don't be ridiculous.

359
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,672
If you so insist,

360
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,272
show us the Japanese paper!

361
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,772
Do you know, sir?

362
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,672
That Japanese paper is special

363
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,172
and is made with the fallen leaves of a type of mulberry tree

364
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,872
called a paper mulberry

365
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,972
and is highly toxic.

366
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,872
So, if you mistakenly lick it.

367
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,772
Don't tell me that you...

368
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,272
Ambulance.

369
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,272
Please hurry and get me an ambulance!

370
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:59,972
I ate that Japanese paper!

371
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,872
Then, you admit it?

372
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,272
That you got into a fight with the chairman over that paper,

373
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,872
he fell down the stairs

374
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:09,072
where you left him to die and you fled.

375
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,372
Yeah, I admit it.

376
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:14,472
I admit it, so hurry and call an ambulance!

377
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:15,472
While you're at it,

378
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:19,472
will you also admit that you're the head of the band of robbers?

379
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:23,472
Right, it's me! I'm the head of "Hyakkiyako"!

380
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,872
As soon as he walked into my waiting room,

381
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,272
that old man while grinning said...

382
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:31,672
Long time no see,

383
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:37,372
the head of the band of robbers who killed my pet dog.

384
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:39,872
I thought that you'd come back

385
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:42,372
to get the hanging scroll of the wild boar

386
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,772
that you failed to steal back then.

387
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,072
But don't you worry.

388
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:51,772
I may just forgive you depending how you decide to act.

389
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:54,172
If you want to flee, I won't stop you.

390
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:57,472
I'll simply report you to the police.

391
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:02,072
I've got your face right inside my TV camera,

392
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:05,672
so I've got this paper that'll serve as evidence too.

393
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:08,572
Since... since he said that I thought I'd be in trouble,

394
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,572
so I tried to snatch the paper away from him

395
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,772
then the old man fell down the stairs.

396
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:17,472
Therefore, you left the chairman there to die and fled.

397
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:20,772
Then, you swallowed the paper to hide the evidence.

398
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,972
Yeah! So, hurry and call an ambulance, will you?

399
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,372
Or, I'll die!

400
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,672
You'll be fine.

401
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,472
Mulberry leaves are frequently used to make Japanese paper,

402
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:32,672
and they're not that poisonous.

403
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,872
What... what are you saying?

404
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,372
But, unlike you, sir,

405
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,972
the mulberry is black on the outside, but white on the inside.

406
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,672
I think this taught a black on the inside person a good lesson.

407
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,672
We'll listen to the rest of story at the station.

408
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:48,572
Oh, no. I was just joking.

409
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,672
I was just playing along with that brat's joke

410
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,072
and was talking gibberish...

411
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,372
Just what do you think?

412
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,472
Enough of your lies!

413
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,372
What you just spitted out,

414
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:06,372
I was listening with these two ears of mine!

415
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,772
Cut out your blabbering!

416
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:12,272
Like I just said, I was only joking.

417
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:15,672
Oh, you still insist on playing dumb?

418
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,772
You third rate human!

419
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,372
Third rate human.

420
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,172
I run a liquor store, you know!

421
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:23,372
I'm used to taking on drunkards!

422
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,272
Or better yet,

423
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:27,872
you want me to stick my arm all the way down your throat

424
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,872
and pull that Japanese paper out of your throat

425
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:32,972
together with what you ate for lunch today?

426
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:36,872
Oh, no. I confess.

427
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:39,072
Dad?

428
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,872
Dad, what's up?

429
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:44,272
Genta.

430
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:48,372
Don't tell me that Genta's dad is the culprit?

431
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:11,172
Dad.

432
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:14,172
Just what're you doing in a place like this?

433
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:16,972
Oh, Genta!

434
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:19,372
What's with those glasses?

435
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,972
Oh, this is...

436
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:25,572
What? Mom told you to wear it?

437
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:28,072
You mean to enter this contest?

438
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:31,572
Yeah! She nagged me saying

439
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:33,972
that I look smarter with then on so to wear them!

440
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:37,772
But, it looks like your granny's glasses

441
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,272
and the lens are so strong

442
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,472
that I can't keep my eyes open.

443
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:45,472
Talk about tough. She also told me a whole lot of other stuff like

444
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:49,972
to watch my language or not fight and all.

445
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:53,072
But, why did you read that character "shakuhachi"?

446
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,672
Yes, yes. Officer Takagi told us

447
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:58,672
that you read "shakuhachi" instead of "hyakuhachi".

448
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,272
It's because he's an "edoite".

449
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:06,572
Although they think they're pronouncing something "he" or "hya",

450
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:11,172
most "edoites" can't help but pronounce the words "she" or "sha".

451
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,572
Well, it's something like a dialect.

452
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,872
Sir, did you remember that you sang "Shinomoto ichi"

453
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:19,672
at the part that goes "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo"

454
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,972
in the song Kurodabushi?

455
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,372
Huh? Is that how it sounded?

456
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:25,772
I see.

457
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:29,272
That's how you figured out he was Genta's father.

458
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,172
Yeah, because the other two

459
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,572
pronounced the words "hikaeshitsu" (waiting room) and "hitori" (alone)

460
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:35,872
the way they were supposed to be pronounced.

461
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,372
But, dad, if we went a little later than we did,

462
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,472
you would've gotten into a fight again, right?

463
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:45,172
Well, never mind the details.

464
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:49,072
Like they say, fire and fighting are like spice to edoites.

465
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:55,672
I mean talk about totally out of date.

466
00:23:57,417 --> 00:24:01,717
"Next Episode" -I see. You arrested Togashi before.

467
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:05,117
But, that person isn't left handed.

468
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:08,017
He'll be sent to the prosecutor as scheduled at 4 pm.

469
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:11,917
What? He throw the murder weapon at the window?

470
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,317
Only a night has passed yet,

471
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,317
so if you search for an eye-witness...

472
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,517
That's it!

473
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:19,717
He'll be committed to trial at 4 pm.

474
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:21,417
That's the time limit.

475
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:27,417
Next Conan, "The Interrogation Room".

476
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,372
Next Conan's Hint:

477
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:46,572
"Left handed."

478
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:47,572
How about you, Officer Takagi?

479
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:48,772
I'm a top-notch officer, so you see.

480
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:49,872
I think I heard something, but I must've heard wrong.

481
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:53,872
Oops.
