1
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:07,229
Ran won travel vouchers in a lottery, so we came to Kanazawa for sightseeing.

2
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:11,068
While there, we ran into Hayashi Mari-san,

3
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:12,569
who was transporting ransom money for a kidnapping case.

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,674
The hostage Saikawa Manabu-san was released,

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,529
and we were initially relieved, but... Saikawa Manabu (55)

6
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:25,939
It became clear that the kidnapping was an act put on by Manabu-san, and he fled.

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,899
The police are pursuing him, and it's only a matter of time before the case is solved.

8
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,298
Hayashi Soichi (52) Hayashi Draper President

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,009
At least, it should have been...

10
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:50,129
You think you'll get away with this?

11
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,858
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

12
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,738
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

13
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,608
Too many mysteries for one kidnapping case!

14
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,458
Don't let the silks become stained with malice!

15
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,068
Always determining the one truth

16
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,798
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

17
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,259
his name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:00,003
The Young Kaga Lady's Mystery Tour (Part Two)

Kayatamatsu Hot Spring Geisha Call Office "Hanayakata"

22
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,704
Whoops.

23
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:21,892
It's Mari-san.

24
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:35,811
What happened?

25
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:37,612
I'm not sure.

26
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,250
Kaede Yuko (40) Hayashi Draper Accountant, When I came to

27
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,622
clean before we open, I found the president on the ground.

28
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:46,622
Dad, how's Soichi-san?

29
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:50,792
He's unconscious, but he'll live.

30
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,382
Good.

31
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,512
Hey, where's Rintaro-san?

32
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,531
I tried calling him, but he won't answer.

33
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,261
He's probably still asleep.

34
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,281
Why does he have to be asleep now?

35
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,642
Mari!

36
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:09,902
Are you okay?

37
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:14,402
Kondo Takumi (24) Mari's Boyfriend, My father... My father...

38
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:17,741
Mister, what did the police say?

39
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:23,162
Since he still had his wallet, it's unlikely he was attacked by a robber.

40
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:27,252
And they found footprints belonging to three individuals at the crime scene.

41
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:32,171
One set belongs to the president, but they still don't know whose the other two are.

42
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,521
Does that mean he was attacked by two people?

43
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:36,612
Probably.

44
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:41,052
Where did President Hayashi go after we parted ways last night?

45
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,851
He went to put the money away in the safe in his office.

46
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,972
What time was that?

47
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:52,071
I believe it was around 11 PM.

48
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,112
I see. And after that?

49
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:59,112
I don't know. I went straight to my room.

50
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,962
Mister, what's that?

51
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,001
That's gold dust.

52
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:16,871
What's it doing here?

53
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:22,632
Come to think of it, I saw gold dust on Soichi-san when he was being carried away.

54
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:32,142
Maybe Takumi-san works with gold dust at his job.

55
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:35,541
Look at Takumi-san's hands.

56
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,402
They have a rash on them.

57
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:40,981
It's probably because of lacquer.

58
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,992
And look at his bracelet.

59
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,641
It's to prevent static electricity, right?

60
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:48,912
Kanazawa is famous for its gold foil.

61
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:52,542
Lacquer is used as an adhesive for gold foil,

62
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:55,391
and static electricity makes gold foil stick to things,

63
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,421
so the bracelet is meant to prevent that, right?

64
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,171
Well?

65
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,531
That's right.

66
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,842
I'm an apprentice in traditional Kanazawa gold foil crafts.

67
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,901
So, what?

68
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:11,182
If your gold dust was stuck to the president, that means you met with him last night.

69
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:12,561
Am I wrong?

70
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,692
You think I did it?

71
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:16,441
I didn't do it!

72
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,442
Then why don't you explain why there was gold dust stuck to the president?

73
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,692
Takumi-san, answer him.

74
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:28,452
Fine.

75
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:33,212
Last night, I went to the president's office to steal some money.

76
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:38,142
If he had 30 million yen, I thought he wouldn't notice if a little bit went missing.

77
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:42,462
But he caught me and grabbed me by the collar.

78
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,762
That must've been when the gold dust stuck to—

79
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,491
Why did you do that?

80
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,222
Because I don't have enough money.

81
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:53,272
What?

82
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:58,511
I burn through all my money trying to keep up with your spending habits.

83
00:06:58,512 --> 00:06:59,951
Why would you put it like that?

84
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,152
Now, now. Let's calm down.

85
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,411
Instead of that, for now let's focus on the attack on the president.

86
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,572
I told you, I didn't do it!

87
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:13,061
Really? You didn't attack him to keep him quiet?

88
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,752
I said I didn't do it!

89
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,471
Hey, mister.

90
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:19,501
What? I'm on a roll right now.

91
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,412
Isn't this sawdust?

92
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,262
Do you use sawdust at your job, too?

93
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,511
I don't use that stuff.

94
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,562
Then what is this?

95
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,761
Maybe it's hikiko.

96
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:37,062
It's a kind of sawdust passed through a sieve.

97
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:41,322
Printed silk makers use it to prevent dyeing.

98
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:42,582
Right?

99
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,572
That's right. You're well informed.

100
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,142
I've seen it on TV before.

101
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:52,582
If that hikiko stuff was on the weapon,

102
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:57,141
then it's likely one of the printed silk makers Hagino Rintaro

103
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,252
or Saikawa Manabu touched the weapon.

104
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,462
Mari-san, is something wrong?

105
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,981
I-It's nothing.

106
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:06,962
Really?

107
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:10,852
Hiding it won't do you any good.

108
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:14,262
Very well. I'll tell you.

109
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:19,272
I saw Manabu-san running off last night from my window.

110
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,621
Why didn't you mention something so important?

111
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,492
Because...

112
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:37,002
I knew Manabu-san would be suspected if I did.

113
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,931
Of course he would be!

114
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,262
He resents your father because he failed to steal the money once.

115
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,621
It's possible he returned last night to try to steal the money again,

116
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:50,932
ran into the president, and struck him without thinking.

117
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:55,301
I can't imagine Manabu-san hurting my father!

118
00:08:55,302 --> 00:09:00,331
But he did in fact try to trick him out of his money with a fake kidnapping.

119
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,632
We were at fault in that as well!

120
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:04,772
Hey...

121
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,912
Why is Mari-san so desperate to defend Manabu-san?

122
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:15,541
Because to Mari-chan, Manabu-san is like a foster parent to her.

123
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,912
A foster parent?

124
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,912
When President Hayashi was busy with work,

125
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:26,542
Manabu-san would play with Mari-chan instead.

126
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,612
Really?

127
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:36,432
In any case, he has motive, and he was witnessed at the crime scene.

128
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,022
A withheld number?

129
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:43,942
Hello?

130
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,512
Put my phone on speaker?

131
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:48,292
Very well.

132
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:50,942
Listen closely!

133
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,202
I have Rintaro!

134
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:57,812
If you want him returned safely, give me back my 30 million!

135
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:04,031
What do you mean, you have Rintaro?

136
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:07,962
I'll send you the time and place for the drop off later!

137
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:11,722
I'm serious this time!

138
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,222
Hey, cut out this nonsense!

139
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:19,852
What?

140
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:22,212
R-Rintaro-san!

141
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,712
Damn that Manabu.

142
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,362
Is he determined not to give up?

143
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,671
Mori-san, what should we do?

144
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:39,992
To be safe, you should prepare the ransom money.

145
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:41,612
Very well.

146
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:50,682
Mari-san, could you show me that photo again?

147
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,262
Thank you.

148
00:10:56,212 --> 00:11:00,712
I don't see any clues that will help us identify where he's being held.

149
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,202
What's this?

150
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,762
Hey, Yuko-san.

151
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,432
I'd like to ask you something.

152
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:13,532
What is it?

153
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:17,461
Manabu-san and Rintaro-san are master and apprentice, right?

154
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,491
Did they get along?

155
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,032
Those two?

156
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:25,012
Well, between the two of us,

157
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:30,042
I don't think Rintaro-kun thought very highly of Manabu-san.

158
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,052
What? Really?

159
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:37,642
I secretly follow Rintaro-kun's social media accounts.

160
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:46,902
Seems like Rintaro-san really dislikes Manabu-san.

161
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,142
But if that's true, then why...?

162
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:51,692
I don't believe this!

163
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:55,382
I trusted you and Manabu-san!

164
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,202
You're the worst!

165
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:00,371
I couldn't resist.

166
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:04,622
Anyone would lose control of themselves with that much money in front of them.

167
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:05,971
You're lying!

168
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:10,541
You pretended to like me, but you only ever approached me because you wanted my money!

169
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,742
My father was right!

170
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,511
So that's how it is.

171
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:18,632
Which means we'd better find them soon.

172
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:24,171
There weren't any clues identifying the location in the photo.

173
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,642
The only other clue we have is...

174
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,042
That threatening call just now!

175
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,152
I see.

176
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:50,981
Conan-kun, why did you suddenly want to come to Komatsu?

177
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,172
I'm curious about something.

178
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,172
Curious?

179
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:56,632
What does that mean?

180
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,302
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,302
Manabu-san?!

182
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:04,932
Wait!

183
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,391
Science Hills Komatsu

184
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:09,982
Science Hills Komatsu

185
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:13,622
Humanity and Manufacturing Science Museum

186
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:20,112
Damn. Where did he go?

187
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,621
My clothes are soaked!

188
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:28,451
That old fart didn't even apologize for running into me!

189
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:31,252
Do you know which way he went?

190
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,752
Huh? Yeah. He went that way.

191
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,372
Conan-kun, where's Manabu-san?

192
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:46,512
I lost him.

193
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:51,642
Conan-kun, did you come here knowing Manabu-san would be here?

194
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:55,152
When I listened to Manabu-san's threatening call again,

195
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:58,372
I heard airplanes in the background.

196
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:03,811
The only airport near Kanazawa is Komatsu Airport,

197
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:05,662
so I thought he might be here.

198
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:07,362
I see.

199
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:09,801
But we lost him.

200
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:12,662
Let's call the police and let them handle the rest.

201
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,172
What's that?

202
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,021
An anthocyanin solution.

203
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:30,062
They were making some at the science museum's children's lab, so I borrowed a little.

204
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,941
What are you going to do with it?

205
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:36,812
An anthocyanin solution changes color depending on the pH value.

206
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:41,622
If we spray it someplace Manabu-san probably passed through...

207
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,322
Footprints!

208
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:47,822
The cola Manabu-san spilled when he ran into that man is a strong acid.

209
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:54,332
It reacted with the anthocyanin solution, making his footprints visible.

210
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,832
Really? I'm impressed you know that.

211
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,652
I-I learned about it in science class.

212
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,841
So this is where we're dropping off the ransom money.

213
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,312
Dad.

214
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:15,747
What are you doing here?

215
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:19,377
Well, we followed Manabu-san's footprints.

216
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:25,367
Whatever. Dropping off this ransom money comes first.

217
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:29,386
You guys wait here. Got it?

218
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,167
Okay.

219
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,617
Rintaro-san.

220
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,247
You're all right now.

221
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:01,237
Y-You saved me.

222
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,897
Thank you.

223
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,257
Where's Manabu?

224
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,986
He took his things and ran.

225
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,706
So he was scared of being caught and fled.

226
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,927
Rintaro-san.

227
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,267
Ran! And what are all of you doing here?

228
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:22,527
We were worried and couldn't sit still.

229
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,027
I see.

230
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,726
As you can see, the hostage is all right.

231
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,737
I'm off to find Manabu who ran from—

232
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:36,037
Dad?

233
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:40,417
There's something I must make clear first.

234
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,167
Huh? What?

235
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:46,926
Rintaro-san, why don't you cut the act?

236
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,427
The act? What are you talking about?

237
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:54,456
You pretending to be a hostage, obviously.

238
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,937
What? What are you talking about?

239
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:02,097
In the photo of you, there was a rectangular bulge in your pocket.

240
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,937
Judging by its shape, it was a smart phone.

241
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:09,947
You're right. But what about this?

242
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:14,146
Normally a kidnapper would take a smart phone off a hostage.

243
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,556
But Manabu-san didn't do that.

244
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:18,207
Why not?

245
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,006
The answer is simple.

246
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:25,267
Because he wasn't concerned about him calling for help even if he had a phone on him.

247
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:29,837
In other words, Rintaro-san, you're working with Manabu-san.

248
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:34,967
Rintaro-san, is that true?

249
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:40,016
I had the police share your call history with me.

250
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,487
I know you've been communicating frequently with Manabu-san since last night.

251
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,857
Your excuses won't work.

252
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,487
Impressive work, Sleeping Kogoro.

253
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,057
Why would you do this?

254
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:59,497
I felt bad for my master, so I decided to help him steal the money.

255
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,997
Outwardly, that was your reason.

256
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:03,997
Outwardly?

257
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,007
Rintaro-san knew how to open the safe.

258
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,736
If he simply wanted to help,

259
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:14,507
there was no need for them to do something as drastic as faking a kidnapping.

260
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:19,517
They could have simply stolen the money from the safe.

261
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:23,017
Then why did Rintaro-san do what he did?

262
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:28,917
Because he planned to pretend to help Manabu-san before killing him.

263
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:31,277
N-No...

264
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:39,286
Rintaro-san rather harshly expressed his hatred for Manabu-san on social media.

265
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,557
No. It's not true, is it?

266
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:47,026
"A craftsman steals his techniques" is nothing but hazing.

267
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,017
It was so hard.

268
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,496
But you didn't have to kill him!

269
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,297
You have no right to criticize me.

270
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:58,347
I planned to kill my master, but I didn't do it.

271
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:02,306
In other words, I'm not a criminal yet.

272
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,316
No, you are a criminal.

273
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,966
What are you talking about?

274
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:11,317
There were three sets of footprints found where President Hayashi was attacked.

275
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:15,376
One set belonged to President Hayashi, and another belonged to Manabu-san.

276
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,327
The remaining one is yours.

277
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,327
I don't know anything about that!

278
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,666
An examination would clear things up immediately.

279
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,627
B-But just because I was at the crime scene,

280
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:29,547
that doesn't mean I struck the president.

281
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:34,346
No. The rock used as the weapon was too heavy to lift in one hand.

282
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:38,117
Manabu-san injured his dominant hand and could only use one.

283
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,646
In other words, you were the only person at the crime scene

284
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,557
who could have struck President Hayashi.

285
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:47,687
Damn it.

286
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,067
It's the president's fault.

287
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:56,847
Wasn't your target Manabu-san?

288
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,077
Why would you do something so cruel to my father?

289
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:06,457
The president caught me telling my master to fake a kidnapping.

290
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,807
Without thinking, I grabbed the rock.

291
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,457
You can tell the police all about it.

292
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:21,227
But where's Manabu-san?

293
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:24,867
What's that?

294
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,227
Ran, flip over the mat!

295
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:31,687
A bloodstain.

296
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,857
Probably Manabu-san's.

297
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,357
Where is Manabu-san?!

298
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:45,207
If he already attacked Manabu-san, he wouldn't have had time to take him outside.

299
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,867
He's probably here somewhere in this room.

300
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,587
Ran, check that closet!

301
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,127
Why would you do this?

302
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:02,956
He probably planned to finish off Manabu-san after tricking us,

303
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:08,897
making the police continue their search for the supposedly escaped Manabu-san forever.

304
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:18,487
Manabu-san, I can't believe this happened.

305
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:25,247
Manabu-san, you're alive.

306
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:28,317
Good.

307
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,706
After Rintaro-san and Manabu-san were arrested,

308
00:22:56,707 --> 00:23:00,087
Soichi-san was able to leave the hospital.

309
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,596
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital.

310
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,527
Thanks.

311
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:07,586
What are you going to do now? All your craftsmen are gone.

312
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,097
I know. The company is in big trouble.

313
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:13,476
I can't believe this turned into such a major case.

314
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,857
Perhaps I ought to reflect on my own actions as well.

315
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,856
Let me handle it.

316
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,946
I'll follow in Manabu-san and Rintaro-san's footsteps and become a printed silk maker.

317
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,296
You?

318
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:28,007
Yes. Despite how I look, I'm confident in my artistic ability.

319
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:31,047
These are my artistic skills! Well?

320
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:34,976
Mari, that's fantastic!

321
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,626
I had no idea you had such hidden talent!

322
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:39,776
The company's future is secure now!

323
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:43,237
A new wave printed silk maker is born.
