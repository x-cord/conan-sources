1
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:05,394
I can't.

2
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:09,644
I can't do it.

3
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:20,204
If I just tell her how I feel someplace with beautiful scenery, I'll be losing to Kudo.

4
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,874
If I'm going to beat him, I'll have to steel my resolve.

5
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:34,134
After all, at the Kiyomizu Temple butai in front of all those people,

6
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,634
he kissed her.

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,524
He went all out.

8
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:47,224
It really was mouth-to-mouth.

9
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:50,823
He should've told me beforehand that he was going to do that.

10
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,233
He surprised me.

11
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,203
What surprised you?

12
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:55,484
K-Kazuha?

13
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:57,484
I bought tea.

14
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:58,654
Here.

15
00:00:58,655 --> 00:00:59,994
Thanks.

16
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:03,273
So, what surprised you?

17
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:06,743
Th-That the museum where Kudo—

18
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:12,703
I mean, Conan-kun and the others are meeting us today might be visited by Kaito Kid.

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,793
That sure surprised me.

20
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,254
I know!

21
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:22,803
There was a rumor that Kid was standing on top of the Tsutenkaku Tower the other day,

22
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:24,144
but I didn't see him myself.

23
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,093
I'm excited!

24
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:27,533
Y-Yeah...

25
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:30,644
Speaking of excitement, I'm excited about Kid's target,

26
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:35,473
the world's largest pearl, the Fairy Lip.

27
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:40,074
I wish I could see that thin pink-colored pearl now.

28
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,324
"Fairy Lip."

29
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:44,574
A pixie's lips...

30
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:48,454
A pixie's... lips...

31
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,114
Her... lips...

32
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:56,634
Hey, Heiji!

33
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,283
What's gotten into you?

34
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:01,793
You've been staring at my mouth.

35
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,933
Oh, uh, yeah...

36
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,014
It's seaweed. I had takoyaki this morning.

37
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:10,184
If Ran-chan and the others see, they'll laugh at me.

38
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,024
Takoyaki, huh?

39
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:15,084
Bet they taste like sauce.

40
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,013
Find the question that solves the mystery!

41
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,904
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

42
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:26,784
Kid's target is the Fairy Lip!

43
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,373
The anxious Heiji's target is a kiss?

44
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,933
Always determining the one truth

45
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,623
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

46
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,084
his name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:19,859
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips (Part One)

48
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:20,979
What?

49
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,109
You're almost at Shin-Yokohama?

50
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:24,012
Yeah.

51
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,062
Yeah. I'll meet you at Tokyo Station.

52
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:29,052
Wait for me there, Kazuha-chan.

53
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:33,692
Steal It If You Can!!

54
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:37,421
Anyway, are we seriously going to this museum?

55
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:41,911
We probably won't get a good look at the jewel because of all the crazy security.

56
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,202
Oh, but it says,

57
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,631
"Arrangements have been made

58
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:51,212
that allow the jewel to be seen clearly from all angles."

59
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:54,592
He can actually read the kanji.

60
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:58,092
They may have set up something special.

61
00:04:58,262 --> 00:04:59,367
One Week Earlier

62
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,852
This won't do.

63
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:07,181
This security will allow that moonlit magician

64
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,652
to easily steal the jewel and run off with it.

65
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:13,511
I'm willing to ignore him stealing the jewel.

66
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:18,032
But don't you have any better strategies to prevent him from escaping?

67
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,412
I told you,

68
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:24,201
if we increase the number of security guards around the jewel,

69
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,872
he won't steal it in the first place.

70
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,191
But if we bring in more guards,

71
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:33,502
the guests coming to see the jewel won't be able to enjoy themselves.

72
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,841
I don't care about the guests.

73
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:40,022
They're probably mostly Kid fans anyway.

74
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:46,561
In any case, we have one week until the jewel goes on display.

75
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,982
We have to come up with a better plan by then.

76
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:55,482
We'll probably end up seeing that smug scoundrel's audacious smile again.

77
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:03,781
I came all the way down to the Metropolitan Police Department, but I wasted my time.

78
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:07,781
But, sir, Inspector Nakamori is right.

79
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:11,002
Shouldn't we tighten security around the jewel?

80
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:16,641
For example, we could encase the jewel's display box inside a metal cage.

81
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,472
Even if we did that, he'd steal it anyway.

82
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,611
Like I said, the best defense is a good offense.

83
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:25,472
We have to come up with a way to keep him from escaping.

84
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:30,451
Attacking the outside without fortifying the inside is a foolish plan.

85
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,142
What?

86
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:39,692
It's what a famous Chinese tactician once said.

87
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,511
Are you with the police?

88
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:45,251
Yes, though not the MPD.

89
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:49,131
But how am I supposed to fortify the inside?

90
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:54,372
People always question if I have any intention of displaying the object to guests.

91
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,402
Then how about this?

92
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:03,221
I-Is this...

93
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,262
Ice?

94
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,912
They stuck the jewel inside ice?

95
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,772
I see.

96
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:16,272
It certainly allows it to be seen clearly from all angles.

97
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,581
But it's just ice.

98
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:23,211
Heat will melt it, and it can be drilled through.

99
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:25,282
Don't worry about that.

100
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:30,792
Using a blowtorch to melt this much ice would take a long time,

101
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:37,191
and it's impossible to extract the jewel with a drill without scratching it.

102
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:40,581
Furthermore, we've enclosed the jewel's display area in hard glass,

103
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:45,052
and lowered the temperature compared to other rooms.

104
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,751
Not only does it make the ice harder to melt,

105
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,691
but since security is outside the glass,

106
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:56,062
it allows the jewel to be observed without an oppressive air of intimidation.

107
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:59,341
This is a great idea that you came up with.

108
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,941
It wasn't my idea.

109
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,902
It was the good idea of the man who returned to offer his assistance again today,

110
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:11,662
Nagano Prefectural Police Section 1's Inspector Morofushi Takaaki.

111
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,641
I simply suggested that using ice

112
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,672
would allow guests to enjoy a cool and refreshing experience.

113
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:24,172
Though I did recommend that we implement the idea immediately once we came up with it.

114
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:27,341
They say celerity is the soul of warfare.

115
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,001
Celerity?

116
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,182
It's a famous saying from the Annals of the Three Kingdoms.

117
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:34,102
Inspector Morofushi, what are you doing here?

118
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:39,481
The truth is, I came here the other day to confirm something,

119
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:43,492
but the detective on the case was out conducting an investigation,

120
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:46,441
so I couldn't meet with him, so I returned today.

121
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,292
And there was that female officer serial murder case...

122
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:52,861
Confirm something?

123
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,662
A letter addressed to me.

124
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,141
To be precise, it's a letter that seemed to be addressed to me.

125
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:01,261
The letters are blurred and difficult to read.

126
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,632
The sender is unknown as well.

127
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:07,711
Though I did choose to return to Tokyo today

128
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:11,642
because General Advisor Suzuki Jirokichi asked me to come.

129
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,311
Ran-chan, do you know that detective?

130
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:18,481
Yeah, from a case that happened in Nagano.

131
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:22,981
Apparently he's childhood friends with Inspector Yamato Kansuke

132
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,902
and Detective Uehara Yui, who you've met before.

133
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,311
Really?

134
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,761
Inspector Yamato calls him Komei.

135
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:35,041
Apparently he's actually as smart as Zhuge Kongming.

136
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:35,912
I see.

137
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:46,462
Two high school detectives and a tactician-like cop from Nagano?

138
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:51,751
I guess I won't steal it tonight.

139
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:55,102
And as the days go by, that block of ice will gradually get smaller.

140
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:59,681
Anyway, it's an impressive pearl.

141
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,482
Certainly for its color and size,

142
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,211
but this pattern on the surface is exquisite.

143
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:08,741
It truly is worthy of the name Fairy Lip.

144
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,881
It's no wonder the general advisor invited you.

145
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:14,872
You've got a good eye.

146
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:19,031
This pearl was found inside a giant oyster

147
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,291
sleeping at the bottom of Mie Prefecture's Ago Bay.

148
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:26,221
I was drawn to the brilliance of the pearl's unique orient effect,

149
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:30,262
and paid a huge sum for that one-of-a-kind jewel.

150
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:35,762
I'm honored to be part of this plan to capture Kid.

151
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:40,391
In exchange, I expect to be compensated if it actually is stolen.

152
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,262
Of course.

153
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:45,721
After all, this jewel already received a high offer at an auction,

154
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,761
and is my personal possession.

155
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:48,961
He's lying!

156
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:53,531
That's a gift my grandfather received from a wealthy Caribbean man

157
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:55,122
while he was traveling overseas!

158
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:59,741
I let you hold onto it because you said you'd determine its value,

159
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,252
but you won't return it!

160
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:05,671
I looked into yours because it looked similar to my own pearl,

161
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,341
but as I recall, I already returned yours to you.

162
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:10,261
Yeah, you sure returned the ring!

163
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:14,402
After swapping the jewel out for a fake pearl!

164
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,491
What's the meaning of this?

165
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:22,442
I get crazy customers like her sometimes.

166
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,692
In any case, give it back!

167
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:30,502
That pearl was the wedding ring my grandfather gave to my grandmother!

168
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,612
I want to put it my late grandmother's coffin

169
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,621
so she can take it with her to heaven!

170
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,782
Let go of me!

171
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:41,121
My grandmother's funeral is tomorrow!

172
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,231
I'm running out of time!

173
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,202
Let go!

174
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,511
I see.

175
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,131
In that case...

176
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:50,671
Well? Have we still not received a note from Kid?

177
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,382
We haven't heard a peep out of him yet.

178
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,192
Inspector Nakamori.

179
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,712
What is it?

180
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,352
There's a strange ball over there.

181
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,181
Is this a BB pellet?

182
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:10,232
What's it doing here?

183
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:11,941
Inspector Nakamori.

184
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,492
Huh?

185
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,492
There's a card on the bottom of your shoe.

186
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,902
What's this?

187
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:23,752
"Tonight at midnight, I shall come to take the fairy's lip."

188
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,922
Kaito Kid is coming after all!

189
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,762
"I shall come to take the fairy's lip."

190
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:37,502
To take the lip...

191
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,324
Kaito Kid is coming after all!

192
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,134
To take the lip...

193
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:56,444
Heiji, you're staring at my mouth again!

194
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,673
I do have seaweed on my mouth!

195
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,153
Ran-chan, look!

196
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,943
There's nothing there.

197
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,174
I-It's not that!

198
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:05,723
Hey, Kid is—

199
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,493
Sh-Shut up!

200
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,383
I haven't said anything yet.

201
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,184
Is there something wrong with you?

202
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:13,163
There's nothing wrong with me!

203
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:17,623
Heiji, you've been acting weird since we returned from Kyoto.

204
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:18,604
Kyoto?

205
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:23,614
Come to think of it, Hattori-kun was there at the Kiyomizu Temple butai.

206
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,364
If he saw that...

207
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:35,494
Kazuha-chan, this time I might actually sense love in the air.

208
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:37,124
Love?

209
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,504
Yeah, love.

210
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,463
Ran-chan, I've had enough of that.

211
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,273
But I appreciate the thought.

212
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:49,014
What? But it's really for real this time.

213
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:55,243
Anyway, when did Kid stick this card on the bottom of my shoe?

214
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,283
Maybe it's been there since before you got here.

215
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,024
You'd already decided that you'd be coming here.

216
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:04,803
Actually, it seems he only just decided to act.

217
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:05,364
What?

218
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:12,744
Look. The card over here says he'll arrive tomorrow at 8 PM.

219
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:16,403
This card says he'll come the day after tomorrow.

220
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,414
There's even a card that says he'll pass this time.

221
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,103
What does this mean?

222
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,834
He placed cards for various times around the room beforehand.

223
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,933
Once he'd chosen a card,

224
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,303
by having Inspector Nakamori walk over, step on,

225
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:30,453
and show the note to the rest of us,

226
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,843
regardless of the fact that he'd only just made his decision,

227
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:38,434
he wanted us to think that he'd thought long and hard on his plan.

228
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:44,243
Naturally, he probably intended to secretly collect these extra cards later.

229
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:45,114
I see.

230
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:50,993
In other words, the officer who just told me about the strange ball is Kid.

231
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,154
Where is he?

232
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:56,083
Was it you?

233
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:59,204
N-No! Perhaps he's already left?

234
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,583
Shit.

235
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,714
That tactician-like cop saw through everything.

236
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:10,063
It's true that I just came up with that plan,

237
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:14,723
but since I've already rigged the ceiling, it's worth testing it out.

238
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:18,673
The question is what to do about that detective kid

239
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,104
with the glasses and the high school detective from Osaka.

240
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,703
Hey, Heiji.

241
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:24,814
Y-Yeah?

242
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:26,403
What do you want to do?

243
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,663
I was thinking we could stay at Ran-chan's place tonight.

244
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,803
As long as we're here, I've got to stay here until tonight

245
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:35,204
and help them catch Kid.

246
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,714
You're right.

247
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,744
Then I'll stay here and help, too.

248
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:41,093
Y-You idiot!

249
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,623
We're up against Kid here.

250
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:43,993
It's too dangerous. You should leave.

251
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,174
I see...

252
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:49,044
I might get in your way if I stay here.

253
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:54,673
W-Well, if you insist on staying, then I suppose it can't be helped...

254
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:55,554
Really?

255
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,403
I-If you want to stay, then it can't be helped.

256
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:00,823
I see.

257
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,564
I can use this.

258
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:06,814
Anyway, are you sure just the ice is enough?

259
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:09,193
I had the same thought,

260
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:14,704
so I had the ring swapped out for one with an internal sensor.

261
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,073
If he passes through that exit while holding the ring,

262
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,913
an alarm will sound.

263
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:24,593
Furthermore, next to the door is an emergency button.

264
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:28,084
Once pressed, the door is locked for ten minutes.

265
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:32,253
In other words, if we press the button one minute before the time he declared,

266
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:37,974
Kid's crime can be stopped before it begins, ending in failure.

267
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:44,113
Then articles describing how I stopped his crime will be printed in newspapers,

268
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:47,984
and I'll reclaim my spot on the front page!

269
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:53,984
Wouldn't it be faster for you to buy the whole newspaper company?

270
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:58,963
Damn it. Our plan is to stop Kid from coming instead of catch him?

271
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,994
I hardly feel motivated.

272
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:04,734
A commander without courage is no commander at all.

273
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,143
It means if the commander of an army is without courage,

274
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,254
then it's like there is no commander on the field.

275
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,633
I-I know that.

276
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,133
Inspector, the regular guests are entering the museum.

277
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:16,764
Got it.

278
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,963
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

279
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,353
You'd better hurry.

280
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:29,024
I will.

281
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,043
Ran-chan, Ran-chan!

282
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,673
That thing's kind of funny looking.

283
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,953
You're right. It's so funny.

284
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,413
Hey, Kudo.

285
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:37,154
What?

286
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:40,313
Is Kid really that tough?

287
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,264
Yeah.

288
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:44,373
He's cunning. It's never straightforward with him.

289
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,533
Really?

290
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:48,374
In that case, if I catch that thief...

291
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,793
I'm impressed, Heiji!

292
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,674
You're way better than Kudo-kun!

293
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,044
Of course I am.

294
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:59,203
I wouldn't mind you showing you something even better.

295
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,094
Heiji...

296
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,314
That's it!

297
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,434
Heiji, you should look at this—

298
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,564
I'm all sticky from the soda.

299
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,303
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

300
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,243
You can't bring drinks in here.

301
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:22,203
I can't read Japanese.

302
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:24,704
I think it was written in English, too.

303
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,673
I just bought these clothes.

304
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:28,703
You can have them to make up for it.

305
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,004
It's fine.

306
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,614
Please take them.

307
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:34,433
Anyway, I'm sorry.

308
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:36,133
Hey, wait!

309
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:36,864
Huh?

310
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,744
This dress is from that brand the magazines are saying is popular this year.

311
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:41,734
Really?

312
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,464
Yeah.

313
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:45,654
As long as she's offering, why not accept it?

314
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:49,473
You have to get changed anyway.

315
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:50,894
Y-You're right.

316
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,624
In that case, I'm going to go change in the bathroom.

317
00:18:57,984 --> 00:18:59,364
Heiji!

318
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,614
Tada!

319
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:04,853
How do I look?

320
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,374
So cute.

321
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:08,053
Well, Heiji?

322
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:10,083
Have you fallen in love with me again?

323
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,664
Y-Yeah, I guess...

324
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,223
Are you stupid?!

325
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:14,964
I was never in love with you to begin with!

326
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,393
This is too easy.

327
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,473
I feel bad for putting her to sleep in the bathroom,

328
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:22,944
but I'll be going with this this time.

329
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:28,104
Heiji, have you seen my phone?

330
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,573
I haven't seen it in a while.

331
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,604
Want me to call it?

332
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:42,333
Oh, it's in the room with the ice.

333
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:46,173
I must've left it there after taking a picture of the ring.

334
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,244
Really?

335
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,463
But it's almost the time Kid gave.

336
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,513
You'll have to wait until it's over.

337
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:53,494
What?!

338
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:54,703
But if I don't have my phone,

339
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:57,253
I won't be able to take a picture of Kid if he shows up.

340
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:58,174
Yeah, but...

341
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,293
Please, Heiji.

342
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:03,683
Ask the Inspector to let us go get it.

343
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,273
You're ridiculous.

344
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:06,504
What?

345
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,354
Can't we?

346
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,354
Heiji.

347
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:15,604
Y-You're hopeless...

348
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:17,404
What?

349
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:20,243
Let you go get your phone?

350
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,034
Yeah.

351
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:23,273
We've still got ten minutes.

352
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:24,673
We'll be quick.

353
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,053
You're hopeless.

354
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,034
Thanks.

355
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:28,733
We're running out of time.

356
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,213
Be quick about it.

357
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,284
Got it.

358
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:32,414
Let's see...

359
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:36,164
Oh, it's over here.

360
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,564
He covered the ice with a clear sheet?

361
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,394
H-Hey!

362
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,314
What's this smoke?

363
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:54,854
What?

364
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:56,863
Hey, what's going on?

365
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:57,734
Hey!

366
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,883
He appears to have detonated some smoke bombs

367
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,803
and sprayed an ink-like liquid in the air.

368
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,564
Damn!

369
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,154
We can't see what's happening inside!

370
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:10,413
Is that the sound of a drill?

371
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,664
Is he planning to drill a hole in the ice and steal it?

372
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:17,294
You'd throw something at the mouse if not for the pot.

373
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,424
What?

374
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,924
Just as you can't throw something at a mouse to kill it

375
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,674
because you're worried about breaking the container beside it,

376
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,684
Kid shouldn't be able to steal the ring even if he wants to.

377
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:32,304
This sound is a bluff.

378
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,064
Let's wait for the door to open.

379
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,804
Is that really true?

380
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:42,944
Three, two, one, zero!

381
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,284
Both of you, don't move!

382
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:46,633
Huh?

383
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:48,534
What's this black sheet?

384
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:49,923
I see.

385
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:52,784
The ink stained the sheet that came down from the ceiling black.

386
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:03,743
Wh-What is this?

387
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:05,924
There's tons of rings inside the ice!

388
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:08,483
B-But how?

389
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:10,533
It really is magic.

390
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,434
W-Wait a minute.

391
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,314
There's a long hole in the middle of the block,

392
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:19,353
and the ring is missing!

393
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:22,854
The fairy's lips are mine Kaito Kid

394
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:45,314
"The fairy's lips are mine."

395
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,484
Kaito Kid!

396
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:55,744
Looks like I'll have to cover that ridiculous mouth in order to keep you quiet.

397
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,243
Kazuha-chan's being so bold.

398
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:01,084
Do you know anyone in Tokyo?

399
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:06,834
Where are they now and what are they doing?

400
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:12,414
The next episode of Conan is "Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips, Part Two!"
