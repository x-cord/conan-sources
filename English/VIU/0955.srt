00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:35,513
Excuse me, Genta.

2
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:38,013
I've been wondering...

3
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,213
What?

4
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:40,613
Those clothes appear to be

5
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:45,014
a traditional insect hunting outfit, but...

6
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:50,513
What are you trying to catch with that giant net?

7
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:52,514
I wanna know too.

8
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,813
You guys wanna know?

9
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:58,313
Well...

10
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:01,013
-Well? -Well?

11
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:02,613

00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:08,813
Welcome!

15
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:10,513
Seriously?

16
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:14,013
So you're trying to catch...

17
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:17,313
That's right. I'm going insect man hunting.

18
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:19,514

What was that?

21
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,714
That was kind of a creepy sound.

22
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:38,513
That's the cry of an insect man!

23
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,114
What?

24
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,513
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

An insect man suddenly appears?

00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,413
A secret world in a mountain village.

28
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,913
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,613
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,814

Is the insect man ranch?

40
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:09,382
It's kinda scary.

41
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,383
Let's go.

42
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,182
-Yeah! -Okay!

43
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,783
Geez.

It's the same as before...

00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:35,182
-The cry of the insect man! -The cry of the insect man!

That's too bad.

Of course.

Excuse us.

57
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:11,783
Welcome.

00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,182
I'm Koichi Kabuto, 13 years old.

This is my younger brother, Koji Kabuto.

-I see... -I see.

62
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,182
That's kind of you. Thank you very much.

63
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:27,982
So...

64
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:30,582
I know...

65
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,482
You're wondering why we're dressed like this.

66
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:37,282
And why the adults of the village are doing construction work

67
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,482
at the village shrine.

68
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,982
-Yeah. -Yeah.

69
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,882
It's too much trouble to explain it all,

70
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:46,182
so let me perform it for you in a picture-story show.

71
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,982
-A picture-story show? -A picture-story show?

72
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:49,683
Isn't that kind of a lot of trouble too?

73
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:57,783
"An Accurate History of the Village Operated Insect Man Ranch Incident."

74
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,682
Once upon a time, about one year ago,

75
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:10,282
an important Japanese government official came to this village.

76
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:14,782
He said, "I shall build a casino and public bath

77
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,082
in the forest surrounding this village."

78
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,782
The adults of the village were overjoyed.

79
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:23,082
But the village mayor was strongly opposed.

80
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,182
He opposed the idea because in the forest

81
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,382
was the grave of Princess Gaga,

82
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:32,283
who loved all insects in the world.

83
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,482
However, the important Japanese government official

84
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,382
ignored the village mayor's protests

85
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:44,182
and went to inspect the forest.

86
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,683
And then...

87
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,282
He fell victim to Princess Gaga's curse

88
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:52,683
and was attacked by a giant moth!

89
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,982
The frightened official fled

90
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,082
and the plans to construct the casino

91
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,482
and public bath were put on hold.

92
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:07,682
The village mayor decided to build an insect man ranch instead.

93
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,982
The insect man ranch is an amusement park

94
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:14,282
where children dress in insect costumes.

95
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:19,282
The village mayor paid for these costumes out of his own pocket.

96
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:20,682
-I see. -I see.

97
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:24,182
When the children heard the news, they were overjoyed.

98
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,982
But the adults of the village were strongly opposed.

99
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:30,382
The village mayor decided to give up on his plan.

100
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,282
How sad.

101
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:36,582
But later, after retiring from being the village mayor,

102
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,082
he bought up the forest with his retirement pay,

103
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,582
put up "Do Not Enter" signs,

104
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,382
and began construction with bulldozers.

105
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,982
What? Isn't that where we just were?

106
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,282
Yes.

107
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:50,882
That's when...

108
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:54,382
the former mayor came to this restaurant.

109
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:58,782
"Kabutoya Restaurant" -The moment he ordered our famous katsu bowl,

110
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:03,082
the former mayor suddenly died.

111
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,582
-What? -What?

112
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,782
The story's moving too fast!

113
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:10,182
But this is a work of non-fiction.

114
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:12,582
It may be non-fiction, but...

115
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,583
-Right? -Right?

116
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,982
But then!

117
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,182
Unbelievably,

118
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,882
a map showing the location of Princess Gaga's treasure

119
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:20,882
was found in the former mayor's pocket.

120
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,982
We told you, you're moving too fast.

121
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:26,482
You need to establish more foreshadowing.

122
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,582
I can't follow the story.

123
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:33,882
The truth was, the former mayor was excavating the forest

124
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:36,682
so he could keep Princess Gaga's treasure all for himself.

125
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,282
Really?

126
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,482
When the adults of the village heard this,

127
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,582
they became obsessed with Princess Gaga's treasure

128
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,282
and they began excavating the forest.

129
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:49,882
Meanwhile, the children who the former mayor betrayed

130
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:53,082
were unable to give up on their dream of an insect man ranch,

131
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,982
so they wear insect costumes,

132
00:08:55,983 --> 00:09:00,782
while the adults remain obsessed with Princess Gaga's treasure,

133
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:03,182
do an admirable job

134
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,582
by looking after things in their absence, if I say so myself.

135
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,082
"The End" -And they lived happily ever after.

136
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,482
How?

137
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,782
There's nothing happily ever after about that.

138
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:16,082
Is that picture-story really true?

139
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,582
Yes, of course.

140
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,782
After all...

141
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:21,783
"Accurate History" -It's an accurate history.

142
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:26,382
I'm kind of hungry.

143
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,882
I know. Let's have some of the famous katsu bowls

144
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,582
that appeared in the picture-story.

145
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,582
-Yeah. -I want an eel bowl.

146
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,882
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,682
As you can see, there are no adults here.

148
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,482
That kind of dish is beyond what we can prepare.

149
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,382
What can you serve, then?

150
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,682
We can boil instant ramen.

151
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:50,882
Free of charge, of course.

152
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,982
Fine, then. I'll have ramen, then.

153
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:56,582
-Me too. -Me too.

154
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,782
What about you, Conan?

155
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,882
Huh? Oh.

156
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,082
I'm not hungry yet

157
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,083
so I'm going to go for a walk.

158
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,182
Then we'll have three ramens, please.

159
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:09,582
Coming right up!

160
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,583
That's three orders of ramen!

161
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:19,382
"Public bathroom with casino construction plans canceled."

162
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:22,682
"Mayor of Kuronosu Village retires."

163
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:26,082
Something's not right.

164
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,182
Did the mayor really say

165
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,882
he'd open an insect man ranch

166
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,982
so he could keep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?

167
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,382
Not only that, but he even paid for costumes

168
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:38,982
for the village's children out of his own pocket.

169
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,282
Then there's the cursed giant moth

170
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,183
that chased the government official away.

171
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:49,382
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

When you eat here,

173

you can rent an insect costume free of charge.

174
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,182
Would you like to do that?

175
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,582
Costumes?

176
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,282
Lending service?

177
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:03,183
Insect?

178
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,182
Costumes?

179
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,682
That's it. Maybe...

"Kuronosu Village Post Office."

181
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,283
Excuse me.

182
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:22,082
Excuse me!

183
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,182
"Mitsuo Seta (10)" -Huh? Oh, welcome.

184
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:29,382
I'd like to see a record of deliveries made to the late former mayor.

185
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:33,682
That should be in those records over there.

186
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,083
Thanks.

187
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,982
One year ago...

188
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:43,983
Found it.

189
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,682
"Kuronosu Village Mayor, Halloween Moth Costume" -I knew it.

190
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:49,882
In other words, the late former mayor

191
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,182
wore this moth costume

192
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:55,482
and waited for the officials to come inspect the forest.

193

"Chosuke Murano, Mayor."

194
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,282
Yes...

195
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,083
Moth!

196
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,583
It's the curse of Princess Gaga!

197
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:11,582
So the mayor was behind Princess Gaga's curse.

198
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,182
Was it really to keep her treasure to himself?

199
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,483
Excuse me.

200
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,483
What did you think of my cicada impression?

201
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,083
Nice.

202
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:33,183
"Kuronosu Village Post Office."

203
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,670
"Kabutoya Restaurant" -Thank you!

204
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,369
Dressing like this is kind of exciting.

205
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,469
-What? -Me too.

206
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,870
-Huh? -Dressing like this is kind of exciting.

207
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,769
In that case, me too.

208

Do you work at this clinic?

211
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,869
Yes.

Patient information is confidential.

I can't discuss it with you.

Of course not.

219

But...

220
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,269
I might accidentally mention something while examining you.

221
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,270
Besides, you're kind of cute.

222

"Chono Clinic" -What? It was cancer?

223
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,670
The former mayor died of cancer?

224
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,469
That's right. It was pretty advanced too.

225
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,869
I heard from Daddy that

226
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,669
he had only a year left by the time he retired.

227
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,269
Did he know?

228
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,270
Of course he knew.

229

You've got a lot of cholesterol in your brain from thinking too hard.

230
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,469
You'll need a shot.

231
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,570

232
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,369
Excuse me...

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,569
Genta and Ayumi.

234
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,569
I know you're excited about being insect people

235
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,069
but it's dangerous for us to enter an off-limits forest.

236
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,269
-Mantis! -Huh?

237
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,669
-Ladybug! -What?

238
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,869
-Yeah! -Yeah!

Wait for me!

241
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,869
The former mayor knew he didn't have long to live.

242
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,569
So why did he spend his retirement pay

243
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,569
to keep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?

244
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,969
He even distributed costumes to the children

245
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,469
and lied about opening an insect man ranch.

246
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,869
Wait a minute.

247
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,869
Does Princess Gaga's treasure even exist?

248

"Kuronosu Village Office."

249
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,770
Excuse me.

250
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,670
What happened?

251
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:19,169
Well, I put on this spider costume,

252
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,669
so I thought I'd practice making spiderwebs,

253
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,669
but then I slipped.

254
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,269
Help me.

255
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,669
Give me a second.

256
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,169
"Kuronosu Village Office" -Fly...

257
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,170
Mosquito.

258
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:32,069
-Fly. -Mosquito.

259
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,170
Fly...

260
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,269
Thank you for helping me.

261
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,069
I'm Morio Kusuda, 11 years old.

262
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,669
My father works at this village office.

263
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,269
Do you know if there's a book here on the village's history?

264
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,969
About that...

265
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,769
It's in bookshelf over there.

266
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,369
It contains the grade school teacher's research

267
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,369
on the village's history.

268
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,370
Found it.

269
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,170
"History of Kuronosu Village" -This is it.

270
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,470
-Did you find it? -Yeah.

271
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,669
According to legend,

272
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,369
the grave of the noble Princess Gaga

273
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,069
once existed in the forest surrounding the village.

274
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,270
It was a large keyhole-shaped tomb.

275
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,470
It's not here.

276
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:23,269
Huh? What's not there?

277
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,669
There's no mention of Princess Gaga's treasure.

278
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,969
Then why did the mayor buy up the forest?

279
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,169
What was the construction work for?

280
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,070
And then there's the treasure map the mayor had on him when he died.

281
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,969
Did you hear something?

282
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,769
I heard something coming from the village shrine.

283
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,170
Help, Conan!

284
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,669
I told you

285
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,369
it was dangerous to enter an off-limits forest!

286
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,069
But Mitsuhiko the dragonfly...

287
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,969
-What? -It's only natural for an insect person

288
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,969
to want to enter the forest.

289
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,869
Ayumi the ladybug is right.

290
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,269
Thank you, Genta the praying mantis.

291
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,169
Mitsuhiko the dragonfly, there's something wrong with you.

292
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,670
What?

293
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,070
Genta! Ayumi!

294
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,769
This is bad!

295
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,869
Wait...

296
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,469
Why are they wearing costumes?

297
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,369
You kids dressed as insect people

298
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,969
so you could steal Princess Gaga's treasure, didn't you?

299
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,569
No!

300
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,669
We just wanted to enjoy the forest as insect people.

301
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,669
Liar!

302
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,469
Where are you kids from?

303
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,169
Beika-cho.

304
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,969
The city? Then you can't be trusted!

305
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,070
-No! -You're perverts!

306
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,769
Genta the praying mantis.

307
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,769
What is it, Mitsuhiko the dragonfly?

308
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,469
I don't think that makes them perverts.

309
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,469
What are they, then?

310
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,069
Do you know, Ayumi the ladybug?

311
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,169
I think it's called pre...

312
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,869
Yes, it begins with pre...

313
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,869
-Pre? -Pre?

314
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,069
Prejudiced.

315
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,869
Yes, that's it!

316
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,969
Conan!

317
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,269
You idiots!

318
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,069
There's another one! Get him!

319
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,670
Guys, run!

320
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,070
Don't let them escape!

321
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,270
This way!

322
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,169
Come down from there!

323
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,969
Or do you want us to drag you down?

324
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,369
What should we do?

325
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,869
Conan?

326
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,069
Hey.

327
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,469
What should we do?

328
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,169
We can't escape.

329
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,669
I see. So that's how it is.

330
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,769
Everyone, calm down and listen to me!

331
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,769
Princess Gaga's treasure doesn't exist!

332
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,069
-Impossible! -Don't lie to us!

333
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,569
To prove it,

334
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,869
there's no mention of the treasure

335
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,469
in the village's historical documents!

336
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,569
Then why did the mayor buy up the forest?

337
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,669
To make an insect man ranch.

338
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,670
What?

339
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:50,969
The mayor tried to build the insect man ranch

340
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,269
that you all opposed by himself.

341
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,169
But then he learned he wouldn't live to see its completion

342
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,670
because he had cancer.

343
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,969
So the mayor came up with a plan.

344
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,469
He spread the rumor that he was trying to keep

345
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,369
Princess Gaga's non-existent treasure to himself

346
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,269
and made sure the fake treasure map

347
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,069
would be discovered after his death.

348
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,669
Were there detailed excavation instructions written on the map?

349
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,469
Yeah, almost obnoxiously detailed.

350
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,869
And that's the result of following those obnoxiously detailed

351
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,170
excavation instructions.

352
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,969
The mayor didn't just leave behind the treasure map

353
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,369
and excavation instructions.

354
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,569
That's the tomb of Princess Gaga,

355
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,869
who loved all insects.

356
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,569
They were plans to build a keyhole-shaped tomb.

357
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,069
He probably left it up to you to fulfill his dream

358
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,570
of building an insect man ranch.

359
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,069
"Chono Clinic."

360
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,369
"Kuronosu Village Post Office."

361
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,369
"Kabuto Restaurant."

362
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,370
"Kuronosu Village Office."

363
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,469
The train sure is late.

364
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,169
Yeah.

365
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,969
Anyway, Genta...

366
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,470
That outfit...

367
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,169
Just how much do you like it?

368
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,569
Doesn't it seem strange for an insect man

369
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,269
to be carrying a bug catching net?

370
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,569
No.

371
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,969
It's very strange.

372
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,269
There's nothing strange about it. After all...

373
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,969
-After all... -After all...

374
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,969
After all, insect men...

375
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,270
-Insect men... -Insect men...

376
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,169
Insect men go people hunting!

377
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,770
-What? -What?

378
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,669
"Next Episode."

379
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,369
It seems the victim Eiji Kadowaki

380
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,569
was abusing his mother Yasuko daily.

381
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,869
There's no domestic violence in our family!

382
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,269
That's just an irresponsible rumor!

383
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,370
What? Their son was killed?

384
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,870
But I didn't do it!

385
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,770
