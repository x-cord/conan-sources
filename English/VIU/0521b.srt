1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:03,089
A crisis is gracefully revived.

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:05,089
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,289
Shinichi loses his memory and is not himself.

4
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:09,389
He cannot deduce the case together with Heiji.

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,089
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,989
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,089
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,074
That stuff is just fairy tale.

9
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,774
True. The story about Death

10
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:59,874
is a story of the god of the district who protects the land

11
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:02,174
from those who dare mess around with it.

12
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:05,574
A folklore that is often heard of in rural areas.

13
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:09,874
That is until a young woman died in this lake...

14
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,074
9 years ago.

15
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:14,574
Oh no.

16
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:17,474
You mean something's really inside this forest?

17
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,974
Yes.

18
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:22,274
At sundown of the 3rd day

19
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,074
after the villagers went all out searching

20
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:26,074
for the young woman that never came back from the forest.

21
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:30,074
A rumor started going around among the tired villagers

22
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:32,774
that she'd been punished for breaking the rule

23
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,474
that had been set from ancient times

24
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:38,974
by entering the forest at night and angered Death,

25
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,474
the guardian of the forest.

26
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:45,774
The father of the young lady who heard this rumor

27
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,974
ignored all those who tried to stop him,

28
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:51,174
went into the forest just around sundown

29
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:53,874
to look for her and never came back.

30
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,874
It was two days later

31
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:59,974
that the people found the corpse of the young lady

32
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:03,074
who had slipped into the lake and drowned.

33
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,874
If I'm not mistaken her name was...

34
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,374
Tamako Okuda.

35
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,174
Okuda?

36
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,474
Right.

37
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:12,574
She was the younger sister of Makoto Okuda

38
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,774
who you said sent you a letter.

39
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,374
Then, the father who you mentioned

40
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,874
went into the forest to search for her was...

41
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,874
Yes. Makoto's father.

42
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,874
He hasn't been found to this day.

43
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:27,674
Maybe Makoto's father was also fell prey to Death.

44
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:31,274
But I wonder if it's credible to conclude

45
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,274
that an imaginary figure committed the crime,

46
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,374
just by the information that we have now.

47
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,474
I didn't believe the story at first either.

48
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,174
But...

49
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,974
I saw it.

50
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:44,474
I saw the white haired monster hiding on top of a tree

51
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,274
inside the crimson forest at sundown,

52
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,074
with its teeth showing and sneering.

53
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,374
What?

54
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:56,674
Maybe you mistook a monkey or something for it.

55
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:58,674
It wasn't a monkey.

56
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:01,274
A person from the town office said that he saw it just last week.

57
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,374
But, it's strange?

58
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:08,874
Why would the village and his wife be killed by that monster?

59
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,974
Did he go into the forest at night?

60
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,974
The redevelopment of the village.

61
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,374
Mr. Hinohara was planning to build

62
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:18,874
a large tourist facility in the forest.

63
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,274
I see.

64
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:23,274
That's why he angered Death.

65
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:27,074
Yes, therefore, the plan went down the drain.

66
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:30,174
As for the hero of this village, Hinohara,

67
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:32,574
all he was trying to do was do something

68
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,174
about the rural exodus that was occurring in this village.

69
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,474
Hero?

70
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,974
You don't know?

71
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:39,474
During his younger days,

72
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,174
he was a track runner nominated as candidate

73
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:44,874
for track in the Olympics representing Japan.

74
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,974
I forgot what exactly he competed in.

75
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:50,774
But, if you'd like to, do you want to go and see

76
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,974
upstairs to his room on the 2nd floor?

77
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:56,574
Really.

78
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:59,474
He seems to have competed in many contests.

79
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:02,274
It doesn't say what contest it was.

80
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,274
How come only the medals are here?

81
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,374
I wonder if he took all the strings off?

82
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:12,074
It's the statue of the Deva Kings.

83
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,174
Let's see.

84
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:15,774
It's pretty heavy.

85
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,174
It's exquisitely well made.

86
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:21,874
But why is there only one?

87
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:25,374
The Deva Kings are a pair of two wrath-filled

88
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,274
and muscular guardians of the Buddha.

89
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,974
Since that's the Unzo with its mouth closed,

90
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:33,774
there would usually be an Azo with its mouth open too, right?

91
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,074
The Azo of the Nioh statue,

92
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:37,774
on the night the incident occurred,

93
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:42,274
disappeared from this house together with the jewelry of Mrs. Hinohara.

94
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,474
I see. The culprit stole it?

95
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,474
Is this expensive?

96
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:50,974
Yes, it's the masterpiece of a famous wood carver of the Edo Era,

97
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:54,274
and at present its probably no less than 5 million yen.

98
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:56,474
Five... five million?

99
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,974
Hold it. Isn't it funny?

100
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:01,674
Why'd the culprit take only one of it?

101
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,174
It's worth more if they're a pair, right?

102
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,274
I wonder...

103
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:08,774
That seems to have bothered Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

104
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:14,774
who came here a year ago too.

105
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:19,074
Kudo, can't you remember anything yet?

106
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,374
Kudo.

107
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,074
Ran.

108
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,674
-Where? -Over this way.

109
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,674
Come over to this room over here.

110
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,374
You'd be surprised.

111
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,374
Shinichi's picture?

112
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:44,374
This is a picture of when Shinichi first did an interview for a magazine.

113
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,074
How nostalgic.

114
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,074
It's been enlarged.

115
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:51,174
It sure is big.

116
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:56,074
All the cases that Shinichi solved are filed.

117
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,174
Whose room is this?

118
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,374
It's Makoto's room.

119
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:05,174
Makoto worshipped this high school detective you see,

120
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,674
that's why when he heard that Shinichi Kudo

121
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:08,774
was going to come help solve the case,

122
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,074
Makoto was really happy

123
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:14,374
saying that he was sure Shinichi would solve the case.

124
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,774
But, the conclusion he came to was that,

125
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:19,374
the village head committed a double suicide.

126
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:22,474
Makoto was really depressed too

127
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,974
because he lost his mother

128
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:25,374
who fell sick when he was little.

129
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,374
And now Mr. Hinohara who adopted him as his son,

130
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:31,574
when he thought that he'd be alone for life was.

131
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,674
They were a typical blood type O family.

132
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,974
He told me that Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

133
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,374
as well as their son, Daiki were all very pleasant,

134
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:42,074
so he felt very comfortable and that he couldn't be happier.

135
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,874
So, it's hard to believe

136
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,774
that the village head would do anything to hurt his wife.

137
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,774
But, I told myself over and over again

138
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:52,374
that I had no choice but to accept it

139
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:55,874
because Makoto believed that you're a renown detective.

140
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:59,974
But it turns out that the truth of the case

141
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,774
is not what that renown detective concluded.

142
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,274
The detective was wrong

143
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:06,174
when he said that the Mr. Hinohara

144
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:09,674
was told by the doctor that he had cancer

145
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:12,274
and committed double suicide in despair.

146
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,474
Right. Makoto tried to get in touch you

147
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,074
by writing letters and calling you repeatedly,

148
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,174
but he was disappointed because he couldn't get a hold of you at all.

149
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,774
He said that he even personally went to see you

150
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,674
to ask you to reinvestigate the case, but you weren't in.

151
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,074
Well, yes...

152
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,074
Because he shrunk and wasn't at home.

153
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,374
But, only now you come

154
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:32,174
and have amnesia to make things worse?

155
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,574
You got to be kidding.

156
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,974
I want to be alone.

157
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:41,674
Would you please let me stay in this room alone for a while?

158
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,274
I feel as if I can maybe remember something.

159
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,174
Okay.

160
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,374
Well leave you alone for a while then.

161
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:54,374
Take your time and try to remember, okay?

162
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:07,574
Which means that the village head's son, Daiki

163
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:10,774
is staying with you Mr. Shiroyama?

164
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:14,374
Yes, Makoto was doing likewise till six months ago too.

165
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:17,874
You know, it's been bothering me from a while ago but...

166
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,074
Why is his name still Makoto Okuda?

167
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:22,774
If he was adopted by Mr. Hinohara,

168
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,074
wouldn't his name have been changed to Makoto Hinohara?

169
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:28,674
Yes. That's what's written on the family register.

170
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:30,774
But, he felt that it would be too audacious for him

171
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:32,574
to take after the village heads name,

172
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,774
so he used to go by his previous last name, Okuda.

173
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,374
Shinichi's come out.

174
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:40,974
And were you able to remember something?

175
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,874
Well, no need to be depressed.

176
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:49,874
I'm sure that you'll regain your memory in time.

177
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:59,274
I was wondering what kind of trick you had up sleeve,

178
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:02,274
but I guess you haven't come up with anything yet.

179
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:03,374
Trick?

180
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:04,474
Yes.

181
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:09,274
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

182
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,974
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

183
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:15,174
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

184
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,474
Well, if you decide to give in and confess to everything,

185
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:24,174
come to the Kotoh Inn where I'm staying.

186
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,274
If you do,

187
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,574
I'll write a very nice article about you in the papers

188
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:32,274
about the truth that you're trying to hide

189
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:35,674
the fact that you cannot speak of.

190
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,674
Don't tell anyone, all right.

191
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:48,074
A truth that he cannot speak of.

192
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:53,674
Gee, that newspaper reporter lady wasn't very likable.

193
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:56,574
What did she mean by know what Shinichi is up to?

194
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,774
Well, what we know for now is...

195
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:02,474
that this detective kid made a mistake deducing this case

196
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,774
which can be none other than armed robbery case

197
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,374
as forced double suicide,

198
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,074
as well as totally mistaking the motive for murder.

199
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,774
And one more thing.

200
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,374
Within this forest,

201
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:17,774
an unidentifiable creature or something is still here hiding.

202
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,774
Kazuha.

203
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,374
What if...

204
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,074
Just what if... This is just what if okay?

205
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,474
Yes.

206
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:29,174
The person you've been wanting to see and love

207
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:31,574
suddenly appears in front of you

208
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,674
and turns out to be amnesic.

209
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:35,774
What would you do, Kazuha?

210
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,974
Well...

211
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,774
I'd just break down and cry.

212
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:43,874
I'd be so happy to see him

213
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,474
and at the same time be so sad that he had forgotten all about me.

214
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:49,074
I'd be overwhelmed with emotion.

215
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,074
If you can't feel this way,

216
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:53,774
I'd say you don't love that person.

217
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,174
He'd be no more than a friend.

218
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,974
I thought so too.

219
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:58,974
No, no.

220
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,474
I was just talking about stupid me just now.

221
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:04,074
I don't feel a thing.

222
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,174
Only...

223
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:10,774
All I feel is that Shinichi has gone far away.

224
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,274
Don't worry.

225
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:16,274
Once he regains his memory, everything will return to normal.

226
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,374
Yes.

227
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:23,574
I wonder what's gotten into me?

228
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,574
Oh no. Rain.

229
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,174
This is bad.

230
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,474
Let's run to the inn.

231
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:35,874
Hurry, hurry.

232
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,974
"Okuho Inn" -What? Shinichi is not in the room?

233
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,574
Yes, when I got up in the morning

234
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,174
his side of the bed was empty.

235
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:53,574
Oh, no.

236
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,974
Hey.

237
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,174
I asked a villager just now

238
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:58,974
and he told me he saw Shinichi go into Mr. Hinohara's residence

239
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:00,874
early in the morning.

240
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:06,074
Don't tell me that he got his memory back?

241
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,274
Hey, Kudo!

242
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,974
Kudo's shoes and a woman's shoes?

243
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,774
Are you in there, Kudo?

244
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:23,774
There he is.

245
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,774
You got your memory back, right?

246
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:30,274
That's why you came here, right, Kudo?

247
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,574
Blood?

248
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:36,974
What's up?

249
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,974
You're bleeding profusely.

250
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:49,355
Hey, Kudo.

251
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,655
What's going on?

252
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,255
What happened?

253
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:54,855
I don't know.

254
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,055
My mind just went blank.

255
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,455
When I snapped back to myself, I was here.

256
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,355
Did I do it?

257
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,955
Did I... kill her?

258
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,155
She's still alive.

259
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:18,155
So you were here after all, detective kid.

260
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,055
Isn't she the newspaper reporter?

261
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,755
What happened?

262
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,555
She's bleeding badly.

263
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,155
Explain later.

264
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,055
Hurry call an ambulance and the police.

265
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:35,455
No, all you need to call is the ambulance.

266
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,055
Why?

267
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,855
Somebody did this to her, right?

268
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,855
How can you be so dense?

269
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,455
If we call the police with things the way they are,

270
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,155
the police will deem Shinichi the culprit.

271
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,755
Oh no...

272
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,255
Don't tell me that you...

273
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:53,955
Idiot. Kudo would never stab anyone.

274
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,555
This is a trap.

275
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,655
Somebody set it up to look as if Kudo did it.

276
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:03,755
After all there seems to be many who hate Kudo in this village.

277
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:07,955
Besides, if Kudo's taken to the police now...

278
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,055
No matter if he's innocent,

279
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,355
he'll have to be interrogated for a long period of time.

280
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:15,355
If the drug that will return his body back to a child's takes effect,

281
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,255
it'll be more than I can handle.

282
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:19,255
Call the ambulance, Kazuha.

283
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:22,755
Pops, bring the car here and hide Kudo, will you?

284
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,755
Okay.

285
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,955
Yes.

286
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:28,455
That's the siren of an ambulance...

287
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,455
There are the sounds of police cars too.

288
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,055
It's getting closer.

289
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:34,555
Who called them?

290
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,055
I see.

291
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,955
You had doubts about a solved murder case

292
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,855
that occurred here a year ago,

293
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,455
despite having come here last night,

294
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,655
came back here again and found

295
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:55,255
newspaper reporter Ms. Misato Kawauchi,

296
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:59,255
stabbed in the stomach and lying here.

297
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:01,955
Yes, Detective Kogoro Mouri?

298
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,555
Yes, well I guess.

299
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:08,455
And when you came, are you sure that no one else

300
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,055
other than the victim was here?

301
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,555
Yes. Right?

302
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,555
Yes.

303
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,855
Well, the murder weapon is here,

304
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,455
so if we conduct investigation of the hardware at the entrance,

305
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:21,155
well probably come up with the culprit right away.

306
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:22,355
Hardware?

307
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,355
In police jargon, it means footprints.

308
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:29,555
But, how can you figure it out?

309
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,255
The ground is muddy from the rain all night yesterday,

310
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,055
so shoe prints are left on the ground.

311
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:36,355
The prints of the victim

312
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,955
and the culprit are left clear on the ground.

313
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:42,655
But, officer. They could be our shoe prints.

314
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,355
No. You all came here after the sun rose

315
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:48,455
and the ground more or less dried,

316
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,155
so your shoe prints are shallow.

317
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,655
We already matched your prints with those of your shoes at the entrance,

318
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,055
so there's no doubt.

319
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,055
What bothers me are the shoes prints of the culprit

320
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,055
who came here at the break of day when the ground while still wet.

321
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:03,355
Why did the culprit go outside from the backdoor of this house

322
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,555
after the ground dried?

323
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:08,955
Moreover, the number of people who came here

324
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:11,455
after the ground dried is supposed to be four,

325
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,555
but there are only three here.

326
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:16,355
What's more, the owner of the fourth shoes print also went outside

327
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:19,255
for some reason from the backdoor.

328
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:23,655
I wonder if you, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro can solve this mystery?

329
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:25,055
Oh, well...

330
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:26,755
I can't say anything yet.

331
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,955
Listen, Kudo.

332
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,255
I know it's sort of cramped in there,

333
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,655
but hang in there, okay?

334
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:32,455
Hold up for a while

335
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,755
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

336
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,355
The effect of the drug according to the little lady will keep

337
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,755
keep for 24 hours.

338
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:46,655
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

339
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:51,155
Heiji.

340
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,655
I can't take lying any longer.

341
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,755
She's right, Heiji.

342
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,555
I think we should tell the truth

343
00:17:57,555 --> 00:17:59,955
and cooperate with the police in their investigation.

344
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,955
It's easy for them to say because they don't know anything.

345
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,955
Well, the situation looks really bad, though.

346
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,355
It seems that today the people who went to that house

347
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,155
before the police came, were we four,

348
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,855
the victim, Mrs. Kawauchi

349
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:16,855
and that detective kid, but no one else.

350
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:18,355
Is that true?

351
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:19,555
Yes.

352
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:22,155
The surroundings of the house was investigated with great care,

353
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:25,855
but only the shoes prints of the six, were found, I heard.

354
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,355
Shinichi's shoes are those that you bought for him

355
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,755
at the store of this village.

356
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,455
No matter how much we try to hide Shinichi,

357
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,455
I'm sure they'll find him right away.

358
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,455
A trick.

359
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:39,255
Somebody summoned the two,

360
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:41,855
drugged Shinichi putting him to sleep

361
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:42,955
wore his clothes

362
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,955
and stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi in the stomach.

363
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:47,055
But, if so...

364
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:51,855
That somebody's shoes prints should be left here, shouldn't it?

365
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,955
That's why I'm saying a tricks been used.

366
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:57,755
There's got to be a way.

367
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,255
Wait a second.

368
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,355
The house should've been locked.

369
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:03,955
How'd the culprit make it inside?

370
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:07,655
Neither Kudo nor Mrs. Kawauchi have the key to the house, do they?

371
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:09,055
Right.

372
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,255
When we went there last night

373
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:13,455
the police officer called Mr. Shiroyama opened the door for us.

374
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,455
That's right.

375
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:17,355
Why'd that police officer have the key to the house?

376
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,855
I got it from Daiki.

377
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:26,055
Did anybody besides you have the key to the house?

378
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:28,555
I have the keys that the head of the house

379
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:31,355
and his wife had also.

380
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:35,555
If anyone else were to have the key,

381
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:39,055
it would be their foster son, Makoto.

382
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,555
But, his whereabouts are unknown.

383
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,255
Now that you mentioned it...

384
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,955
During the time that Makoto left for the city

385
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,855
to take his university exam,

386
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:51,455
they key was temporarily given to his classmate, Ms. Hikawa,

387
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:55,255
so she could help around the house.

388
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,455
If I remember correctly,

389
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:02,155
on the day of Makoto's university exam is when the incident occurred.

390
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:03,555
Yes.

391
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:07,555
If so, that young lady called Hikawa may be a suspect.

392
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,855
Well, if she had the key,

393
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,155
she could've made a spare.

394
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:13,555
Maybe that young lady's the one responsible

395
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:16,455
for the incident a year ago, that Kudo deduced wrongly,

396
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:19,655
as well as for the incident that occurred this morning.

397
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:22,155
What did he deduce wrongly?

398
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,155
It's true that the house was totally messed up.

399
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,855
But it could have been that just as Shinichi said

400
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:29,655
Mr. Hinohara killed his wife and after that messed the room up

401
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:33,855
to make it look like it was armed robbery.

402
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,755
Idiot. It seems that when the incident happened a year ago,

403
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:39,555
the ground was also muddy from rain,

404
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:42,555
but the only thing they found around the house

405
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:45,655
were the shoe prints of one person going to the road

406
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,455
from the backdoor and back.

407
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,655
The culprit also walked around inside the house wearing shoes.

408
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:54,355
If Mr. Hinohara wanted to make it look like armed robbery,

409
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,955
and went outside with those shoes on,

410
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,355
then came back to the house again,

411
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:02,055
those shoes should be somewhere in the house, right?

412
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,355
True.

413
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:06,055
If he threw his shoes out of the house

414
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,555
the police are sure to have found them already, right?

415
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:12,755
The house of the veranda is about 30 m from the lake,

416
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,855
so there's no way the shoes would've made it inside.

417
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:19,155
But, I'm sure that Shinichi knew of that too, no?

418
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:23,855
Yes. That's why I've been thinking all night from last night...

419
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,055
No, wrong.

420
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,755
Even if we were to assume that the culprit who had the key

421
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:28,455
was ambushing them inside.

422
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:32,555
Unless you can find a way to go in and out of the house

423
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,455
without leaving shoes prints behind,

424
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,755
the murder would be impossible to commit.

425
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,055
An impossible crime.

426
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,555
Impossible crime.

427
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:44,255
A mysterious murder trick, but...

428
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:46,855
Shinichi would...

429
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,555
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

430
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:51,755
Darn.

431
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:52,955
If Shinichi were his usual self,

432
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:54,855
we would've been able to think it out together

433
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,655
and solve it in no time.

434
00:21:56,655 --> 00:22:00,255
Maybe we've got to go see Death after all.

435
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,555
Why Death?

436
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,955
Because the villager said yesterday, remember.

437
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:09,855
That he lost his memory after seeing Death in the forest.

438
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:11,055
And, last night

439
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:12,355
before going to bed

440
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:14,355
I heard from the clerk at the inn together with Ran

441
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:16,655
on what to do if Death's curse fell upon a person.

442
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:21,155
The clerk told us to go into the forest while the sun is still high.

443
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:28,855
When you see Death shout with all your might and call him.

444
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,655
And continue to pray with a heart that isn't tarnished.

445
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,455
Then, the curse will be lifted.

446
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:37,055
That is what's being said in this village.

447
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,755
But, there's virtually no one who actually tried it.

448
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:45,855
But, the clerk told us that the newspaper reporter lady did it.

449
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,155
Is that for real?

450
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:50,255
Yes. The clerk said that her daughter that she brought along with her

451
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:52,355
when she came to interview the people about the incident a year ago,

452
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:56,355
her daughter went into the forest and never came back so.

453
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:57,855
Hey.

454
00:22:57,855 --> 00:22:59,155
Ran's not here.

455
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:00,455
What?

456
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:02,955
Don't tell me that she took that story seriously

457
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:05,555
and went into the forest?

458
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:14,855
Death...

459
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,755
Death.

460
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:17,855
Please.

461
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,755
Return Shinichi back to normal.

462
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:23,155
If you don't mind my tarnished heart and all,

463
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:25,055
I'll give it to you.

464
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,955
That's why please return Shinichi

465
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,955
back to the real Shinichi.

466
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:34,155
Please, Death.

467
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:50,455
There... there he is.

468
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:53,555
He's really there.

469
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,255
Wait...

470
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:01,255
No good. I'm so scared that I've lost my voice.

471
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:11,355
Hey, wasn't that...

472
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:13,255
Wasn't that Ran's voice?

473
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,855
Something must've happened.

474
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:18,455
-Ran! -Ran...

475
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:20,355
-Where are you? -Ran!

476
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,055
No good.

477
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:28,555
My whole body hurts and I can't move.

478
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:32,255
What am I doing anyway?

479
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:34,455
I come into the forest of my own initiative,

480
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:37,855
then fall on my own.

481
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:39,355
How stupid can I get.

482
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,755
Death.

483
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:04,155
Please... please return Shinichi...

484
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:05,955
Please return Shinichi to normal.

485
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,155
This place is filled with pictures

486
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:50,255
and articles of that detective kid.

487
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:52,655
It's treated.

488
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:54,355
Who could've done this?

489
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,255
Splattered blood of the victim on his clothes,

490
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:58,055
fingerprints on the murder weapon...

491
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:01,255
No matter how you look at it, he's the murderer, but...

492
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,955
That's true.

493
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,855
Because he's the killer.

494
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:11,289
Next Conan's Hint:

495
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,989
