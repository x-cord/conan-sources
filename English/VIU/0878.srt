1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:02,177
Waves.

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:08,776
When I see the rear view of Sera running off,

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:11,577
I always hear it in the back of my mind.

4
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,076
The sound of the waves.

5
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,377
As if a spell has been cast over me.

6
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:25,077
I got homesick for Japan and returned.

7
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:31,177
In order to meet again with the magician.

8
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:35,377
Postscript?

9
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:40,277
"P.S. Have you already meet your magician?"

10
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,177
I guess.

11
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,477
Magician?

12
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:52,176
The magician is not me.

13
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,277
What?

14
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:57,477
You're the magician.

15
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:03,276
Listen.

16
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:06,777
Sera, have you by chance met me before?

17
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:12,176
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

18
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:14,676
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

19
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,676
Including the mysterious Sera,

20
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,776
the high school girls trio show off their swimsuits.

21
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,576
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:22,576
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:25,077
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:10,369
"Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 1)"

25
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,569
How is it?

26
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:37,869
Well...

27
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,268
Looks good, right?

28
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,269
It'll melt Shinichi's heart, Mrs. Kudo.

29
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,968
I already have.

30
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:52,269
We didn't invite Shinichi to the pool.

31
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,569
Then, it's your turn next, Sonoko!

32
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:04,268
How about it?

33
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,668
It's sexy and looks good, right?

34
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,669
It does, doesn't it?

35
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,268
But maybe if Kyogoku sees it, he may nags at you.

36
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,968
"Sonoko. Women should keep their hips warm."

37
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:17,969
like so!

38
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,368
You're right.

39
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:23,669
Because he's a typical Japanese man!

40
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,168
Then, it's my turn next!

41
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,969
Watch closely now.

42
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,169
What was that about?

43
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,068
Good, good!

44
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,969
It's sporty and cute!

45
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,768
When I was little, I used to wear swimsuits like these a lot.

46
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:55,568
I was actually attracted by the ones called micro bikinis too but...

47
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,668
-I don't think you should get that. -I don't think you should get that.

48
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,169
You think?

49
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,968
If you wear something like that with your physique...

50
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,568
How rude.

51
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,768
I'm going to bloom into an attractive sexy woman soon.

52
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,568
That swimsuit looks familiar.

53
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,368
If she was wearing a swimsuits,

54
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:13,969
it means I've seen it at a pool or the beach.

55
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,868
I'm scared.

56
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,369
It's like I'm possessed by something.

57
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:29,968
Who are you?

58
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,068
One possessed by Death.

59
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,769
You're a magician!

60
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,368
So, next, next!

61
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,168
Let's get with it!

62
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,969
What? You're still going to keep trying on?

63
00:05:58,569 --> 00:05:59,769
How is this?

64
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,169
I sort of feel like...

65
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,369
I don't belong here.

66
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:35,268
Hey!

67
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,768
May I go to the toy floor?

68
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,468
Sorry.

69
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,768
Conan, you're bored, aren't you?

70
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,968
Yeah.

71
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,468
You may but don't talk to strangers!

72
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:47,768
Okay.

73
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,268
I'll go pick you up after we buy our swimsuits,

74
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,668
so let's go eat at a restaurant, okay?

75
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,768
You must be starved, kid.

76
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:57,169
No, I'm already had my fill.

77
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,168
But I wonder what was that?

78
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,368
The memory I recalled a while ago.

79
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,468
You're a magician!

80
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,768
If that double tooth girl was Sera,

81
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:24,468
then that man wearing the sunglasses was...

82
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,668
Who are you?

83
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:30,068
He was really young but maybe he was Mr. Akai?

84
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,369
If so, who was that young boy and woman?

85
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,269
I feel like I've met them somewhere.

86
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,268
But, where was it?

87
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,768
Don't you remember?

88
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,068
It's me! Nitsuka!

89
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,068
I see...

90
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,168
I fainted in the fitting of this shop last week

91
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,868
"Tomoyo Nitsuka (43)" -and was taken to the medical office. Nitsuka!

92
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,668
Nitsuka.

93
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,968
"Reia Nanbu (24)" -I remember!

94
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,468
You're the one who fainted from anemia.

95
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,368
It wasn't anemia!

96
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,168
I'm allergic to dogs!

97
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,868
That woman who was covered with dog hair

98
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:10,268
was using the fitting room before me

99
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:13,668
so my body had allergic reaction, that's why I fainted.

100
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,068
I see.

101
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,969
That's why I'm asking you whether that woman is here today or not!

102
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,868
I have no idea what woman you are talking about.

103
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:28,768
Remember, the snobbish one with evil looking eyes and super flashy nails?

104
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,968
Gosh.

105
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,768
The woman that you're referring to as snobbish with evil looking eyes

106
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:39,469
and super flashy nails, could that by chance be me?

107
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,168
"Ritsuko Sashihara (41)" -Ms. Nitsuka, was it?

108
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,868
If you hate dog hair so much,

109
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,368
why don't you try on the clothes while holding your breath?

110
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,868
Right, Ms. Yamaki?

111
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,168
Don't you think so too?

112
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,068
Oh, but president.

113
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,468
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Dog allergy is a symptom that occurs

114
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,068
not only by inhaling dog hair

115
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,568
but also by touching dog hair, dandruff or saliva.

116
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,268
Is that so?

117
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,268
Which means that I can't try clothes on

118
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:12,268
unless I wear socks and wet suits.

119
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,668
Hey, you!

120
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,068
President.

121
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,368
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

122
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:21,868
What? How dare you voice your opinion at me?

123
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:22,968
What?

124
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,568
Have you forgotten that I took on your debts,

125
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,469
and even hired you to work at my company?

126
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:34,168
No. I haven't.

127
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,468
Well... there are three fitting rooms

128
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,768
so I think we can work things out

129
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,568
if you can agree on which room you'd like to use?

130
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:44,169
That sounds good.

131
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,068
Ms. Nanbu.

132
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,568
I don't recognize you.

133
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,768
Are you new here?

134
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,468
Yes! I was just assigned to this shop last month.

135
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,768
I know the owner.

136
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,368
I'll be sure to tell him about you.

137
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,768
Thank you!

138
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,068
That there's an eyesore at his shop who dared to tell me what to do,

139
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,868
so fire her immediately!

140
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,368
But...

141
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:14,168
Come on now, show me the clothes you recommend!

142
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,369
Because I've to attend a party overseas next week!

143
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,868
Come on! Hurry!

144
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:27,668
Unlike you, I don't have all the time in the world!

145
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,968
I don't know what's going on,

146
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,969
but I guess I'll let sleeping dogs lie.

147
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,168
You mean there are obnoxious women like her among the customers?

148
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,268
Yes.

149
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,768
That type of woman is the first to fall victim in mystery stories.

150
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,568
Come off it, Sera!

151
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,168
That's not nice!

152
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,068
What's the name of the shop?

153
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,268
It was a shop called Simusa on the fourth floor.

154
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,268
Hey, why don't we go there now?

155
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,269
What?

156
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,768
I want to take a look at that woman!

157
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,068
Forget it!

158
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,568
We all bought cute swimsuits and are in a good mood.

159
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:06,868
Swimsuits.

160
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,668
Sera.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,668
You know the first swimsuit that you tried on today...

162
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,768
That's right!

163
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,468
That swimsuit. Didn't you wear it somewhere else before?

164
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,968
It kind of looked familiar.

165
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,668
Really?

166
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,868
Come to think of it, maybe it was back then.

167
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:25,869
So, Ran saw it too.

168
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,369
Hey, look...

169
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,368
What's wrong, Sonoko?

170
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:38,868
The shop that the kid was talking about is near here.

171
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,168
Let's go see.

172
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,969
I said, forget it.

173
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:52,968
Hey, Conan!

174
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:54,668
A person's dead!

175
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:57,868
-Somebody call the police! -Somebody help!

176
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,369
That's the shop I just went to.

177
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:25,964
Hey, Conan!

178
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,764
A person's dead!

179
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:30,664
-Somebody call the police! -Somebody help!

180
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,565
That's the shop I just went to.

181
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,164
Did you call the police?

182
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,464
-Just now. -And don't let anyone who is at the shop leave!

183
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,464
Okay!

184
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,364
There is a Yoshikawa Line on her neck.

185
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,765
So, I'm pretty sure it's death by strangulation.

186
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:03,164
Her left hand is in her pocket.

187
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,265
Why?

188
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,964
She's pointing to the next room?

189
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,564
Who was in the fitting room left of her?

190
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,664
Me.

191
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,264
Don't tell me that you're the one who did it?

192
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:24,064
Stop joking, of course not!

193
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,864
Then, who was in the room to the right?

194
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:29,564
Me. Is there any problem with that?

195
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:33,064
Who was the first to find this?

196
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:35,464
That salesclerk.

197
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:39,365
Yes, the customer died in the fitting room.

198
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,965
She is holding something in her right hand too.

199
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,365
Lipstick?

200
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,164
Come to think of it,

201
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,364
there's a trace of lipstick being wiped off with a finger.

202
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:00,064
Before she was killed,

203
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:03,364
she put lipstick on her thumb and then grabbed it.

204
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,964
But, why?

205
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,465
What on earth was it for?

206
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:18,965
No way.

207
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:23,164
The one who died was the woman that Conan was just talking about?

208
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:27,265
Yes. The snobbish and obnoxious woman.

209
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,664
It's because Sera said that she would be the type to first victim

210
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:33,664
in mystery stories.

211
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:38,565
No, I think it's that kid who's summoning death.

212
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,364
And who's the victim?

213
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:43,864
Yes, sir.

214
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,964
She's Ms. Ritsuko Sashihara, 41 years old.

215
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:49,864
It seems like she's a president of a cosmetic company.

216
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:53,764
The cause of death was suffocation due to strangulation.

217
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,764
According to the forensic,

218
00:14:55,765 --> 00:15:00,264
the perp wrapped the rope around the victim's neck from behind

219
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,964
and pulled it by carrying her on the perp's back.

220
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,464
I see.

221
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,664
And who first discovered the body?

222
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,364
The first person to discover the body was...

223
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,764
Me!

224
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,764
And you are?

225
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,564
I'm a salesclerk here.

226
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,964
My name's Reia Nanbu.

227
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:22,464
Since Ms. Sashihara didn't come out of the fitting room for a while,

228
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:25,264
so I called out to her but got no answer,

229
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:28,064
when I opened the curtain and looked inside,

230
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,564
I found her like this.

231
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:34,164
And back then, who was using the fitting room on both sides?

232
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:37,664
I was in the room to the left.

233
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:42,264
Oh, I work for President Sashihara and my name is Yamaki.

234
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:46,065
When the president goes shopping, I usually accompany her.

235
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:49,664
I'll tell you because I know you're going to ask anyway.

236
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:53,164
I was in the fitting room to the right.

237
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,464
I'm Tomoyo Nitsuka!

238
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,664
Well, I'm just a customer

239
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:02,364
who has nothing to do with that woman who was killed, though!

240
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:05,364
Besides, it seems that this fitting room to the right

241
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,864
was being used by someone else before me.

242
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:12,164
Somebody? Did you see the person's face?

243
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:15,564
No. All I saw was the white sandals

244
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,464
that were in front of the fitting room!

245
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,964
I saw those sandals too!

246
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,464
I saw them too!

247
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:27,264
About how many customers were in the shop back then?

248
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:31,264
I think there were about four to five customers.

249
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,064
After hearing that someone was murdered,

250
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,864
they all left not wanting to be involved.

251
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:42,264
Although that boy told me not to let anyone leave.

252
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,364
Why are you here, Conan?

253
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:47,764
It's because I heard that salesclerk scream.

254
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:51,764
I was by the escalator near this shop back then.

255
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:54,064
Right, Sera?

256
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:57,664
Yeah. I heard about it from Conan that

257
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:00,064
the woman who was killed

258
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,364
and the three others here were having a bit of trouble

259
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,565
before the incident occurred.

260
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:13,264
But it's not good that the customers who were in the shop left.

261
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:18,264
Yes. The customer who was wearing those white sandals is of concern too.

262
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:20,264
Is there a security camera in the shop?

263
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,464
Yes, there is.

264
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:25,964
But I don't think there were any cameras around the fitting rooms.

265
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,164
I see.

266
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:32,464
That leaves us with the only clue being the two hands of the victim?

267
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:36,064
The thumb and the index finger of the left hand were erect.

268
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,564
She seems to have been holding her thumb

269
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,964
that she had lipstick on under the other fingers of her right hand.

270
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,564
What on earth is this?

271
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,065
Can't you figure it out?

272
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,464
That's a dying message!

273
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,564
A message from the dead!

274
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,764
Well, it could be,

275
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,264
but it also could be that the perp left it behind deliberately.

276
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:58,164
See, take a good look at it again!

277
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,864
Both of her palms!

278
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,864
Both of her palms?

279
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,864
She's still got clear nail marks on both her hands, right?

280
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:11,464
If it was the perp who made her grab a fist,

281
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,364
these marks wouldn't have been left behind like this.

282
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,964
The victim grabbed a fist with all her might as she was being strangled,

283
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:21,164
In order to tell everyone who killed her!

284
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,264
I see.

285
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:23,764
If so, in which direction was her left hand facing

286
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:26,764
at the time her body was found?

287
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:29,464
Her hand was inside the right pocket,

288
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,864
so her finger was pointed to the left.

289
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,064
Left?

290
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:36,664
In other words, the person who was in the fitting room to the left...

291
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,964
I didn't do it!

292
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,364
If the person that I killed had her hand in her pocket,

293
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,664
I would take it out and confirm!

294
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:50,664
Because she may be holding some evidence!

295
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:53,064
Besides, the perp may have

296
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,364
changed the direction of the corpse after killing her?

297
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:59,364
You're right.

298
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:03,564
Hey! Maybe this is a number?

299
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:04,665
What?

300
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,364
Number? This?

301
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:14,264
The victim used to go a lot overseas, right?

302
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:17,464
She said that she was going to a party overseas next week too.

303
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:21,664
Yes. She used to travel the world every week.

304
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:23,464
In order to expand the market.

305
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,564
Then, she must've gone a lot to Europe too?

306
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,565
Yes.

307
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,264
When they gesture using their fingers to represent numbers,

308
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:34,564
in Europe, the thumb means one,

309
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,364
the index finger is erected for two

310
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:39,464
and the middle finger for three.

311
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:42,864
In other words, this shape means two.

312
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,964
It's indicating you, Ms. Nitsuka!

313
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,164
Hey, you gotta be joking?

314
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:53,064
Why would I have to kill that woman who has nothing to do with me?

315
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,664
No, well...

316
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,564
Hey, Conan.

317
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,064
Is it really like that in Europe?

318
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:04,364
I saw on TV that they do so in Germany and France.

319
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:07,864
But at the place where I went to study abroad,

320
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,964
when indicating numbers to someone,

321
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:11,564
it was the same as in Japan.

322
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:12,964
First the index finger,

323
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,064
then the middle finger

324
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,464
and the ring finger were erected in that order.

325
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,664
You went to America, didn't you, Sera?

326
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:23,964
American counts in the same way as Japan!

327
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,164
That's right!

328
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,764
Come to think of it,

329
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,565
that shape of the hands resembles something, doesn't it?

330
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,365
A gun?

331
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:42,364
The guns that the Japanese police use are...

332
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,364
New Nanbus!

333
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:45,864
That's it!

334
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:49,164
If so, that makes you the perp, Ms. Nanbu.

335
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,464
What?

336
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,365
I'm not the perp!

337
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,364
In other words,

338
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,664
if only the shape of the left hand,

339
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:02,164
it can be interpreted in many ways.

340
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:07,364
If so, the problem is her right hand that had lipstick on

341
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,164
and was grabbing a fist.

342
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,764
I have no idea what it means.

343
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:16,764
And it's a mystery that no one heard the victim's scream too.

344
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:17,964
Yeah.

345
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:20,964
Usually if someone comes into the fitting room,

346
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:24,564
anyone would scream at that point.

347
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:28,764
At any rate, I'll have to hear you three out individually

348
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,465
in a separate room.

349
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,364
Then, may I go to the room too?

350
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,964
What? Why?

351
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,864
He said a while ago, didn't he?

352
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,865
That he saw the victim and those three arguing with each other.

353
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:51,864
I guess I don't have a choice.

354
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,564
Okay then, Conan.

355
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:57,464
Then I'll go along as Conan's guardian.

356
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,565
What?

357
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:45,164
"Next Episode" -All three drew similar pictures.

358
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:50,564
The thing is how did the perp make it into the fitting room?

359
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:51,764
Yeah.

360
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:56,064
The perp's reflection should've been seen on this mirror.

361
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:57,664
I see.

362
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,764
So, that's what happened.

363
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:03,064
But what would anyone use something like this for?

364
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:06,565
We're going to make the other customer!

365
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:12,565
