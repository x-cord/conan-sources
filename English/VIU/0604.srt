1
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,113
Shoko.

2
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,113
Kira has...

3
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:16,013
Resurrected!

4
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,513
That's ridiculous.

5
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:25,313
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:27,813
Tears are start of all dramas.

7
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,213
The incident takes an unexpected turn.

8
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,513
The mystery deepens, now for the 2nd locked room.

9
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,213
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:35,313
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,913
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:23,722
We got lost and coincidentally ended up at a strange house.

13
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:27,122
They were about to hold a seance to summon

14
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,122
the spirit of idol Kira Miyahara who had died

15
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,222
of an accident a year ago, when we arrived.

16
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:35,722
They explained that rumors concerning Kira's curse

17
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,822
was going around among Kira's fan club members.

18
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:39,922
It went as far as a murder being committed,

19
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:43,422
so it prompt them to ascertain the cause of the events.

20
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,522
All of the phenomenon that occurred at the seance

21
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,222
turned out to be a hoax,

22
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:51,122
but there seemed to be something behind Kira's death.

23
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:52,622
Late that night,

24
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:55,222
in the meditation room, where the seance was held,

25
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:56,722
one of the participants,

26
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:59,622
Ms. Shoko Utakura was found killed.

27
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:09,222
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (2nd Locked room)"

28
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,522
Mr. Honogi?

29
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,622
Oh my god! Mr. Hirasaka is...

30
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:23,222
What seems to be the problem?

31
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:25,822
Mr. Hirasaka is dead.

32
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,722
He looks to be dead!

33
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,122
What?

34
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,722
Is that true?

35
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:34,122
No!

36
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,022
Mr. Hirasaka too?

37
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:39,622
What do you mean, "too"?

38
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,422
Shoko's been killed.

39
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,922
In this room.

40
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,622
What?

41
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:48,622
Oh, no.

42
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:51,322
Where? Please take us there!

43
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:52,822
"I have returned to life, Kira" -I received a strange mail,

44
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,422
"I have returned to life, Kira" -so I went to his room

45
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:55,722
to talk it over with him.

46
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:58,122
The door was locked, and there was no answer

47
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,422
despite my knocking on the door.

48
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,922
I was contemplating what I should do

49
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:05,722
when I heard the ringtone of the cell phone from inside the room.

50
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,122
A ringtone?

51
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,722
Since it was the sound of Shoko's cell phone,

52
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,522
I thought that something was strange

53
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:15,022
and looked in through the ventilation window above the door.

54
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,022
You found Mr. Hirasaka dead?

55
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,922
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:30,022
This is not something a child should look at.

57
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:36,622
Mr. Hirasaka!

58
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:41,422
Mr. Hirasaka...

59
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:45,922
Where's the key to this room?

60
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:48,322
Only Mr. Hirasaka has it.

61
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,622
Anything to pry open the door?

62
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,622
Oh, there's a tool box in the storage room

63
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,122
at the end of the corridor!

64
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,522
There!

65
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,922
Mr. Hirasaka.

66
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,322
What's this?

67
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:27,722
This is a poster.

68
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:32,022
Probably the poster of Kira that was in the meditation room!

69
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,722
All of this?

70
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:37,422
Those were the pieces of the posters that have been torn apart,

71
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:38,722
scattered over the floor.

72
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:41,622
Why on earth would anybody do something like this?

73
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,222
How's Mr. Hirasaka?

74
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,522
This is. Shoko's?

75
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:04,822
Probably.

76
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,522
And...

77
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:12,122
The rope that was used to kill Shoko?

78
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,322
The victim is Ms. Shoko Utakura.

79
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:21,122
She seems to be gravure model in the making.

80
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,522
Shoko Utakura?

81
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,722
That name sounds familiar.

82
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:30,322
She's the one who first found the corpse of the editor

83
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:33,022
who was murdered about half a month ago.

84
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:36,522
Oh, that's the case that Inspector Shiratori is handling!

85
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,522
What?

86
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,822
In that incident, the victim

87
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:43,822
seems to left a blood written dying message of the name "Kira".

88
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,922
This text mail was sent to all those concerned

89
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,722
"I have returned to life, Kira" -before the corpse was found.

90
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,422
It's Kira on this side too but...

91
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,922
Are you saying that this case has something to do

92
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,822
with the case that Shiratori is in charge of?

93
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:59,022
Weird things were found here and there of the room.

94
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:03,222
Yeah, those are the seeds of the trick used during the seance.

95
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,622
A seance?

96
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:07,722
The thing where you summon the spirit of the dead?

97
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,122
That's it.

98
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:13,022
They had a seance here last night.

99
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,322
The spirit they were trying to summon was

100
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:20,622
of idol actress Kira Miyahara who died of an accident a year ago.

101
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:23,222
Kira Miyahara?

102
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,722
I'm not too familiar myself either.

103
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:30,122
But it seems she was a charismatic figure of cosplay sites.

104
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:33,122
Cosplay, meaning dressing up in outfits

105
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:35,022
like characters in comics or animations.

106
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,322
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,522
And before she died it seems like

108
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:41,122
she was doing gravure modelling and actress work too.

109
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:44,222
She seems to have had quite fervent fans too.

110
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:47,322
And? Why did they hold the seance?

111
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:52,922
It seems that a weird rumor was spreading in her fan club recently.

112
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:55,122
About a curse or something.

113
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:56,322
A curse?

114
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,622
There were rumors going around that the death

115
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:01,722
of the editor was also due to Kira's curse,

116
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,722
so they decided to hold a seance to summon her spirit

117
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:07,622
and ask her for the truth.

118
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:10,922
And did the spirit appear?

119
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,822
Of course not.

120
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,522
It was all a hoax.

121
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:18,722
The ones who set it up were Mr. Hirasaka and Mr. Honogi.

122
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,822
I guess they just wanted to surprise everybody.

123
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:25,622
However, the contents of Kira's voice that they set up beforehand,

124
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:28,722
seem to have been switched by someone.

125
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,822
I shall resurrect tonight

126
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:40,922
to avenge my death with my own hands!

127
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,922
It's most probably the doings of the culprit.

128
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:51,422
The culprit is using Kira's name who died of an accident,

129
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:54,422
and committing murders repeatedly.

130
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:59,622
There's another thing that struck me as odd.

131
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,422
I didn't detect any defensive wounds on her.

132
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,522
The only trace left on the corpse

133
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:06,922
was a strangulation mark on the throat

134
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,522
made with a thin rope like thing.

135
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,022
Could it be that she was drugged to sleep or something

136
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,522
and then strangled?

137
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,922
This sure is a strange room, this room.

138
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:24,122
This is called the meditation room

139
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:26,122
where Mr. Hirasaka confines himself to,

140
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,722
when thinking over plans for his comics.

141
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,822
Is it true that this room was locked

142
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,922
at the time the corpse was found?

143
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,522
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:39,122
The only entrance to this room is through these doors.

145
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:44,022
The door was locked from the inside with this padlock.

146
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,622
It seems that Mr. Hirasaka

147
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:48,222
is the only one who has the key to open this lock.

148
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,922
The key hasn't been found from inside the room yet.

149
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:54,722
There's a ventilation window over there,

150
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,822
but there's no footing to climb up there.

151
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:00,322
If you use the easels and chairs here,

152
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:01,922
maybe it can be done?

153
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:04,422
Even if you were to stack the easels up on the chair and climb,

154
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,222
the window can't be reached.

155
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,522
If the window were to be reached somehow,

156
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:10,922
evidence of the footing should still be under the window.

157
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,922
But, there was no such thing.

158
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:16,022
Besides, that window is powered by electricity,

159
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:20,022
so it can be opened and closed only by using this switch.

160
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,022
But, if you take your hand off the switch...

161
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,722
It stopped.

162
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:31,922
The same goes when you close it.

163
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:36,422
You have to keep pushing it or it can't be closed completely.

164
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,522
So, you can't escape from that window.

165
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:43,222
Then, how did the culprit get away?

166
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,322
Is it Kira's ghost after all?

167
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:48,622
It can't be.

168
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:53,322
A completely locked room.

169
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:01,322
So this is it.

170
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:04,922
In the meditation room last night,

171
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:08,922
there were several posters of Kira decorated as props.

172
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,422
It seems that the posters were brought in here

173
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:12,322
and shredded to pieces.

174
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:15,122
Why would anybody go out of his way to do something like that?

175
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,722
I don't know.

176
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,422
How about it, Chiba?

177
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:21,522
We suspect he was poisoned by cyanide compounds.

178
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:24,622
We think it was mixed into his wine.

179
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:27,922
Was this room also locked?

180
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:29,022
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,622
We were told that Mr. Hirasaka

182
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,822
was the only one who had the key to this room.

183
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:36,522
So, I had no choice but to pry it open.

184
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,422
Did you find the key?

185
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:41,022
It wasn't in the drawer of the desk.

186
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:44,522
The only place left to look is the drawer over there, I guess.

187
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:47,322
This drawer is locked.

188
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,622
Oh, it opened.

189
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,322
I found the key!

190
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,922
This seems to be the key.

191
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:07,922
But it won't move because the shaft

192
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:11,422
was probably bent out of shape when it was pried open.

193
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:13,222
It seems that the key is made in Germany

194
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:16,322
and cannot easily be duplicated.

195
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:18,822
In order to lock this door,

196
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,622
that key is necessary for both locking it

197
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,522
from outside and inside.

198
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,322
Yes, it seems to be so.

199
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:28,522
The other one could be for that padlock.

200
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,122
Confirm it, will you?

201
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:32,522
Yes, sir!

202
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,422
What about the rope that was on the floor?

203
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,322
We can't say for sure until we run a test and confirm a match,

204
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:40,222
but there's a high probability that it's the murder weapon

205
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,622
used to kill Shoko.

206
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,122
What about that window?

207
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:45,522
It was locked from the inside.

208
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:49,222
Either way, there are decorative iron bars on the outside,

209
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,122
so going in and out from there isn't possible.

210
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:53,022
So, this was also a locked room.

211
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,322
Right.

212
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,622
This ventilation window only opens about 10cm,

213
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:00,322
making this door the only entrance.

214
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,422
That key was found inside the room in a drawer

215
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:06,422
that was also locked, so...

216
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,622
No, inspector, if we look at it from a different angle,

217
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,822
this locked room murder is as good as solved.

218
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,222
What?

219
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,822
It's suicide.

220
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,322
Suicide?

221
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:20,522
Hirasaka is the one who killed Shoko.

222
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,222
Then after he returned to this room,

223
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:26,222
he locked the door and drank poisoned wine.

224
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,622
I see.

225
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:32,922
It could be that Mr. Hirasaka killed Editor Sawanami too.

226
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:36,622
But, "Kira" was left written at the scene of the crime, right?

227
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:39,222
Mr. Hirasaka is the one who wrote that too.

228
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,022
He was also was the one who sent the text mail out

229
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,422
from Shoko's cell phone.

230
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,822
He probably wanted to make it appear

231
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:50,122
as if the main character of his comics appeared in reality

232
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,822
and committed serial killings.

233
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:55,022
If so, this room wouldn't have to be locked, would it?

234
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:57,322
Because it would easily give away the fact that he committed suicide.

235
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,822
His comics, The Blackmagic Girl, was it?

236
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:03,722
The main character Kira is a witch.

237
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:06,222
That's why he probably wanted to make it look like an impossible crime,

238
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,522
in which a magic spell was used!

239
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:13,422
It does sort of seem to make sense.

240
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:17,522
I hope you solved the other locked room mystery too.

241
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,322
Well, not quite yet.

242
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,022
Is that so?

243
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:23,622
However, the only one who had the key to the meditation room

244
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,422
was Hirasaka.

245
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,422
I saw him lock the door from the outside with a padlock

246
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,222
after the seance.

247
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:34,022
No one besides Hirasaka could've gone into that room.

248
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,722
Even if he were to have committed suicide,

249
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:40,122
would he go out of his way to put the key away in a drawer,

250
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:42,822
and lock that drawer as well?

251
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:45,422
And besides,

252
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:51,322
why did he have to tear up Kira's posters like this?

253
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,502
Everyone, I hate to do this

254
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,102
knowing that you're all tired,

255
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,802
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

256
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:13,102
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Itakura was found at 01:00.

257
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,902
After that, Mr. Hirasaka's body was also found.

258
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:19,002
The estimated time of death for both people

259
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,202
was between 23:00 to 01:00.

260
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:25,302
Therefore, I would like you to tell me

261
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,202
what each of you were doing during this time.

262
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,702
Last night, after the seance,

263
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,702
there was a strange atmosphere going around so...

264
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:36,602
We all went back to our rooms without wasting any time.

265
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,702
It was around 22:00.

266
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,602
After returning to my room,

267
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:44,402
I was looking forward to Kira resurrecting right through

268
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,102
without sleeping a wink.

269
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,102
Maho, Mr. Mifune and I,

270
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:53,902
talked to Mr. Mouri for a while,

271
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,802
so I guess we left for our rooms at around 23:00.

272
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:58,602
Back then, you called Shoko, didn't you?

273
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:01,802
Oh. Do you know what time it was?

274
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,202
Yes.

275
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,502
At 22:40.

276
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:10,702
Back then, she said that she had a headache.

277
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:14,102
After that you went to check on her, didn't you, Maho?

278
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,102
Yes.

279
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,702
I was worried so I went to look in on her,

280
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:22,102
but Shoko wasn't in her room.

281
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:25,502
My room is right next to hers, so I waited for her to return

282
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,602
hoping to give her some medicine,

283
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:33,702
but she didn't return so I got worried,

284
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,102
and went to Mr. Mouri for help.

285
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:40,802
Is there anyone who met Mr. Hirasaka after the seance?

286
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:47,702
Oh, before I returned to my room,

287
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:51,402
I talked to him for a little while in his room.

288
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,202
What did you talk about?

289
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:56,402
About somebody having switched Kira's voice

290
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:59,502
that we set up beforehand the seance.

291
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:03,102
But, I returned to my room in about 15 minutes.

292
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:08,602
Why did you decide to have a seance?

293
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,302
Why...

294
00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:13,102
Because there were strange rumors going around

295
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:15,402
in the fan club about Kira casting a curse.

296
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,602
And even murder was committed so...

297
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,502
Do you seriously believe in spirits and curses?

298
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,302
Oh, not really.

299
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:26,502
It's true that it's not something that a sensible adult would do.

300
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:29,602
Didn't you have some other purpose for carrying it out?

301
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:32,702
Well...

302
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,302
Come to think of it, Mr. Honogi,

303
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,602
you mentioned receiving strange calls in the past, didn't you?

304
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,402
Well...

305
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,602
What're you talking about, Yatsukawa?

306
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,702
Well, I think it was a month ago,

307
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,302
we coincidentally ran into each other at a snack bar

308
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:49,102
and drank together.

309
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,402
Yes. Hello.

310
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:57,602
What happened?

311
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:00,802
I've been getting upsetting phone calls recently.

312
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:03,002
I wonder who on earth it is.

313
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:08,402
Weren't you being blackmailed by somebody?

314
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:10,702
No, that's not true.

315
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,302
Come to think of it,

316
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,502
Mr. Sawanami also received strange letters.

317
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,002
Really?

318
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:21,502
Yes, when I went to the publisher

319
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:25,102
to make arrangements for a magazine about a month ago...

320
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,602
Mr. Sawanami, do you know about the rumor that's going around?

321
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,102
Rumor?

322
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:32,002
It seems that the members of the fan club

323
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:34,202
who have switched to become fans of other idols

324
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:38,202
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

325
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,702
What?

326
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:44,702
Some people seem to claim seeing Kira after they got hurt.

327
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,402
Ridiculous.

328
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:48,102
Are you saying that Kira's ghost

329
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:51,502
is haunting the fans who have become fans of other idols?

330
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:54,702
Gosh. Not again.

331
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,102
Is that Kira?

332
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:01,002
It's nothing.

333
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:03,002
It's just a prank.

334
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,802
He said, "Not again"?

335
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,402
Yes.

336
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:11,202
Mr. Sawanami was being blackmailed by somebody

337
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:13,802
and killed.

338
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,602
Mr. Honogi, how about you?

339
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:19,102
I...

340
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,702
Please tell us the truth.

341
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:27,302
It's true that I was being blackmailed.

342
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:29,402
What kind of blackmail?

343
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,302
Kira didn't die of an accident

344
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,302
but rather, here, during the party.

345
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:41,602
And Mr. Hirasaka has hidden Kira's body.

346
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:45,902
There was a similar rumor spreading through the internet too.

347
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,902
Someone probably took it for fact, and committed the murders.

348
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,702
Mr. Sawanami and Mr. Hirasaka were also being blackmailed.

349
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:56,302
But, it was just nonsense, a baseless rumor!

350
00:19:56,302 --> 00:20:00,302
And yet, Mr. Sawanami ended up the way he did!

351
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:03,402
I wonder if the blackmailer is the culprit?

352
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,502
Could it be that everyone was gathered here

353
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,502
to search for the blackmailer?

354
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:12,402
Under the pretense of holding a seance.

355
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,202
Is that right?

356
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:20,802
That's right, after discussing it with Mr. Hirasaka.

357
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,702
Kira's fervent fan, Mr. Kani.

358
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:30,702
Shoko and Maho who worshipped Kira as a charismatic figure.

359
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:33,002
Mr. Yatsukawa, assistant director from the TV station

360
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:34,402
are also to be suspected.

361
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,702
Mr. Mifune too.

362
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,202
Is that why you called us over here?

363
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,902
No joke.

364
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,902
Mr. Hirasaka suggested that

365
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:52,102
we scare everyone at the seance and watch their reaction.

366
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:54,902
If Kira's voice that you set up beforehand

367
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:56,502
was switched by someone,

368
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:59,902
it could be that the blackmailer is among someone here after all.

369
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,802
So, it's highly likely that the person who killed Mr. Sawanami

370
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,402
and the culprit of this case is one and the same.

371
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:07,302
It could be that Kira's family or lover

372
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:09,502
believed the rumors on the internet and...

373
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,602
Kira had no family.

374
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:14,402
They seemed to have died in a car accident when she was a child.

375
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:18,702
Oh, that's why Kira was more into safe driving than anyone else.

376
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:20,302
It seems so.

377
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,802
Pops, why don't you have them show you

378
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:26,302
the word "Kira" that Mr. Sawanami left behind?

379
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,102
Maybe it'll help you come up with something.

380
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:32,202
Well, true.

381
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,502
Inspector.

382
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,802
Why not?

383
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:38,002
-Takagi. -Yes, sir.

384
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,002
Inspector.

385
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,002
This key was the key for the padlock in question after all.

386
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,202
I see.

387
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:52,102
And, as for the rope that was found in Mr. Hirasaka's room,

388
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,402
there's no doubt that it was used to kill Ms. Utakura.

389
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,002
Just as I thought.

390
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:00,202
If so, just as I deduced, Hirasaka's the...

391
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:04,902
But, unless we solve the other locked room mystery...

392
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:07,402
Maybe there's a secret escape route

393
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,102
in the meditation room or something?

394
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:11,102
There could never be such a thing.

395
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,502
Mr. Mouri, I'm had the picture of the word

396
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,002
sent over by mail right now.

397
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:22,402
"Kira"

398
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,702
This is...

399
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:27,602
Don't tell me the culprit is that person.

400
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:37,802
"Kira"

401
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,302
"Next Episode"

402
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:02,302
I've got to solve the mystery of the two locked rooms!

403
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:04,902
She used a magic spell!

404
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,902
Kira became a witch after all, you know!

405
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:11,302
If it's just as I've imagined,

406
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,802
this room is much too sad.

407
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:18,802
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami wanted to relay...

408
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:23,602
Next Conan,

409
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:27,802
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (Locked Room Opened)"

410
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:45,502
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,702
"Ninja Technique"

412
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,902
Ninja technique, "sober up"!

413
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,402
Karate breathing method, "Seiya"!
