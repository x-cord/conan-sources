1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:02,547
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:04,547
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:05,847
The children are playing baseball and the ball flies into a house.

4
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,347
Where objects are toppled upside down and a man is killed.

5
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:09,047
Something about his room is not right!

6
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,647
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:12,247
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,548
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,606
Sensei!

10
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,607
Yeah.

11
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,306
Hi, Editor Shimaki.

12
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:18,806
What do you mean, "Hi, Shimaki"?

13
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,006
And what is it you want?

14
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,106
Just what're you talking about, Sensei?

15
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:26,306
Just joking, I'm just joking.

16
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,106
Please, come on.

17
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,406
You want the manuscript, don't you?

18
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:32,406
Yes! Yes, Manda Sensei.

19
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:36,106
Please stop joking with me and give it to me,

20
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:37,806
I'm really in a fix.

21
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,406
Yeah.

22
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:44,606
The printers are saying they can only wait for another two hours.

23
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,406
Yeah. Two hours is more than enough.

24
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,006
Two hours?

25
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,806
All I have left to do is to write the final plot,

26
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:55,306
then write the epilogue, so it's no big deal.

27
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:56,706
Really?

28
00:02:56,707 --> 00:03:00,106
Yes, really. Please trust me.

29
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:02,607
You've know me for a long time, haven't you?

30
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,306
Hey, Nobel.

31
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,106
Please watch Sensei so that he doesn't run out on me!

32
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,306
I'm counting on you!

33
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:16,307
If he tries to run away, you can go ahead and bite him.

34
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:22,106
Okay, I'll be waiting at that elevator hall.

35
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:24,606
So, let me know when you're done!

36
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,607
Okay.

37
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,007
I know.

38
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:14,307
"Result of the Tumble (Part 1)"

39
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:47,406
Yes, in another two hours.

40
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,506
Yes, he says it'll be finished.

41
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,506
Yes, Sensei himself is saying so, therefore, please...

42
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:56,106
I think he'll be done too.

43
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:59,307
Yes, please don't worry, I'll make sure he writes it.

44
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:17,406
Teitan Elementary School 1st grade Class B,

45
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:21,707
"Towel Prince" Genta Kojima, facing a no-hit no run.

46
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:29,406
Two-out and bases loaded! Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya is doing just great.

47
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,607
Here goes the first pitch.

48
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,607
I got him.

49
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,407
I did it.

50
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,306
We're counting on you, Edogawa.

51
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,606
What do you mean you're counting on me? Hey.

52
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,307
The ball! The ball!

53
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:51,606
All right!

54
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,407
You can count on me.

55
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,307
I won!

56
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:10,706
Conan's fantastic.

57
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,906
If this were soccer, yes.

58
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:17,206
Take the ball with your glove because this isn't soccer.

59
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:20,806
Conan, don't tell me you're making light of baseball?

60
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,806
He's right, Conan!

61
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:26,506
Play like you should, come on.

62
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,606
Sorry. Sorry.

63
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,006
I can't help it, can I?

64
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,306
It's just a habit from playing soccer

65
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,207
that legs respond faster than my hands.

66
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,406
Sensei?

67
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:56,706
I've been waiting for you. I was really looking forward to seeing you.

68
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,207
Manda Sensei.

69
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:00,906
What's with that outfit of yours?

70
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,806
Don't tell me you disguised yourself as a bellboy

71
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,206
and escaped from the hotel again?

72
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,606
You never learn, do you?

73
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,306
Yeah.

74
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,206
Because I was confined.

75
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,607
This is the fastest, easiest way to get free.

76
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,406
No one notices me this way.

77
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,106
Nobel is with you.

78
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,406
Nobel! Nobel!

79
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,206
Oh, that a boy.

80
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,107
It's me!

81
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,306
If neither of us, you or me aren't around,

82
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:36,307
he may go berserk and hurt himself badly.

83
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:39,506
Huh?

84
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,006
Never mind that,

85
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,806
is it ready? The manuscript.

86
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,606
Yes. I finished it six hours ago.

87
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,406
What? Six hours ago?

88
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:53,606
But when I called you from the hotel a while ago,

89
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,406
you said you needed a little more time, didn't you?

90
00:07:56,407 --> 00:08:00,306
I was kind of enjoying your panicky voice that I lied to you.

91
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,607
Please don't be offended.

92
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,006
Hey, hey. Haramoto!

93
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,206
I mean, it's really no big deal, is it?

94
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:09,406
Because I'm going through quite a bit of stress

95
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,607
ghost writing for you too.

96
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:16,506
Of course, in return I will get paid a lot.

97
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,107
So, I don't really have any complaints.

98
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,106
Here you go!

99
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,407
Here's the manuscript!

100
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:32,206
I wrote a happy ending to it just like you wanted me to.

101
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,606
Thank you.

102
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:39,506
Did you tell them about me already?

103
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:43,306
After I hand this over to them, I'm going to meet the editor

104
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:46,206
to discuss about the next series at my place.

105
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:50,207
After all that's done, I'll bring the editor over here.

106
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:54,006
Really? Thank you.

107
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,606
I'm really happy.

108
00:08:55,607 --> 00:09:00,106
Well, if you make your debut, it might be time for me to retire.

109
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,606
Don't worry about it.

110
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,406
I'll continue ghost writing for you.

111
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,906
What I'll be writing are detective stories that you don't write!

112
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,407
The writing style is also different!

113
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:13,006
Different writing style?

114
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:16,307
The fact is, it's almost done!

115
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,506
My debut story!

116
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,806
You can look through it if you like.

117
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,806
It's written in a style so different from yours.

118
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:29,206
But, with this, I get to join the circle of novelists.

119
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:30,706
If I become a selling novelist,

120
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:33,107
I'll get to collect a lot more different things.

121
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,606
Come to think of it, you're a collector, aren't you?

122
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,506
Yes. I've always liked collecting all kinds of things

123
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,706
since my childhood.

124
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,906
But, the thing I want most now is...

125
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:48,406
the prize awarded to new writers, the Akutayama Award.

126
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,506
You're one of the judges too, aren't you, Sensei?

127
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,406
So I'll be able to win the award, won't I?

128
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,406
Unless I get this award,

129
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:58,706
I won't be able to collect other awards later on!

130
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:03,806
Oh, talking about collecting, I finally found the thing I was lacking!

131
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,207
Oh.

132
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:23,306
It really feels good after all to have the entire collection.

133
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,007
Well, I'm really happy for you!

134
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,606
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

135
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,506
Come on, Nobel, let's go home.

136
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,406
Nobel?

137
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:55,207
Nobel? Nobel?

138
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,206
Where are you, Nobel?

139
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,706
Come on out!

140
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:10,906
Nobel?

141
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,507
Where are you?

142
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,007
My, God.

143
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:20,506
Quick. Quick, to the hotel.

144
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:23,006
Sensei. Manda Sensei.

145
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,306
I've got to get back to the hotel quickly.

146
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,306
Sensei? Sensei?

147
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:29,606
My alibi won't work...

148
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:32,706
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

149
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,206
What shall I do?

150
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,606
Sensei? It's two hours already!

151
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,106
What shall I do?

152
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:41,906
Sensei.

153
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,107
Manda Sensei.

154
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:55,617
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

155
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,217
Huh?

156
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,316
Sensei?

157
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,416
Talk about noisy.

158
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,716
I finished writing it a while ago, and I'm just checking it now!

159
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,416
Oh, I see!

160
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,616
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:16,816
I think it's quite a good piece myself, so rest assured.

162
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:17,916
Here you go.

163
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,316
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:22,516
Thank you. Thank you for finishing!

165
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:26,116
By the way, where's Nobel?

166
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:28,616
He always comes to the door.

167
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,916
Where is he?

168
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,516
Oh, he's in the carry bag asleep.

169
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,716
In the carry bag?

170
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,516
I guess so.

171
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:45,216
I'll go back to the editor's room and check on the manuscript.

172
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:47,716
Oh, then why don't you do it here in this room,

173
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:51,616
and send the data to the printers from here?

174
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,516
Wouldn't that be faster?

175
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:58,116
And while they're doing the printing, you can come to my house

176
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:01,216
and we can talk over arrangements for the next series.

177
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:04,116
Oh, no. Because the next series you'll be writing

178
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,916
is still some time away so...

179
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,016
I'm sure you'll like it.

180
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:13,117
The next series is something I've never written on about yet.

181
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,816
A mystery?

182
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:20,916
You who specialize in historical novels?

183
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,216
Are you joking?

184
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,616
No, I'm not joking. I'll bet I surprised you.

185
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:27,416
I've wanted to try writing a mystery novel at least once,

186
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,617
from some time ago.

187
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,516
I see.

188
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,416
That's something to look forward to.

189
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,416
I'd like to see it soon myself too.

190
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,517
Yes, yes.

191
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:44,516
Sensei, please tell me more in detail about this.

192
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,916
Well, I already decided on the character of the detective.

193
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,916
I'll talk more about it when we get to my house.

194
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:55,516
What? Don't keep me in suspense, and tell me about it.

195
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,416
Well, well.

196
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:00,816
Nobel sure is quiet, isn't he?

197
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,916
Is he okay?

198
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,816
Yeah, I guess.

199
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,716
He was running around all afternoon, so I think he got tired.

200
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,816
Don't worry.

201
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,317
I guess so.

202
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,516
Wait here a while, will you?

203
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:31,016
It's a little messy so I'll go clean up a bit.

204
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,717
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

205
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:39,517
Nobel!

206
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:42,917
Nobel! Nobel!

207
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,617
Nobel!

208
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:58,617
You're back, good boy.

209
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,417
Perfect.

210
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,116
The perfect crime has been established.

211
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,517
Right, Nobel?

212
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,717
What was that?

213
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:25,016
What that sound just now?

214
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:30,616
It seems as if the glass or something of the house opposite here cracked.

215
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,016
It seems like the ball of the children who were playing baseball

216
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,216
hit the window and struck it.

217
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,517
What?

218
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,416
Gee.

219
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,816
Genta, you really fly the ball too far.

220
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,516
Well, I can't help it because it flew away.

221
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:49,516
Tell the ball where to go then.

222
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:54,616
But it's strange, no one is answering.

223
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:57,716
Maybe the ball hit the head of the owner of this house

224
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,016
and he passed out or something?

225
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:01,016
What?

226
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,616
Even if that were to be the case,

227
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:05,816
we have no way of knowing unless we go inside.

228
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,717
-My... -Huh?

229
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,416
Hey, wait a moment.

230
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,117
Haibara?

231
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:16,417
It's open after all.

232
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,616
Excuse me!

233
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:22,317
But, it's more like we're intruding.

234
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,516
The room that the ball went inside is...

235
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,716
Hey, Conan!

236
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,816
Are you sure it's okay that we're stepping into the house like this?

237
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:34,016
Conan! We'll be caught for trespassing.

238
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,916
Conan!

239
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,816
Haibara!

240
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:41,916
Let's say we have no other choice. How's that?

241
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,217
We're entering!

242
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,816
Excuse me?

243
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,917
Is anybody home?

244
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,116
Excuse me.

245
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,816
We're not suspicious people.

246
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:58,216
Huh? Something about this room is strange.

247
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,416
Yes. Something sure feels strange.

248
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,616
I wonder what it is.

249
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:05,116
Can't you tell just by looking?

250
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,816
Over there!

251
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:12,416
The mini cars, dolls and books that are lined on the shelf

252
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,816
are almost all toppled and upside down.

253
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,316
Why?

254
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,716
Don't tell me...

255
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:21,817
it's because my ball flew inside here?

256
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,916
Maybe because of that,

257
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,617
there was a warp in space and a supernatural phenomenon occurred.

258
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:35,316
Mitsuhiko, something's not right and besides there is no warp.

259
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,716
The ball that Genta hit...

260
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,216
I'm not going to let you beat me.

261
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:43,616
Here goes Genta! Hit this ball if you can.

262
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,817
No matter what kind of ball it is...

263
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,816
-Edogawa! -Conan!

264
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,817
Huh? What?

265
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:55,916
Oh no! This is a big one!

266
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:59,717
Genta really hit the ball hard.

267
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:16,116
The ball just coincidentally happened to go through

268
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:18,216
the open window of this house, so...

269
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:20,716
But the sound of something cracking was heard, right?

270
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,516
Maybe the ball hit a flower vase or something that was in the room

271
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:25,516
-and cracked it. -What?

272
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:27,816
You really think so?

273
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,916
What shall I do if I hit something super expensive?

274
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:35,316
I used up all the allowance I got for New Year's too.

275
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,816
Well, the price and all of the object that was hit,

276
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,016
we have no choice but to ask the person who lives here, right?

277
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,017
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

278
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:45,817
I'm sure the ball flew into that room.

279
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,617
That is...

280
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,317
only if the person living here...

281
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:04,117
is able to talk.

282
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:18,917
How about it?

283
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,216
Well, unfortunately...

284
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:26,616
From looks of rigor mortis, he seems to have been dead for an hour or two.

285
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:31,816
The cracked pieces that are scattered around the corpse shows that

286
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,717
he was probably hit on the back of the head with a flower vase.

287
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,816
Don't tell me that

288
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:43,317
the ball that I hit struck the flower vase that was on the shelf

289
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,516
and hit that man on the head?

290
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,116
Genta.

291
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:54,916
Oh no, what shall I do?

292
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,916
What shall I do?

293
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,116
Idiot.

294
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:02,516
You hit the ball just a while ago.

295
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,616
Not an hour or two ago, right?

296
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,816
What shall I do? What shall I do?

297
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:12,816
Besides, your ball seems to have cracked the flower vase over there.

298
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:16,316
Genta, I'm glad!

299
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,016
Saved!

300
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:22,416
Which means someone attacked him from behind?

301
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:25,516
Yeah, he was hit from behind with the flower vase!

302
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,516
When he was looking into the drawer of the desk!

303
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:33,416
How can you tell he was looking into the drawer?

304
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,816
See, the border between the drawer and the desk,

305
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,416
it's bent out of shape and tilted, right?

306
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,816
When he was hit from behind,

307
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,316
he fell towards the drawer

308
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,516
and it serves as evidence that his body pushed against it!

309
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,016
People usually open the drawer

310
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,816
when they want to look for something in the drawer

311
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,716
or take something out of it!

312
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,717
I see.

313
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,616
Just great, Conan.

314
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,216
The thing that bothers me is the room next door.

315
00:20:57,217 --> 00:21:01,016
Yeah. The books, mini cars and dolls that are on the shelf

316
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:04,016
have almost all toppled and are upside down.

317
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:08,716
If the killer did that, what did the killer intend to do?

318
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:10,317
Hey!

319
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:16,716
Just what are you children doing?

320
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:18,816
Mr. Haramoto?

321
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:22,416
Is that Mr. Haramoto lying on the floor there?

322
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,116
Hey, Mr. Haramoto?

323
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:28,116
Haramoto? Mr. Haramoto?

324
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:31,516
Just what are you doing? Hurry and call the police and ambulance.

325
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:34,616
Yes, sir, right away.

326
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:38,016
Come on, children, out of this room!

327
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,817
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:44,217
It's a kitty cat.

329
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:48,116
I wonder where it came in from.

330
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,317
Hi, kitty.

331
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:53,417
Don't touch my cat!

332
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,916
Hurry. Out, out!

333
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,216
When the police arrive, make sure you explain what happened.

334
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,216
He doesn't have to talk in that tone of voice.

335
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,616
You're right.

336
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,616
Okay?

337
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,717
Yeah. Okay.

338
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:02,316
By the way, I think it's about time that you realize.

339
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:06,816
Yes, because there are stranger things in the room on this side.

340
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:08,416
The shelf, shelf!

341
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:13,416
The dolls, mini cars and books are all upside down!

342
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,817
Why?

343
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:19,016
I see.

344
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:21,216
The one who turned everything upside down isn't Mr. Haramoto

345
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:22,516
but the killer.

346
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:28,017
Next Conan, "Result of the Tumble (Part 2)"

347
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:45,616
Next Conan's Hint:

348
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,916
"Unfinished manuscript."

349
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,216
This is my unfinished manuscript.

350
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:50,516
Genta, it's completely white.

351
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:52,617
Didn't I tell you that it was unfinished?
