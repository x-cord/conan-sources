1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,488
While I was coming home from school,

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,788
Officer Yumi Miyamoto forced me to accompany her

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:06,288
as she tailed Shukichi Haneda Meijin,

4
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:09,988
who she suspected of infidelity.

5
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:14,688
However, Haneda Meijin was just meeting a few young shogi players

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,289
at an apartment for a shogi study session.

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,688
It's unlocked.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,188
Mr. Genda?

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,589
Mr. Genda!

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:28,789
Mr. Hishinuma?

11
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:34,388
Mr. Genda, are you okay? Mr. Genda!

12
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:37,488
After that, there was a third victim

13
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:38,988
in this case which the police determined

14
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,889
were a series of serial murders.

15
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,888
Inspector Yuminaga.

16
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,388
What is the situation?

17
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,588
We avoided a total loss,

18
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,888
but the occupant who was in the house was burnt to death.

19
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,688
No vital signs were detected in the body,

20
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,888
so it seemed like he died before the fire broke out.

21
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,888
Shortly before?

22
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,088
You mean he died after that shogi player

23
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,488
was murdered at the Beika City apartment?

24
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,288
I heard from Megure

25
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,288
that a shogi board was found at the crime scene.

26
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,689
We actually found one here, too.

27
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:16,588
A shogi board with three legs missing.

28
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:22,188
Besides that, Taiko Meijin was kidnapped by the culprit.

29
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:27,188
You said Akai's brother seemed to have noticed something.

30
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,688
Why did you think that way?

31
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,688
When the Meijin moved around to take a look at the deceased,

32
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,088
he touched the kitchen counter.

33
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:40,588
He held his hand as though he'd touched something.

34
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:43,788
What was on top of the kitchen counter?

35
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,388
Nothing significant.

36
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:51,189
Just two ice trays, a mixer, and a toaster, I think.

37
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,888
Sounds like there was a magic tool

38
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:01,888
where one of them could have used it to fabricate an alibi.

39
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,889
Oh, right!

40
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,888
It comes to visit after we've fallen asleep!

41
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:07,988
Fall in love with logical reasoning

42
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,288
and the joy of solving mysteries!

43
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,388
What is the final move that will dissolve their alibi?

44
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,088
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,988
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,189
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:06,189
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board (Checkmate)"

48
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,788
It's been a long time, kid.

49
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,888
Since the last time we met, you were wearing this face.

50
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,288
We didn't have a choice.

51
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,888
I doubt you had time to disguise yourself.

52
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,289
Ms. Yukiko was so eager to disguise me.

53
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,788
So, do you know where my brother is?

54
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,088
Most probably, he's being held captive in the culprit's home,

55
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,188
but it seemed that they moved recently.

56
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,188
I could only figure out their phone number.

57
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,088
They answered Officer Yumi's call this morning,

58
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,488
and I wanted to call and get their address from them,

59
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:55,088
but they are very cautious and won't pick up the phone.

60
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:58,288
Naturally, I've been calling the Meijin's phone as well,

61
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,588
but it's been turned off.

62
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,988
Most probably, he expected the culprit to capture him,

63
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:07,188
so he didn't bring along his phone that contains information

64
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,888
about his close friends.

65
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,188
As his brother,

66
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,088
I certainly hoped that he had considered

67
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,689
how not to get captured instead.

68
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,488
Who are you calling?

69
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,888
My brother's other phone.

70
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,888
It is exclusively used for secret conversations.

71
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,488
Like a certain high school detective,

72
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:35,089
I don't officially exist.

73
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,588
An incoming call.

74
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:41,789
It must be my brother.

75
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,788
He picked up.

76
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:49,989
He did?

77
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,388
Hey.

78
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,988
You seem to be waiting for something.

79
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,088
You're a shogi player as well.

80
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,888
If you've got nothing better to do...

81
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,288
Would you like to play a game of blind shogi

82
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:09,989
with this Meijin?

83
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,488
4-5 P.

84
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,488
Same P.

85
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,988
5-5 S.

86
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:23,988
2-4 P.

87
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,788
6-4 P.

88
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,788
Same P.

89
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,888
5-6 G.

90
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,689
2-5 P.

91
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,188
You're good.

92
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,688
In that case, 6-4 S.

93
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,889
5-5 P.

94
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,288
They're playing blind shogi?

95
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:44,788
Yes.

96
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,688
My brother must be up to something.

97
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,888
He might be using the game record of that blind shogi game

98
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,988
to drop hints about the location where he's being held captive.

99
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,088
No, it's not necessary.

100
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,888
I got through his phone, so I can use this.

101
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,288
A GPS?

102
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,788
I'd better hurry to this location now.

103
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,488
Could you listen to my brother's blind shogi match

104
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:14,188
while explaining to me

105
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,989
how you identified the culprit?

106
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,488
The suspects are the following three individuals

107
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:26,088
who said they left the victim in the room to go shopping.

108
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,788
Kosuke Hishinuma, who went to a coffee shop

109
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:32,788
to pick up coffee for everyone.

110
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,588
Mina Katsumata, who bought freshly baked bread at a bakery.

111
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:45,288
And Shoko Uryu, who purchased freezing cold ice cream.

112
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,088
Even if they wanted to acquire

113
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,488
what they purchased earlier to fabricate an alibi...

114
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:54,688
But you could have just used instant coffee and water

115
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,688
from a water heater to make lukewarm coffee, right?

116
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,588
Actually, the water heater is broken right now.

117
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,388
It only dispenses cold water.

118
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,888
How about an electric kettle, then?

119
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,188
I broke that the other day, too.

120
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,388
What about that stove?

121
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,288
Couldn't you use that to boil water?

122
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,288
Well, yes, but...

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,988
But when we found Mr. Genda,

124
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:24,188
Mr. Hishinuma and Mina put the bags they were holding

125
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,288
on top of the stove.

126
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,789
Why don't you check the bottoms of the bags?

127
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:37,088
There's nothing unusual about them.

128
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,688
Then, it's clear that nobody used that stove.

129
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:44,088
We were out shopping for about ten minutes.

130
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,988
If someone used the stove to boil water,

131
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,688
it would have remained hot for about 15 minutes.

132
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,188
The bags should have burnt or melted.

133
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,788
I see.

134
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,288
Who bought these breads, then?

135
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,988
I bought them.

136
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:00,188
That bakery's breads are my favourite.

137
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:03,488
It's just nearby, and I always bought some.

138
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,988
But you could buy the breads beforehand, couldn't you?

139
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,688
I bought hot freshly baked bread.

140
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,988
They really were warm and looked so good.

141
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:17,488
It's too bad they didn't have any freshly fried curry bread, though.

142
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,888
It's their most popular item, so it was sold out.

143
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,488
Well, it doesn't look like there's a microwave here.

144
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,388
It would be impossible to reheat bread.

145
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,288
Ms. Uryu, what did you buy?

146
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,289
Right.

147
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,888
I bought ice cream.

148
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,688
It's from a shop that recently started its operations nearby.

149
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:40,388
Everyone said they loved them after I bought some once.

150
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:45,488
But if you hid the ice cream in the freezer...

151
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,088
Before we went shopping,

152
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,288
we checked to see if we needed to replenish anything.

153
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,988
There wasn't any ice cream then.

154
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:56,188
Our hint is the objects on the kitchen counter

155
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,588
that caught Haneda Meijin's attention.

156
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,788
Two ice trays, a mixer, and a toaster.

157
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,088
There could be a magic tool

158
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,189
where one of them could have used it to fabricate an alibi.

159
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,688
It's the mixer.

160
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,388
The mixer?

161
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:16,088
If you put room temperature water in a mixer

162
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,188
and mix it for five minutes,

163
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,688
the kinetic energy from the friction

164
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:24,788
generated by the water molecules turns into thermal energy.

165
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,888
Its temperature rises three degrees to 42-43 degrees Celsius.

166
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,388
If you put instant coffee in the hot water,

167
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,188
you can make lukewarm coffee.

168
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:39,588
In other words, the culprit pretended to go shopping

169
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,388
and after that, he claimed to have forgotten something

170
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,888
and returned to the room.

171
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,688
He put water in the mixer, and while it was mixing,

172
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,589
he strangled the victim Genda to death with an electrical cord.

173
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,788
They placed the shogi board with two missing legs

174
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,488
which they had earlier hidden in the room two legs next to the body,

175
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:01,289
indicating that Genda was the second victim of the serial murders.

176
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:05,688
Then, they poured the lukewarm water that was heated using the mixer

177
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,088
into cups they had previously purchased from the coffee shop

178
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,988
and made coffee.

179
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:13,188
They put the cups of coffee inside the coffee shop bag

180
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:16,688
and went downstairs to the building entrance.

181
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,588
Then, they pretended that the victim wouldn't let them in

182
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,988
after they went to buy coffee.

183
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:23,288
Right.

184
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,589
Kosuke Hishinuma must be the culprit.

185
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,888
3-3 G.

186
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,989
5-4 B drop.

187
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:52,188
While the investigation was going on for Genda's death,

188
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,988
Kishimoto's house caught fire.

189
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:59,788
A shogi board with three legs missing was placed next to the body

190
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,188
to confuse the order in which the murders took place.

191
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,988
He killed Kishimoto before going to the second crime scene,

192
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:10,289
the Beika City apartment where the study sessions were held.

193
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:12,988
After killing him,

194
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:15,688
he left the body in a room

195
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,988
and set the air-conditioning unit to 37 degrees.

196
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:22,188
He made sure that the house would catch fire

197
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:25,388
automatically after Genda's murder was discovered,

198
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,588
so that a body with a relatively high rectal temperature

199
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,088
would be discovered in the wreckage of the fire.

200
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,488
Naturally, the body was burnt,

201
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:37,588
which broadens the estimated time of death,

202
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,988
but he could also use the number of legs on the shogi board

203
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,988
to convince us that it happened after the second murder.

204
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,688
I see.

205
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:46,988
In other words,

206
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,588
he left a shogi board with one leg missing next to Nishikido,

207
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,988
his first victim,

208
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,388
to lay the groundwork

209
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,888
indicating that it seemed like he killed Kishimoto,

210
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:04,588
his second victim, after Genda, his third victim.

211
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,488
Bingo.

212
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,888
I see it.

213
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,888
The GPS is leading us to that building right in front of us.

214
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,089
Yes.

215
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:21,788
But which unit is the Meijin being held captive?

216
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:26,389
Probably, the blind shogi that he's playing is telling us that.

217
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:35,588
That's how my brother honks his horn.

218
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,588
He must have come to rescue me.

219
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,988
What's wrong, Meijin?

220
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,688
Do you need some time to think?

221
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,589
8-3 B promote.

222
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:49,888
No way! That was a bad move!

223
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,588
My jewelled general

224
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,088
will be taken by your incense chariot now!

225
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,988
An 8-3 B promote

226
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:00,788
means an incense chariot will take his king?

227
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,188
8-3 B is the square eighth from the right

228
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:07,488
and third from the top,

229
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:11,088
which would be the eighth unit

230
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,988
from the right on the third floor below the roof.

231
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,488
And if his piece was promoted, that means it was flipped.

232
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:22,088
In other words, Taiko Meijin is in the room in that location

233
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,888
when the building is viewed from behind.

234
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,888
Mr. Akai.

235
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:29,389
Very impressive, kid.

236
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:37,088
I knew Haneda Meijin would never make a bad move like this.

237
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,088
You tricked me

238
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,188
so you could disclose this location to somebody.

239
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:45,188
If the police found the written confession

240
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,588
and you agreed not to tell anyone about me,

241
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,088
I planned to release you and go into hiding.

242
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,989
But it seems like I'll have to kill you now!

243
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,788
I knew it. He's being held in the living room.

244
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,988
In English, the incense chariot is called the lance, or L for short.

245
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,288
"Living room" starts with an L, too.

246
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,489
But how can we rescue him?

247
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,588
Kid.

248
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,889
Do you see that clothesline pipe on that apartment's balcony?

249
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:27,488
Yes. What about it?

250
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:32,288
Can you use your ball to change its angle?

251
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,688
It isn't impossible.

252
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:38,489
Then, just go along with the plan that I will be telling you.

253
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,788
Seriously. What are the police doing?

254
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,588
It's none of my business,

255
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:51,888
but you should turn yourself in soon.

256
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,088
It's still not too late.

257
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:54,989
Zip it!

258
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:07,788
Mr. Akai, I set my voice changer to loudspeaker mode.

259
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,489
Give the signal in 30 seconds.

260
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,088
Got you.

261
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,989
What just happened?

262
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,788
Where did this ball come from?

263
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,288
This is the MPD!

264
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,288
We're the Special Assault Team!

265
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:33,689
Kosuke Hishinuma, we're watching your every move!

266
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,488
Discard your weapon and give yourself up!

267
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:38,988
Shut up!

268
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,588
Stay away from me!

269
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,488
Or don't you care what happens to the Meijin?

270
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:46,988
I'd expected him to do that.

271
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:47,989
In that case...

272
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,088
That was a warning shot!

273
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,388
A detached force is on its way to your location.

274
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:12,689
Remain there quietly until they arrive.

275
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:34,588
Somehow, I made it in time to tranquilise him.

276
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:38,388
Thanks for saving me, Conan.

277
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:43,088
It wasn't me. It was all Mr. Akai's effort.

278
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,888
I suppose so.

279
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,188
Anyway...

280
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:51,688
Why did the culprit Mr. Hishinuma stay here

281
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,688
instead of going on the run?

282
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:59,388
He was waiting for the police to find the written confession.

283
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:00,988
A written confession?

284
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:02,288
Yes.

285
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:08,388
A letter confessing that those four shogi players were cheating.

286
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,888
Those four shogi players?

287
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,088
Kimiharu Nishikido,

288
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,788
Yasukiyo Genda,

289
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,688
Yuhei Kishimoto,

290
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,488
and Kinji Uryu were using pens

291
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,988
that were equipped with miniature cameras

292
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,688
in their pockets.

293
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:27,788
They sent videos of their matches to their accomplices' phones,

294
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:31,588
who searched the web for expert moves.

295
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,588
They won many games

296
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:34,988
by casually informing each other

297
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,588
about the moves when they passed each other

298
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,389
in the washroom or hallways.

299
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:43,888
Nishikido ranked up without getting caught,

300
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,488
but someone from the Shogi League warned Uryu

301
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:51,188
that he was using the washroom too frequently.

302
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:54,488
When he asked the others what he should do,

303
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:57,488
they apparently responded coldly.

304
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:02,288
They told him to follow the rule of silence and die.

305
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,588
The rule of silence?

306
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,288
The legs of shogi boards

307
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,488
are modelled after the gardenia (kuchinashi) fruit.

308
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:10,489
It comes from the ban against speaking

309
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,988
during someone else's match (kuchi wo dasu).

310
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:19,988
They made their own agreement modelled after the gardenia.

311
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,488
If any of them were at risk of being exposed,

312
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,888
he would commit suicide to keep the group's secret

313
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,088
and protect the others.

314
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:30,288
Because of it, Uryu was forced to commit suicide.

315
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,588
Hishinuma found Uryu's suicide suspicious,

316
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,788
so he tracked down their cheating,

317
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,488
and made his first victim Nishikido confess.

318
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:41,488
To avenge his friend Uryu,

319
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,888
he killed the three of them

320
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:46,788
and left shogi boards with their missing gardenias

321
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,489
at the crime scenes.

322
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,888
Before we began our blind shogi game,

323
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,688
he told me to sit quietly and listen

324
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:59,388
so he could tell me why he did it.

325
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:04,088
Nishikido used their cheating to fix matches.

326
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:07,688
Hishinuma said he was a disgrace to shogi players.

327
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:11,888
Well, the confession was meant to frame Kishimoto,

328
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:15,288
who was discovered dead in the burnt wreckage.

329
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:19,388
It apparently said he killed the other two

330
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:25,688
and himself in order to atone for their cheating.

331
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:30,089
But why haven't the police found the confession?

332
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,988
It was because I got to it before them and took it.

333
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,088
What?

334
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:38,488
At that time, I knew Hishinuma

335
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,388
was responsible for the serial murders.

336
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:46,388
Hishinuma might have burnt down Kishimoto's house, too.

337
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,688
If that was the case,

338
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,988
I deducted that he would place a confession letter

339
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,588
in the apartment's mailbox

340
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,488
so it would seem like

341
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,488
Kishimoto came to the apartment to kill Genda

342
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:02,988
before setting fire to his own home and killing himself.

343
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,488
Come to think of it, Officer Yumi said the Meijin

344
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:09,989
went back inside while they were leaving the building.

345
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,188
That must be the time he took the confession.

346
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:19,689
Well, I'd expect no less from the great Taiko Meijin.

347
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,688
Oh, Camel?

348
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:52,088
I'd like you to take care of something

349
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,188
while the police are escorting the murderer to their car.

350
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:56,189
Yes.

351
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,888
One broken glass window and a bullet stuck in the wall.

352
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,288
Yes.

353
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,788
Yes, that's right.

354
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,189
Thanks for taking care of this, Camel.

355
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,888
Shuichi, I have a question about mum.

356
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:14,888
What about mum?

357
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:18,288
She refuses to meet my girlfriend.

358
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,488
She wouldn't even pick up her phone.

359
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:26,088
You haven't told her I'm alive, have you?

360
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,488
No.

361
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,788
Don't worry.

362
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,989
You'll eventually get to see mum.

363
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:41,789
Once their mist concealing the truth clears.

364
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:48,888

365
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,688
Can't you nod your head in agreement today?

366
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,788
I know.

367
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,288
But, Mr. Ishibashi,

368
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:59,689
you've been keeping something important from me.

369
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,289
Hurry up. They're right behind us.

370
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:07,488
Seriously.

371
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,089
We won't be able to escape at this rate.

372
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,488
Next Conan,

373
