1
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,511
Just as expected of a great detective,

2
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:12,411
"Eisuke Kataoka (54)" -figuring out the hide-out of Thief K!

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:15,411
So, you've finally appeared, Thief K!

4
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:18,211
"Makoto Sada (57)" -Master, it's dangerous!

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,711
Please come down!

6
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,411
Shut up, Sada!

7
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:24,411
Don't call me master! I'm Thief K!

8
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:26,011
Master!

9
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:31,211
That's the guy who invited us over for dinner, right?

10
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:32,911
What is this about?

11
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,811
You didn't know?

12
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,211
My father loves detectives so much.

13
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:44,111
"Seiya Kataoka (20)" -And Detective Mouri is his favourite detective.

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,711
Come to think of it,

15
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,111
-there was a statue of him. -This is cool!

16
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,811
That's why sometimes my father urges Detective Mouri to challenge him,

17
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:56,711
-pretending to be a thief. -Get down now, you thief!

18
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:59,511
What a weirdo.

19
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,411
Gosh.

20
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:07,511
"Yurie Kataoka (29)" -Men really are stupid creatures.

21
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:10,511
The time limit is 30 minutes!

22
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,111
Try and catch me!

23
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,711
If you manage to catch me before that grand clock strikes 6pm,

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,511
I shall give you a fantastic reward!

25
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,411
I wish you all good luck!

26
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:39,811
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

27
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,811
are slashed by the light of deduction.

28
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,711
A large premise full of tricks.

29
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,811
The shocking reason why Kogoro was targeted.

30
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,411
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,411
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,811
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:26,462
"The Secret of the Kogoro Mouri Statue"

34
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,368
As always, what a magnificent yard.

35
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:36,368
That's true. It looks like an entire town is included in the yard.

36
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:40,768
Actually, we call it a town instead of a yard.

37
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,568
It's great for playing hide-and-seek.

38
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,068
We've got him! That supposed to be a dead end!

39
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,668
Mr. Kataoka disappeared.

40
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:59,668
Impossible.

41
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,068
This is...

42
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,268
Did you figure something out, Conan?

43
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:19,168
Don't you think this clock is strange?

44
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,368
The position of the clock is too low

45
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,968
and the hour hand and the minute hand are both pointing at six.

46
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,368
That is strange, isn't it?

47
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:28,668
That makes sense.

48
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,968
Could it be...

49
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,068
You were right, this is the entrance to the underground passage!

50
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:45,068
It hurts...

51
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:49,668
Thief K!

52
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:50,968
Hold it!

53
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:55,868
-I'm sorry, dad. -I'll head over to the exit!

54
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,268
We can trap him in from both sides!

55
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,368
-Okay! -Okay!

56
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,068
These are...

57
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:13,068
These footprints in the mud are still new.

58
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,868
No doubt he went this way.

59
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:20,568
Ran, over there!

60
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,368
We found him!

61
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,968
Master, we got you!

62
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,968
I'm sorry, how awkward of me.

63
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,668
Hurry up and get down, then!

64
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,668
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,768
What? If we go this way...

66
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:46,768
Yes, it leads to the point where we started from,

67
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,768
the front of the residence.

68
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:57,268
It seems that he is heading to the backyard!

69
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,068
You two go around from that side!

70
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,968
We can trap him for sure this time.

71
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,568
Okay!

72
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,668
Gosh! This residence is too large!

73
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,668
He went to your way! Catch him!

74
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:23,968
Conan, let's go!

75
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,068
All right!

76
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,568
Watch out!

77
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,568
Isn't it against the rules to ride a bike?

78
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,968
Well, sort of...

79
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:50,968
This place is like a maze!

80
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,868
How can we tell where he went?

81
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:55,768
This way!

82
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,668
It hurts...

83
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,368
Are you all right?

84
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,568
Yes, I happened to bump into him all of a sudden,

85
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:10,268
I just tripped out of surprise.

86
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:11,768
Where is Mr. Kataoka?

87
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,868
He probably headed over to the main residence.

88
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,568
7 minutes to go.

89
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,068
Ma'am!

90
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,568
Did you hear that voice just now?

91
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,968
Yes! What happened?

92
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,268
I only just got here too!

93
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:30,868
Don't tell me that something happened to Mr. Kataoka!

94
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,868
Master!

95
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,968
Ran! What about over there?

96
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,668
No, nobody here either!

97
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:46,068
Gosh. Where on earth is he?

98
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,568
What happened?

99
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,668
I heard a loud noise.

100
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,968
Seiya, where were you all this time?

101
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:56,568
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

102
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,668
Master!

103
00:07:58,668 --> 00:07:59,768
Sada?

104
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,568
It's from the backyard!

105
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,968
Master, get a hold of yourself!

106
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:09,168
Master!

107
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:12,768
What's the matter? Did something happen?

108
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,068
Well...

109
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,068
Move!

110
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:27,368
This is bad. He's dead.

111
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:35,974
The deceased is the master of this residence,

112
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,774
a man of great wealth, Eisuke Kataoka, age 54.

113
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:42,774
There's been a great impact to his back.

114
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,774
The most severe wound was on the back of his head,

115
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,974
which we believe to be the fatal wound.

116
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:52,174
The time of his death can be determined to be 5:55pm.

117
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:58,974
Everyone here heard Mr. Kataoka's scream and the ladder falling.

118
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:03,174
Mr. Kataoka was in the middle of playing a game with all of you?

119
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,774
Yes, we were playing hide-and-seek.

120
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,474
We were chasing him.

121
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:10,374
What a thing to do at your age.

122
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:11,974
Well...

123
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,974
Was it an accident?

124
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,974
Yes. Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints were found on the ladder.

125
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:26,874
Mr. Kataoka probably lost his balance

126
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:30,274
when climbing the ladder and fell off.

127
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,674
I expect that's how it happened.

128
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:34,474
The bruise on his cheek

129
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:38,874
probably got there when he fell off the ladder too.

130
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,974
He asked for it!

131
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:44,574
It's because he never outgrew playing such a game.

132
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:46,474
She is Mr. Kataoka's wife.

133
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,974
It seems that he remarried three years ago

134
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:50,974
after his previous wife passed away.

135
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:56,774
What? You're not wearing your wedding ring, ma'am?

136
00:09:56,774 --> 00:10:00,674
I haven't been wearing it for some time because it's too trouble.

137
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:03,674
But, why is there a trace of a ring...

138
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:08,374
Is he the son of the previous wife?

139
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,174
Yes. It seems that he had a grudge against Mr. Kataoka,

140
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:15,874
saying that his father's reckless ways killed his mother.

141
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:18,274
Well, it's a very appropriate way for him to die like this.

142
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,874
What?

143
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:23,274
Seiya, what happened to your hand?

144
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:27,474
What? Oh, I hurt it with a guitar string a while ago.

145
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,974
What? But back then, didn't he say...

146
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,274
What happened?

147
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,574
I heard a loud noise.

148
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:36,974
Seiya, where were you all this time?

149
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:39,974
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

150
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:46,674
I'm sorry for causing all of you trouble.

151
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,474
But I wonder if this is really an accident.

152
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,474
What?

153
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,474
Is anything bothering you, Mouri?

154
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,174
When Mr. Kataoka challenges me,

155
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:00,074
he always sets up a lot of tricks.

156
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:03,674
But all he did this time was run and flee.

157
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:05,874
Aren't you overthinking this?

158
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,874
He's an amateur, that would happen too.

159
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:12,274
Well, I guess so.

160
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,274
So, this really was an accident.

161
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,274
I guess so.

162
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,974
No, he is right.

163
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:21,974
There are several points that are strange to be an accident.

164
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:25,274
First, the corpse hadn't been sweating.

165
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:29,174
Despite the fact that he should've been running until just before he died.

166
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:30,674
Besides that...

167
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:38,574
Don't tell me this place...

168
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,974
If so... over there?

169
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,674
It should be somewhere around here.

170
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,574
As expected, this is...

171
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:01,374
What's with you?

172
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,274
Looking at me like you saw a monster or something.

173
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:05,974
Everyone's been shouting and looking for you!

174
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,874
What? Then why back then...

175
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:13,874
This is the favourite song of the late Mr. Kataoka.

176
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:16,574
I guess someone's playing it at the main residence

177
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,574
to mourn his death.

178
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:21,574
Pops, can you try moving this statue?

179
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,474
What? It's a statue.

180
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,974
What makes you think I can move it?

181
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:28,374
Don't you think there's something strange about this statue?

182
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,674
What?

183
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:32,574
Your mustache that's not supposed to be connected

184
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:33,974
is actually connected.

185
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,174
It looks like it's a fake.

186
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:39,874
What?

187
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,474
Is this it?

188
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,974
What? There's nothing here.

189
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,274
That sound...

190
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,274
I get it!

191
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,474
What?

192
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,474
Lend this to me for a while, okay?

193
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:05,274
I see, so that's what happened.

194
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,674
What?

195
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:09,674
What're you doing here, Conan?

196
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:14,274
Officer Takagi, Pops asked me to do this.

197
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:17,374
What? But Mr. Mouri's over there.

198
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:19,374
It's okay...

199
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:25,174
Pops! I brought everyone over just like you told me to.

200
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:28,474
What on earth is this about, Mouri?

201
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,474
I've finally figured it out.

202
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:34,874
The truth behind this murder disguised as an accident.

203
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:40,574
But the crime scene has all the signs of an accident!

204
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,974
Why do you think it was murder?

205
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:44,074
The bruise.

206
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,274
The bruise? Do you mean the bruise on the corpse?

207
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:50,574
He got it when he fell off the ladder, isn't it?

208
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:52,874
That's what I thought at first.

209
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,674
But this statue helped me get at the truth.

210
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,574
Please take a good look.

211
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,474
Its nose is chipped, you see that?

212
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,974
It certainly is. But...

213
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,974
The nose is chipped not long ago.

214
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:09,474
It's as if something hit it with a lot of force recently.

215
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,674
It couldn't be...

216
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:14,574
Yes. Everything should come to light after re-investigation.

217
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,274
The bruise on the corpse's cheek

218
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,274
was made after it hit the nose of the statue.

219
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,774
But the corpse was found...

220
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:22,974
Yes.

221
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:26,574
If Mr. Kataoka really fell off the ladder,

222
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,274
he couldn't have hit this statue that is so far away.

223
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:34,974
Exactly. Mr. Kataoka didn't fall off the ladder.

224
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:39,674
First, he was struck and passed out by the killer here.

225
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,274
Then, he was carried over to the place where his body was found.

226
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:45,574
And the killer murdered him by hitting his head and body

227
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,774
against the stone paving.

228
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:51,774
After that, the killer put Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints on the ladder

229
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,174
and put the ladder beside the corpse

230
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:57,974
to make everyone believed that Mr. Kataoka fell off the ladder.

231
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,574
But who would do that?

232
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:04,274
There's something I'd like to confirm before that.

233
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,574
Officer Takagi!

234
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:10,474
Was the edge of Mr. Kataoka's cape torn?

235
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,474
No, it wasn't.

236
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:15,974
Don't you think it's strange, Ran?

237
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:16,974
I get it!

238
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,874
What do you mean?

239
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:22,174
Mr. Kataoka's cape was supposed to be ripped!

240
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,274
Watch out!

241
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:32,674
But, the cape the corpse was wearing wasn't torn.

242
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,674
But why?

243
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,574
The answer is simple.

244
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:40,574
It's because the person you were going after wasn't Mr. Kataoka!

245
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,474
-What? -What?

246
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,074
Of course, the first Thief K that we were chasing was Mr. Kataoka.

247
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:50,674
But, someone took over his place part way,

248
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:53,074
the killer switched with Mr. Kataoka.

249
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,374
Isn't that right? The other Thief K,

250
00:15:56,374 --> 00:16:00,174
as well as the one who killed Mr. Kataoka...

251
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:02,574
Mr. Makoto Sada!

252
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:08,874
But Mr. Sada was with us while chasing after Mr. Kataoka.

253
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,874
I don't think he had time to switch with Mr. Kataoka.

254
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:13,874
No, you weren't always with him.

255
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,174
There was one time you parted ways,

256
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,574
just before you came to this backyard.

257
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:22,574
You two go around from that side!

258
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,274
We can trap him for sure this time.

259
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,974
Okay.

260
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:29,274
This was probably Mr. Kataoka's idea to begin with.

261
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:33,774
He probably had that switching plan for our game.

262
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:36,574
But, Mr. Sada's purpose

263
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:41,674
was to take advantage of this trick and kill Mr. Kataoka.

264
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,174
After watching Ran and Conan go off,

265
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,174
he took a short cut into the residence

266
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:49,674
and wore the outfit of Thief K that he had prepared beforehand,

267
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:55,274
then attacked Mr. Kataoka who was waiting for him from behind

268
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,474
and hid him in the shade of the statue.

269
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,674
After that, Mr. Sada appears before Ran and Conan as Thief K!

270
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,774
Then, the one we were chasing after...

271
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,974
It wasn't Mr. Kataoka but Mr. Sada.

272
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,274
I confirmed with the kid a while ago.

273
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,574
Thief K's shoes were supposed to be muddy

274
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:12,974
because he ran through the underground passage,

275
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:17,074
but the pedal of the bike was clean.

276
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:20,174
Then, Mr. Sada removed that outfit

277
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,674
and act as if nothing had happened.

278
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,974
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten something very important!

279
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,174
I heard Mr. Kataoka's scream

280
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:32,674
and the sound of the ladder falling together with Ran and Conan.

281
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,974
Are you referring to this?

282
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:37,174
Officer Takagi!

283
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:38,574
Yes, sir!

284
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:49,174
No doubt about it. That's the voice and noise we heard!

285
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,974
It was the sound from the stereo.

286
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:55,374
Mr. Sada recorded Mr. Kataoka's voice

287
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,474
and the sound of the ladder falling into a CD beforehand

288
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:02,874
and used a timer to set it so that it would play

289
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,874
at that time at top volume.

290
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:10,174
But, Mr. Kataoka was still alive at the time.

291
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,474
He is hidden in the shade of this statue.

292
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,174
Don't tell me that it was when we went into the residence

293
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,374
to look for Mr. Kataoka...

294
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:22,374
Yes, Mr. Sada came to the backyard and killed Mr. Kataoka.

295
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:26,474
Then he schemed a plan to deceive everyone.

296
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,674
He also carried Mr. Kataoka's corpse

297
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,974
because he wanted to deceive everyone

298
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,674
about the blood that had splattered on his clothes.

299
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,174
Isn't that right?

300
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:39,974
Mr. Sada, your mistake is by setting the stereo volume too high.

301
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:43,974
The sound was so loud that it reached us, who were at a distance,

302
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:47,174
as well as Seiya who was listening to music using headphones.

303
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:50,674
In fact, the voices of people are not audible at such distance.

304
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:53,574
But what are you trying to imply?

305
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,774
That doesn't serve as proof.

306
00:18:55,774 --> 00:18:58,674
You are right. So, let me show you something now.

307
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:02,574
A conclusive proof that you are the killer.

308
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,974
After you had finished your act,

309
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:10,774
I'm sure you had to hide your outfit

310
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,974
somewhere at the crossroad with a bronze statue.

311
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:16,774
In fact, a hidden hole was found in the pedestal of the statue,

312
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:18,874
but it was empty.

313
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,274
Of course.

314
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,274
Yes, because that place was used only

315
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:26,974
to hide something that you needed in order to hide your outfit.

316
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:33,574
Back then, you hid your outfit in the thing you took out of the hole!

317
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:49,674
Don't you think this ball is strange?

318
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:53,974
It seems a bit too large and it's making a strange sound.

319
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,874
This is...

320
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:05,274
A piece of cracked marble.

321
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:07,674
Although slight, there's blood on it.

322
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,974
There's gray hair on the wig too.

323
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:13,674
What is this, Mr. Sada?

324
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,274
Back then,

325
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:19,274
you took that ball out of the hole of the pedestal,

326
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:22,274
hid the outfit in it

327
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:25,574
and threw it in a blind spot from Ran and Conan.

328
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:29,474
You were probably planning to retrieve it later.

329
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:31,674
But, you miscalculated two things.

330
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:37,574
The first was the stray cat rolled the ball somewhere.

331
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:42,574
And the second was the chipped piece of the marbled nose

332
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:47,274
that you had to hide was making strange noises from the ball.

333
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:50,574
No, my biggest miscalculation was

334
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:53,974
underestimating your deduction skills, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:54,974
You mean...

336
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:58,974
Yes, I'm the one who killed Mr. Kataoka.

337
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,874
-But... -Why?

338
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:03,974
I couldn't forgive him.

339
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:07,474
He lived a capricious life

340
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:12,574
as if he had forgotten all about his late wife.

341
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:15,174
I felt sorry for his late wife.

342
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,474
You're wrong.

343
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,674
What?

344
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:22,874
The only things he loved were detectives and his late wife.

345
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:26,674
Although it seemed he married me to get rid of his sadness,

346
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:30,274
I couldn't fill his empty space no matter how much I tried.

347
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:33,874
I only just realised the truth recently.

348
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:37,874
That's why you took off your marriage ring.

349
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,674
It was just an act of slight protest.

350
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,674
But, he didn't even notice it.

351
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,574
I see.

352
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,974
Master did love his wife.

"Mouri Detective Agency"

354
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:18,874
So, is this the reward that Mr. Kataoka had ready?

355
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:25,174
I guess he truly was a fool to make something like this!

356
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:30,274
I just enjoyed taking on his challenges.

357
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,674
Dad.

358
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:35,674
So...

359
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:37,974
What're you going to do with this?

Hey... Don't tell me...

Conan?

363
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:50,274
I told you, we came to get Conan's clothes,

364
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:53,674
and found that Matsunosuke asleep!

365
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:56,174
Everybody's made a mistake.

366
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:59,274
Even the witness and the murderer too.

367
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:01,174
I see!

368
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,674
I get the picture.

369
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,174
