1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:03,278
Iron Badger the great safe

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:05,478
at the residence of Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki,

3
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:07,978
is the impregnable great safe

4
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:09,778
that the great puppeteer of the days of Tokugawa,

5
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:12,778
Kichiemon Samizu had made.

6
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:17,578
Thief Kid sends a letter of challenge against Iron Badger.

7
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:19,478
He says that he will open the door of Iron Badger

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,378
that no thief has ever been able to open before.

9
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:26,478
However, because of the weight sensor that works in link

10
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:29,478
with the security device that Jirokichi had installed it is really tough,

11
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:31,978
even to try to get close to it.

12
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,978
On the day the crime was to be carried out,

13
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:39,278
Inspector Nakamori and his men secure the area with tight security

14
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:40,778
but, as if to despise the device,

15
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:43,578
in the room where the safe is, equipped with sensor and all,

16
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,078
Thief Kid's second letter of challenge is found there.

17
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:52,078
How on earth did he make it through the weight sensor?

18
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:55,678
Has Thief Kid already snuck into the house?

19
00:00:55,678 --> 00:01:00,678
And how does he propose to open the door of Iron Badger?

20
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:04,678
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

21
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:07,178
Saturday nights are for mystery.

22
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:09,178
An unexpected treasure is found in the safe.

23
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:11,278
Thief Kid finally shows is identity!

24
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,878
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,578
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:17,078
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:56,338 --> 00:03:02,338
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 2)"

28
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,700
Did you find Thief Kid?

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
No, not yet.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't think you should walk through this corridor.

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Why not?

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,100
Because you'll be suspected as being Thief Kid.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Thanks to this brat!

35
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,400
Well, that puts me in a fix.

36
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I was told to deliver this meal to master.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
To Uncle?

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,400
I just came here so I didn't know but...

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,800
it seems he recently eats just his dinner alone in his study.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,700
And, for some reason, it seems that

42
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,900
when the dishes are taken from his study after dinner,

43
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,700
two dishes are always missing.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,500
Why would the dishes disappear?

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
-I wonder. -The strange things

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,900
are not just the dinner and the missing dishes.

47
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,100
It seems that he goes into the safe room to check the safe.

48
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,900
I hear that he always has a cane with him at that time too.

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,400
You mean, Uncle who's almost always too energetic for his age?

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Yes.

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,400
It's most likely that he can't open the safe

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
unless he has that cane and dishes.

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
No matter if the safe is guarded by a security device

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
that works in link with a weight sensor

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
that reacts to even one cigarette,

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,200
there's no point if the safe itself opens really easily.

57
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm out of cigarettes.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,300
-Ms. Seto. -Yes?

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,200
The extension rang a while ago.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Mr. Akitsu!

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,900
Oh, yes?

62
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm sorry to bother you, but would you go buy me cigarettes?

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
All right.

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,900
I got a call from master a while ago,

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,500
asking if his dinner's not ready yet.

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
Okay, I'll deliver it to him!

67
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,300
Right away!

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,700
I'm sorry!

70
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,000
No problem.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Just what's taking you so long?

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Hurry and bring my dinner!

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,200
Yes, right away, sir!

74
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,700
They're all wet.

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,000
No problem.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,900
Be it the secretary or the maid,

77
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
hiring two that are totally useless.

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Thank you.

79
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,800
He, the bodyguard is the only one that's dependable!

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
What did you want with me?

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
What do I want?

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh, didn't you say

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,800
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh, that's right.

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,500
First, let's go to the room!

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,700
What?

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
You're going to stop the security device?

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,200
When Thief Kid may be coming?

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Yeah, that's right!

91
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
It's daily routine for me

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,000
to check inside the safe, you see!

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,300
I hope he's not Thief Kid.

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,300
Well, I'll be done in two or three minutes!

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,500
Don't you dare look inside till then!

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,700
The more I want to look when told not to.

97
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
No!

98
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, I thought so too.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,200
And, can you also be quiet?

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Advisor is making a call, you see.

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,300
A call?

102
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,200
He's always talking to someone inside!

103
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,000
He could be talking to himself, though.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,500
Don't tell me that he forgot how to open the safe

105
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,600
and is asking somebody how to do it.

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,700
I wonder.

107
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,000
Advisor Suzuki recently eats dinner alone in his study.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,900
And for some reason two dishes disappear.

109
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,400
When he goes to check the safe room later,

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,900
he, for some reason brings a cane,

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
and talks to someone while doing the check.

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Moreover, that weird letter of challenge.

113
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
It can't be?

114
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,200
Conan!

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Dinner's ready!

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
Okay, the check's over!

117
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,400
You can do what you like now!

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Before you go back to your room,

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,600
may I check your body as well as the contents inside your bag?

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,100
Yeah, I guess, why not?

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,200
By the way, what's in the bag?

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,600
Not much.

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,300
Just an old album,

124
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
and a composition that I wrote,

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,900
and a picture that I drew when I was a child.

126
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,800
I have this urge to take it to my room and look at them sometimes.

127
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
It's true that there's only an album inside the bag.

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, right,

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm going out now, but don't bother with me.

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I had completely forgot that

131
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I promised to have a meal with Mr. Chaki!

132
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
With Superintendent Chaki?

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
Here's the car key!

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,400
Park the car in the back.

135
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,500
Well, I guess me not being here will not be a problem!

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,700
Because this little genius his arch rival is here!

138
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll leave the rest to you, little genius!

139
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,500
Yep!

140
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,200
Announcing to all men guarding the Suzuki residence.

141
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,500
It's already time that Thief Kid announced that he'd be coming!

142
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,800
Remember, stay on guard all of you!

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,700
Don't be off your guard even when seeing a familiar face!

144
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,200
The man next to you may be Thief Kid!

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,100
After all, he's a master of disguise!

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I wonder who he's disguised as. Thief Kid.

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,800
That brat was giving his piece of mind a while ago saying that,

148
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,400
the one who can place the letter of challenge in there

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,900
when the security device was turned off the first time is

150
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
the tanned bodyguard, Goto,

151
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,000
the sort of dense secretary, Akitsu,

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,800
and the klutzy maid, Mizuki.

153
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,500
Well, that bodyguard is clear!

154
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,600
He went out a while ago with Uncle Jirokichi, besides.

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,100
Then, is it either Mr. Akitsu or the maid?

156
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,600
It could be Akitsu.

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,700
He hasn't been around ever since he went out to buy my cigarette.

158
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,800
But, the maid seemed to be acting deliberately klutzy too.

159
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,700
There's one more suspicious person!

160
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,900
You know, Uncle Jirokichi!

161
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,000
What?

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
If your Uncle is Thief Kid,

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,700
he has the switch to the security device,

164
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,500
so it would be easy for him to put the letter of challenge there, right?

165
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,700
I guess so, but...

166
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,800
You didn't say that before!

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,100
I just realized it now.

168
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,400
Besides, when you scattered the coins,

169
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,900
Uncle Jirokichi picked them up and threw them to you, right?

170
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah.

171
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,100
Which hand did he throw it with?

172
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,500
I think it was his right hand.

173
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Then which hand did Uncle Jirokichi throw

174
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,700
the car key that he threw to the bodyguard with?

175
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,500
If I remember correctly...

176
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,300
His left hand!

177
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Hey, is that true?

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,400
Yep, back then

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,100
he took the key from his chest pocket using his right hand

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,300
and shifted it over to his left hand

181
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,600
when threw it to the bodyguard.

182
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,100
That's why I thought it was strange.

183
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,000
You mean, he's Thief Kid inside?

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,900
Then, shouldn't you tell Inspector Nakamori about this right away?

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,500
If they go after him now, they may still be able to catch him!

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Right!

187
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,000
What? That old man may be Thief Kid?

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
No darn way!

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,100
But Advisor Suzuki switched off the security device a while ago

190
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,600
and went inside the safe room, didn't he?

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,500
Yeah, he went in there to do a routine check of the safe!

192
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
And, we did a full body check

193
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,400
as well as check the bag that he had,

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,000
but found nothing suspicious!

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Besides, that old man went out with Superintendent Chaki just now

196
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,500
to grab a bite to eat!

197
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,900
So, how the heck could he be Thief Kid?

198
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
What about me?

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,400
Superintendent Chaki?

200
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,500
Aren't you supposed to be having dinner with Advisor Suzuki?

201
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
You idiot!

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,100
Why would I be doing something easygoing like that

203
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,800
at a time like this?

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,100
I went to the master's room to retrieve the dishes after dinner

205
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,400
and found that the closet door was opened slightly,

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,900
so I looked inside.

207
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,200
And found master was tied and sleeping inside!

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Then, the old man that just left was...

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,500
Inspector!

210
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
I just checked.

211
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,200
I found many steel wires set up with a sign written,

212
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,400
"Danger, do not touch."

213
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Therefore, it's hard to do anything.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's ridiculous,

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,400
the time that old man came into this room

216
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
was just for two to three minutes.

217
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
Thief Kid?

218
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,800
"This is to confirm that I have searched inside Iron Badger". It says?

219
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
I see.

220
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,300
He was only after opening the door of the safe to begin with anyway.

221
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,800
So, he already carried out what he was planning to do?

222
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
How dare he?

223
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, I think it'd better not to go inside!

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,600
If it were Thief Kid,

225
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,200
I think he'd leave the security switched on.

226
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,100
Okay, Squad A get together with the bomb disengaging squad

227
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
and head on to rescue Mr. Suzuki!

228
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,100
All the rest of you, go after that guy and nab him!

229
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,400
It seems a bit boisterous behind us.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Never mind, let them be.

231
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,700
I assumed it would turn out this way.

232
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,759
Until just a while ago, there were so many squad people here...

233
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,659
It seems to have been a dream.

234
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,959
They still seem to be taking rescue procedures in Uncle's room.

235
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,959
But to think that Uncle was Thief Kid,

236
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,059
I should've talked to him a lot more.

237
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,359
About that, somehow doesn't something bother you?

238
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,659
The first one who switched off the security device

239
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,759
and put the letter of challenge there

240
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,659
was Thief Kid, right?

241
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,759
But, the Jirokichi that picked up the coins later

242
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,059
was the real one.

243
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,659
The last one who threw the car key

244
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,659
was Thief Kid, right?

245
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,759
It sure is weird.

246
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,759
The real one came after Thief Kid

247
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,659
and the last one again is Thief Kid.

248
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,059
I wonder when they switched.

249
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:10,559
Hey, Conan, don't you think it's weird too?

250
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,059
He's gone again!

251
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,259
Well, that guy's Thief Kid, the magician under the moon.

252
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,259
So I'm sure he worked something ingenious out.

253
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,359
Hey, when you find that brat, we'll get ready to head on home!

254
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,259
Talk about no fun.

255
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,059
You really like to...

256
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,159
disguise yourself as a woman, don't you?

257
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,759
It's just so much more cute this way.

258
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,259
When did you figure it out?

259
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:53,059
Until the time you were urged to hurry and take the dinner to him

260
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,159
and you rushed to take it, then hit Pops in the rear end,

261
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,259
you were probably acting out being a klutz.

262
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,659
But, Pops dropping his coin purse from the impact

263
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,959
and the coins scattering all around were not what you expected.

264
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,759
Since you carelessly were not ready for this,

265
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,359
and couldn't afford picking the coins up with your bare hands,

266
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,159
but thought it unnatural not doing anything

267
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,059
and ignoring the situation,

268
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,059
so you spilled the water, right?

269
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,859
If the coins are wet,

270
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:23,759
even if you pick the coins up wiping them with a handkerchief,

271
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,859
it wouldn't look all that strange!

272
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,959
You figured out that I was Thief Kid with only that much info?

273
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,759
That word that you told the advisor!

274
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,559
Oh, didn't you say

275
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,659
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

276
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,659
That's when I figured out

277
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:50,359
the mystery of the first letter of challenge!

278
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,359
If you read the sentences in that letter

279
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,159
by connecting the letters on the very bottom from the left,

280
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,459
it reads, "Give me a helping hand!"

281
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,759
In other words, that letter of challenge

282
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,259
was something that the advisor himself had written

283
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,959
to Thief Kid asking for help!

284
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,359
You disclosed your identity to the advisor with that phrase,

285
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,959
was told in this room about the strategy

286
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,659
to get the squad men out of here, right?

287
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,259
You let him throw the key with his left hand,

288
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,759
made him lie about the dinner with the Superintendent

289
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,459
that would be disclosed in no time at all

290
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,959
and made him post the card of Thief Kid on the safe.

291
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,859
All to give people the illusion that the advisor was Thief Kid.

292
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:33,259
Is the man tied up in the closet.

293
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:38,959
Mr. Akitsu who was put to sleep and disguised as the advisor?

294
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,359
You seem to be having a tough time.

295
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,659
Do you want help?

296
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,359
The door behind you.

297
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,459
It looks like something's poked onto it

298
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,859
a lot of times, doesn't it?

299
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,759
Yeah.

300
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,559
I'm pretty sure that if I turn this dial carelessly...

301
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,059
See?

302
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,359
So I guess you should leave things up to a professional!

303
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:25,159
Hey. Aren't the tiles over there strangely new?

304
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,459
See, over here.

305
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,459
Just as would be expected

306
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:43,059
of a great safe that was made by the genius maker of gadgets, Kichiemon.

307
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,659
"You lose" -I don't need this, though.

308
00:18:56,459 --> 00:19:00,859
Then, you already know why I was called here, right?

309
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,459
After all, you chased the police away

310
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,559
knowing that it was my strategy.

311
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,059
Yeah, from the recent strange actions of the advisor.

312
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,359
He started eating dinner in his own room every night

313
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,559
to get fresh water.

314
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,559
He took two dishes that was served at dinner

315
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,859
and used one for water and the other to put dog food in.

316
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:28,159
And, he used his cane to push the two dishes

317
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,359
under the space beneath the safe!

318
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,559
He would say things like, "Just a little while more."

319
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,659
Yeah!

320
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:49,259
He did it for the unfortunate one that was swallowed by Iron Badger.

321
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,359
Him, over here!

322
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,359
Hey, cut it out!

323
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,659
According to the old man, it's written on the back of the bandana.

324
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,459
The way to open this Iron Badger!

325
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:12,159
He used to open Iron Badger each time by reading it.

326
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,359
Then, just as I thought...

327
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,159
Yeah, he found out that his dog Lupin wasn't around

328
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,959
after he closed the door of this safe.

329
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:25,959
So, having no choice, he came crying to me for help!

330
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:30,159
The only one who can open this crazy safe in a short time is...

331
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,959
None other than me, Thief Kid, you see!

332
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,959
Like I've been telling you!

333
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,259
I'm the real Jirokichi Suzuki!

334
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:47,759
Liar!

335
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,759
Superintendent Chaki said

336
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,859
he made no promise to go have dinner with you!

337
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,259
It's not Chaki!

338
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,759
I promised to see an old friend called Chiaki, you idiot!

339
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,559
Chiaki?

340
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,459
Which means that Thief Kid is still in that house?

341
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,259
So, they've finally found out that the old man is real and came back.

342
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,959
You're sure reckless, though.

343
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,959
One false move, and you'd be nabbed.

344
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,859
Yeah. At first I thought it was a trap,

345
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,959
but after sneaking in and finding out the reason,

346
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,759
I decided to give him a hand.

347
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,759
All thieves are great fans of "Gentleman Thief", you see.

348
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,659
I felt sorry for Lupin being held captive in the dark behind bars,

349
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,159
so I decided to lend a hand.

350
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,759
What a snob, like always.

351
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,359
Don't get too attached to me.

352
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,359
I mean, you're my enemy, because of your name, you see.

353
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,759
What? Lupin was locked up in that safe?

354
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,959
And, he made Thief Kid open it for him?

355
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,659
It's supposed to be a secret, though.

356
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:37,559
I guess, that old man owes Thief Kid one, now.

357
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,959
Yes. He was saying he had to thank him.

358
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,959
After handcuffing both his hands!

359
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,659
That's what he said.

360
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,859
Oh, I see.

361
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,059
Just as I thought.

362
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,059
What was that gun fire about?

363
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,959
Strange...

364
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:13,059
The blood is dried.

365
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,959
I also remember too. That right hand...

366
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,859
What's this?

367
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,359
It looks like something crystallized.

368
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,259
