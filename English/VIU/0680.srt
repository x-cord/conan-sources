1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:04,725
Is this the rumored cactus?

2
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,725
It's a cactus called "Golden Barrel"

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:10,325
that takes 50 years to bear flowers.

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:13,325
-What? 50 years? -Yeah.

5
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:14,825
"Zenzo Sunada (66), a wealthy man" -I took care of it

6
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,925
since it was this small, right?

7
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:19,525
After so many years, it grew to be this big

8
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,225
and even blossomed with flowers.

9
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,725
Which means that you were raising it

10
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:28,625
from the time you were about Ran's age?

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,625
Exactly, sonny.

12
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:35,325
Sonoko, you came to see it in the past with your father, you know.

13
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:38,525
Really? I don't remember.

14
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,525
It's not surprising that you don't remember,

15
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,225
since you were still a toddler then.

16
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:48,025
That's why.

17
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:51,125
By the way, where's the flower that you're referring to?

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,125
-It's right there. -Huh?

19
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:58,125
It's enveloped by fluffy bird feather-like thorns at the top.

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,125
The yellow flower.

21
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,725
Really! How cute.

22
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:06,125
I guess...

23
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,825
True.

24
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,425
The vivid colored memories of summer

25
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:14,525
solve mysteries all season round.

26
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,225
In a greenhouse under tight security,

27
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:18,325
there're rare cactuses with stingy thorns.

28
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,025
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,025
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,425
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:09,311
"Cactus Rhapsody"

32
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,211
But what a large number of cactus you have here.

33
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:16,911
I guess you've got some valuable ones here, too.

34
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,111
Aren't you plagued by thieves at times?

35
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:22,711
Well, there's a specially ordered alarm set up here.

36
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,911
At night, I'm the only one who can cancel the alarm,

37
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:29,111
since I have this card.

38
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,111
It's sort of like the automatic wicket at the station.

39
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,311
But, why do you keep it in your pocket?

40
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,511
I keep whatever's important in here,

41
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,911
that way I feel safe.

42
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,111
Dad!

43
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,511
What do you guys want?

44
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,211
We heard from the lawyer!

45
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:52,811
That you changed the will?

46
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,611
Quiet! I've got guests!

47
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,211
Shut up! Tell us what's going on!

48
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,511
I'm not wasting my breath for something like that!

49
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,011
Get out of here.

50
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:03,711
My cactus are going to wither!

51
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,311
No good, Yasuyuki. Let's take care of this later.

52
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,511
Yeah.

53
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,111
You're going to explain this to us later, understand?

54
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:11,411
Gosh!

55
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,911
Really, I tell you...

56
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:17,111
The Golden Barrel finally blossomed, and yet...

57
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,211
Yashiro!

58
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,511
Where are you, Yashiro?

59
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:27,011
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,711
What seems to be the matter, sir?

61
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,111
What the heck is that?

62
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,411
I told you I don't use unglazed pottery planters!

63
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,611
Put it away right this minute!

64
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,811
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,611
What a temper.

66
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,811
Excuse me.

67
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,011
We came at a bad time, didn't we?

68
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,911
He seems to have been known in his younger days as "Zenzo the Ogre"

69
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,811
an aggressive wheeler-dealer.

70
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,911
How embarrassing.

71
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:03,711
I did shout at her, but she's a good worker, that Yashiro.

72
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:06,311
She's a super good cook, too.

73
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,511
Is that right?

74
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:11,611
She's so different from my two sons.

75
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,311
Okay, I'm going back to the house now,

76
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,511
but why don't you all take your time looking around?

77
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,211
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

78
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,011
What're you doing?

79
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,311
Dad.

80
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,711
I'm asking you what you're doing?

81
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,111
What else?

82
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,111
Unluckily, what you're looking for is here.

83
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,511
"Will"

84
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:44,711
Is it true that you're not dividing the inheritance to us?

85
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,911
I've decided to donate everything

86
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,311
to the Botanical Garden along with the cactuses.

87
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,311
What?

88
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:53,611
Not what you expected, eh?

89
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,811
You're going to give your money up

90
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,911
to your cactuses rather than your sons?

91
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,311
Most naturally.

92
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,211
A professional golfer, my foot.

93
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:03,911
All you do is live off me despite being a grown man.

94
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,611
I'm not giving you any money!

95
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:07,211
What?

96
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:11,811
Well, the flower was so small

97
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,011
despite him asking us to come over and look at it, wasn't it?

98
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,511
Not really.

99
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:18,111
He gave us an opportunity to see something really rare,

100
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,811
so we should be grateful.

101
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:23,311
That... I wonder what it is?

102
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:26,011
Isn't it a radiator for the water heater?

103
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,411
I'm sure it's regulating the temperature in the greenhouse.

104
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,811
I know, I know!

105
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,811
If I remember correctly, the temperature's being controlled here.

106
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,211
Hot!

107
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,511
Hey, Sonoko. Are you all right?

108
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:41,711
If so, what do I have to do to get you to go through

109
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,911
with the original will?

110
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,411
I have no intention of reversing the will

111
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,911
unless you succeed my business!

112
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,411
Are you telling me to quit golf?

113
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,711
You're just a third tier player

114
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,111
who's always defeated in the Monday qualifying anyway.

115
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,811
How dare you, saying what you will...

116
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,911
You took the words right out of my mouth!

117
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:01,411
Okay then, I'll do as I please!

118
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,111
You! What're you doing?

119
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,611
Well, you see...

120
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:10,911
I'll bet you came to ask for money as usual.

121
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,311
Same to you!

122
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,011
You won't get away trying to outdo me.

123
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,711
-What? -Please stop!

124
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,611
You're standing in front of your father's room, you know!

125
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:19,611
Who cares.

126
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,811
Shut up!

127
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,011
You come back after a long while,

128
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,811
and all you both do is talk about money!

129
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,011
Wrong. I came because I was worried about you.

130
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:31,411
Don't lie!

131
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,211
I already heard that the import car dealer

132
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:36,311
that you just started is suffering financially!

133
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,111
Worry, my foot.

134
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,811
It's no use fawning upon the great to win his favor.

135
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:46,011
All he has in mind are his cactuses.

136
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,811
No use picking a fight now.

137
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:51,211
Let's cool it for now,

138
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,611
and try convincing him later tonight.

139
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,311
We're back.

140
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,611
After looking through all the plants, I'm kind of hungry.

141
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,611
Really.

142
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:05,811
"It's cake before flowers" is a phrase made just for you.

143
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,611
Conan!

144
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,911
Are you all right?

145
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:13,911
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

146
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,411
-I'm sorry. -Gosh.

147
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,511
I'm really sorry.

148
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,411
This...

149
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:26,311
Thanks.

150
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,911
Ms. Yashiro.

151
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:29,711
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,911
Please bring my dinner to my room.

153
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,411
Yes, sir.

154
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,511
Yasuyuki really changed.

155
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,711
I don't like him.

156
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:44,111
I'm filled.

157
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:46,411
I really ate.

158
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,211
Sonoko, you ate too much.

159
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,911
You took one helping after the other.

160
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,211
I couldn't help it.

161
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,911
When you got the craving, is when to go for it.

162
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,611
Ms. Yashiro.

163
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:56,611
Yes, sir?

164
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:00,211
I'll go out to practice golf for a while.

165
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,711
I'm going to go check on the car that I left back in the garage.

166
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,511
Bye.

167
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,711
Ms. Yashiro, thank you for the dinner.

168
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,611
It was really delicious.

169
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:15,211
Will you please teach me the recipe for that gravy sauce?

170
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,911
Oh? Just who are you going to make it for?

171
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,111
Don't tell me you're making it for your hubby.

172
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:24,311
No. Come off it, Sonoko.

173
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,111
I'm glad that you liked it.

174
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,311
Would you like some coffee now?

175
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:32,311
But we were just thinking of leaving.

176
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,911
Is Mr. Sunada still in the greenhouse?

177
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,411
Yes. Every day from about 20:00 to 21:00,

178
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,511
he spends his time taking care of the cactuses.

179
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,211
Let's go tell him goodbye, then.

180
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:47,011
But I've told not to let anyone in until 20:30.

181
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,511
So, could you wait a little while more?

182
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,611
Okay then, I guess we'll take a eating break here for a while longer!

183
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,311
I wonder if I'll get fat?

184
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,011
Come on, Sonoko.

185
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:59,011
That's nothing new.

186
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,811
Yasuyuki?

187
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,811
Wrong! I didn't do it!

188
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,211
What's the matter?

189
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,611
What's that?

190
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,611
Isn't that the will?

191
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,711
This is...

192
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,511
Don't tell me that...

193
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,711
Mr. Sunada!

194
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,927
Mr. Sunada!

195
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,732
The cause of death seems to be from a fractured skull

196
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,832
from being beaten in the head with a shovel.

197
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,732
The estimated time of death

198
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:42,132
seems to be between 20:00 to 20:30.

199
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:45,032
And who was the first to find the body...

200
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:50,432
Gosh. I sure run into you kids a lot at the scenes of crimes.

201
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:54,132
Hey, tell me about the circumstances when you found the body.

202
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,732
Uh...

203
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:58,832
After dinner, we were chatting in the living room,

204
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,832
when at about 20:00,

205
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:02,232
the sound of the alarm in the greenhouse went off.

206
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:06,532
Then, we went to look together with the housekeeper, Ms. Yashiro.

207
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,932
And saw Yasuyuki there.

208
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,532
You saw Yasuyuki?

209
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:16,432
Yasuyuki was holding Mr. Sunada's will!

210
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,932
Will?

211
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:22,832
It seems that Mr. Sunada recently rewrote the will!

212
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:27,432
Then, right after that, Misa ran into the greenhouse

213
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,332
and when we all followed her inside...

214
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,332
Mr. Sunada was...

215
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:36,532
Hey, let's go interrogate the people involved!

216
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,632
Yes, sir.

217
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:38,732
Like I already told you,

218
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,632
I rushed inside because I heard the alarm

219
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,732
and found Dad lying on the floor!

220
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:46,132
Why were you in the greenhouse

221
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,132
when you said you were going out to practice golf?

222
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,932
That's because Dad texted me to come over.

223
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,932
See!

224
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,332
I see.

225
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,232
You received it at 20:20.

226
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,932
How about the victim's cell phone?

227
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:05,532
Likewise, at 20:20 he texted to Yasuyuki.

228
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:10,332
Which means that the old man was alive till then.

229
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:13,032
And, what about the will?

230
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,432
Weren't you standing in front of the greenhouse holding the will?

231
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,332
Well...

232
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:21,732
I took it from the pocket of Dad who was lying on the ground.

233
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:23,732
Which means that you...

234
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:26,332
Wrong! I didn't do it! Please believe me!

235
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:30,332
This was found near the corpse.

236
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,732
A golf tee!

237
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:34,332
That's Yasuyuki's...

238
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:35,332
Yasuyuki!

239
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,932
Beats me.

240
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,932
Why would something like that be in a place like this?

241
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:42,632
Please believe me! I didn't do it!

242
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:44,832
I didn't kill Dad!

243
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,332
Please believe me!

244
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,332
After being texted to come here by the victim,

245
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:52,032
you pretended to go practice golfing

246
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,232
and headed for the greenhouse.

247
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,732
The victim let you in,

248
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:58,932
but you got into an argument with him concerning the will.

249
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,332
You lost your temper and picked up the shovel that was by you

250
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:04,432
and beat Mr. Sunada to death!

251
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:09,232
You took the will to gain inheritance, then fled.

252
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:14,632
Back then, the alarm sensed you and it went off!

253
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:17,132
-Isn't that what happened? -No way.

254
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,232
Inspector Yokomizo.

255
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,232
Mr. Sunada should've had a card

256
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:25,832
to cancel the alarm in his pocket, you know.

257
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:29,132
I wonder why that wasn't taken?

258
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:32,632
If he used it, the alarm wouldn't have gone off, don't you think?

259
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:37,232
It's true that the card to cancel the alarm

260
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,732
was in the victim's pocket.

261
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:43,332
You probably just panicked after beating your Dad up.

262
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,432
-Isn't that right? -There's more.

263
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:47,032
What is it now?

264
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:48,532
There's the planter of the Hairbrush Cactus

265
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,532
on the ground near Mr. Sunada, isn't there?

266
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,032
When we first came in here to look around,

267
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,032
it wasn't on the ground, you know.

268
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:59,032
It was probably knocked over

269
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,732
when the culprit was struggling with the victim!

270
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,532
If so, isn't it strange?

271
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:04,432
What is?

272
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:08,432
Because the soil that spilled out from the planter is super dry.

273
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,632
I wonder if the soil will dry up like that in just an hour or so?

274
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:17,132
Besides, a cactus thorn was poked in by Mr. Sunada's chest.

275
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,132
Never mind already!

276
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:20,532
Just stop keep butting your nose into the investigation, kid!

277
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,032
Off you go!

278
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,732
Okay!

279
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,132
It's withered.

280
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:34,232
Maybe...

281
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,532
This is...

282
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:44,832
I see. So, that's the story.

283
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,532
If so, the culprit is...

284
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,732
definitely her!

285
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:57,532
Why? Why do I have to be arrested?

286
00:14:57,532 --> 00:15:00,832
I'll hear you out at the station.

287
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,932
Cut out your talking and get inside!

288
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,032
Like I've been saying, I didn't do it!

289
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,932
Please believe me!

290
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,732
What's up? Did something happen?

291
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:16,132
No, the thing is... nothing really.

292
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:19,032
But the alarm's ringing!

293
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,532
Sonoko.

294
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,132
What's going on?

295
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,732
Hey.

296
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:33,832
I figured everything out with that alarm just now!

297
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,132
What?

298
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,632
This was an alibi trick

299
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:40,032
carried out by using the alarm device!

300
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:44,832
The crime took place before Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

301
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:46,932
First, at around 20:00

302
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,432
when Mr. Sunada went into the greenhouse,

303
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,232
the culprit snuck in together

304
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,132
and committed the crime.

305
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:59,332
Then, in order to frame Yasuyuki for the crime,

306
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:01,232
something that only he could've possessed,

307
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:04,132
was left behind at the scene of the crime.

308
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:08,032
After that, you used the dead Mr. Sanada's finger

309
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:11,032
to text Yasuyuki to come over

310
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,532
and set it so that the mail would be sent out at 20:20,

311
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:16,332
the time that would validate your alibi.

312
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,632
You preset the mail to go out at the fixed time.

313
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:22,632
That can be checked on by calling the cell phone company.

314
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:26,332
Moreover, the culprit used the alarm cancelling card

315
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:29,932
from Mr. Sunada's pocket and fled from the greenhouse.

316
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,032
Then, the culprit snuck away from us

317
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,732
taking a route that would be a blind spot from the living room

318
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,332
and went in through the backdoor to the house.

319
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:39,432
Then soon...

320
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,632
after you got back to the scene of the crime,

321
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:44,632
you returned the card to his pocket.

322
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:48,232
That's why when Yasuyuki took the will,

323
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,432
he didn't realize that the card was there.

324
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:56,532
Of course not, because the culprit had the card then.

325
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,132
Which means...

326
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:02,132
When the alarm rang, nobody was at the greenhouse.

327
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:05,232
If so, why did the alarm go off?

328
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,932
That's the key to this trick.

329
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,432
The trap that the culprit used taking advantage

330
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,532
of how the alarm system works.

331
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,932
Look on top of that radiator.

332
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:19,432
There is an unglazed pottery planter on it, isn't there?

333
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:21,432
The alarm system of this greenhouse

334
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:24,732
senses the slightest far-infrared ray

335
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:26,932
that is emitted by the human body and goes off.

336
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:31,332
Unglazed potteries as well as ceramics characteristically

337
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:33,832
have a tendency to emit far-infrared rays

338
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:37,032
like does the human body when heated.

339
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,632
The culprit took advantage of this.

340
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:42,332
Will something like that really make the alarm go off?

341
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:44,832
I tried out a small experiment.

342
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,632
I put that planter over there

343
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,232
because Sonoko told me to.

344
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:54,532
I see. That's why the alarm went off a while ago.

345
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,132
This circumstance is exactly the same

346
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:59,732
as when Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

347
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,732
In other words, it splendidly rang.

348
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,832
And there's only one person

349
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,232
that can carry out this crime!

350
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:14,232
Ms. Misa Yashiro.

351
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:16,332
You!

352
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,732
Misa.

353
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:21,032
It's truly and interesting story.

354
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,632
But that's just a deduction, isn't it?

355
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,732
Do you have any proof?

356
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,632
Proof that would indicate that I'm the culprit?

357
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:32,632
When you beat Mr. Sunada to death,

358
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,432
you happened to knock over a cactus.

359
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,732
But you needed to move the cactus

360
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:44,132
that was on the dead man's chest away, no matter what.

361
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:48,132
In order to take the alarm cancelling card away!

362
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,332
Back then,

363
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:53,332
I'm sure that the thorns of the cactus poked into your hand.

364
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,732
Which means, that the one who has traces of wounds from this

365
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,432
is the culprit.

366
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,832
Misa. If you insist on not being the culprit,

367
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:05,432
please show us your hand.

368
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,032
You win.

369
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:15,032
Just as you said, I'm the killer.

370
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:17,132
This is...

371
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,732
But, how did you figure it out?

372
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,932
The cactus told me.

373
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:23,732
What?

374
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:26,532
When I came to the site,

375
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,432
the soil that spilled out of the planter that was knocked over,

376
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,732
was already starting to dry up.

377
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:35,532
Moreover, the flower that was bloomed in the day time,

378
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,632
was for some reason withered.

379
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,032
And that's when it hit upon me.

380
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:42,332
That it had something to do

381
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:45,032
with the temperature here in this greenhouse.

382
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:51,232
And the other key to solving this trick is the planter.

383
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,432
The planter that was once put away after you were scolded,

384
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,732
was for some reason left behind at the scene of the crime

385
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,332
after the crime was committed.

386
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:01,632
That's when I was totally convinced.

387
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:05,132
That you, Misa, are the only one capable of being the culprit.

388
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,232
Because you're the only one

389
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:11,232
who knew where the planter you put away was.

390
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:18,532
I hated Zenzo Sunada.

391
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,732
In his prime years,

392
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:23,632
he ran one company after the other into bankruptcy

393
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:25,432
by his merciless ways

394
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,532
and ran many business owners into committing suicide.

395
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:37,132
One of them was my Father, who raised me by himself.

396
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,932
After Sunada retired

397
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,432
and put out a want ad for a housekeeper,

398
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:47,432
I made up my mind to avenge my Father's death with my own hands.

399
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:51,232
At seeing his sons going after their Father's money

400
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:53,732
and indulging themselves to the max,

401
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:58,132
I decided to put the blame on one of the two sons!

402
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,032
Ms. Yashiro.

403
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,532
At learning suddenly that all of you were coming,

404
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:04,732
it's true that I hesitated

405
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,632
on whether I should go through with my plan or not.

406
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,532
But I only had today.

407
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,932
A day when the whole family would gather together was rare,

408
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:13,732
so I only had today.

409
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,932
I'll hear you out at the station.

410
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,332
Yes, sir.

411
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,332
Misa.

412
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,832
Your feelings of wanted to hate Mr. Sanada...

413
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,732
I sort of understand it.

414
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:32,832
You lost your precious Father, after all.

415
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:36,532
But that doesn't mean

416
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:41,232
you can take a person's life for revenge.

417
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,032
I don't know why, but I'm really sleepy.

418
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,532
But you're really something, Sonoko,

419
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,532
to solve such a difficult case like that!

420
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,432
Really?

421
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:35,532
Well, if this Super Detective Queen of Deductions handles a case,

422
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:38,232
all of them are a piece of cake to solve!

423
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:44,332
Gosh. All you did was sleep.

424
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,632
You not only caught a wink, you know.

425
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,732
Cactus, cactus...

426
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:56,232
"Next Episode" -Train 3's door will now close.

427
00:23:56,232 --> 00:24:00,232
Watch out because Kaitou KID will be on it!

428
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,632
Just kidding.

429
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,832
Next week, we will ride a luxury train.

430
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:05,832
And I'll compete with the queen.

431
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,532
2 hours until the next station.

432
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,432
A big showdown is going to occur,

433
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,832
but the organization is interfering again!

434
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:14,632
Hey. If you do it inelegantly,

435
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,532
the queen of heart won't appear.

436
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,732
Next episode, "The Tearful Crystal Mother"

437
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:22,732
It's arrived. Let's meet up.
