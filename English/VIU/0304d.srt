1
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:05,527
Takagi!

2
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,323
Conan! Hurry, what's next?

3
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:26,722
What? What the...

4
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:29,522
The slightest shake will set the bomb off!

5
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:30,523
Huh?

6
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,822
I was too scared to die after all,

7
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,022
so I cut the rest of the cord and stopped the bomb.

8
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,722
What?

9
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:38,223
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:46,722
Then, you stopped partway through the hint.

11
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:49,322
Yes. With only the letters "EVIT",

12
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:53,322
we can't tell where the other bomb is.

13
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:54,922
Well, it can't be helped.

14
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:58,423
Let's call the rescue squad and have them come rescue us.

15
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:03,322
So, they went chicken after all.

16
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:05,722
The kid's the one who stopped the bomb,

17
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:09,023
but the people will think the police made him stop it.

18
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:12,422
They'll think that the police sacrificed the lives of a lot of people

19
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,623
just to save their own skin.

20
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:23,222
Please listen to the people cheer!

21
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,522
The bomb has safely been stopped!

22
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:28,222
Moreover, the one who disassembled the bomb

23
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:31,922
was boy who was trapped in the elevator!

24
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:34,622
Let's ask the boy some questions then.

25
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:36,523
I'll bet you were scared, sonny?

26
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,723
"The Hero! A Primary Schooler" -Yes!

27
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,822
Shinichi?

28
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:47,022
But the police taught me how to do it really well,

29
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,223
so I had an easy time taking it apart.

30
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,623
Officer Takagi.

31
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,622
Officer Sato.

32
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:59,322
Stupid. Don't blame yourself.

33
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:01,722
Two hours and a half left to go.

34
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,422
Let's go look for the other bomb!

35
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,023
But the thing is...

36
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,122
I'm glad you're okay!

37
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:18,322
I knew you'd do it, Conan!

38
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:20,423
Just as would be expected of my following!

39
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,222
Well, you did right to stop the bomb.

40
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:28,422
It's a silly thing to sacrifice your life

41
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:30,322
for people you don't even know.

42
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:32,523
Yeah, I guess so.

43
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,523
I'm sure that's what the bomber thought, too.

44
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:46,323
Finally, only one more subject to go!

45
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:51,722
What's the matter, Ran? You look depressed.

46
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:55,022
The next subject is your best subject, Japanese.

47
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,222
Yes.

48
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:58,223
I was just thinking that there sure are

49
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,922
a lot of cars going in and out today.

50
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,022
It's probably because they loading the ping-pong table

51
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,822
into the warehouse of the gym in the basement.

52
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,922
It seems that the next ping-pong tournament

53
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,123
is going to be held at our school.

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,922
While they're at it, they should take the space-consuming drum cans

55
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,822
that are inside the warehouse with them, too.

56
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,522
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:18,822
Don't you know?

58
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,322
Because of those 5 big cans.

59
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:24,823
It's so hard to take out the tennis net.

60
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,022
So, they couldn't find it after all.

61
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,722
Well, even if they were to find it now,

62
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,523
they wouldn't be able to evacuate.

63
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,822
There's only 5 seconds left to go.

64
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:45,122
4, 3, 2, 1...

65
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:46,622
0...

66
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,223
Boom!

67
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,922
Why? Why isn't it exploding?

68
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:56,622
Gosh! It can't be helped.

69
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,423
I'll have to set the bomb off with remote control.

70
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm sorry to say that your partner can't talk to you anymore.

71
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,822
The bomb disposal squad secretly went into school quietly taking care

72
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:16,722
not to leave any voices on the wiretap that you set up

73
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,622
and took apart all 5 of the bombs

74
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:22,622
that you set up in the drum cans.

75
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:27,623
You look as if you're wondering how we located the bombs.

76
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,922
We deciphered the code you sent of Toto Tower

77
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:35,422
and the time of bombing as follows.

78
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:38,322
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

79
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:41,522
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

80
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:44,722
No use getting ready a good stopper.

81
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,422
Because I will win in the end."

82
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:49,222
The phrase "Major Leaguer" means

83
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:52,322
to change everything into English.

84
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,022
A good stopper means

85
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:56,922
a pitcher with good earned run average.

86
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,322
Extended game in English

87
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:01,322
is called Extra inning game.

88
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:04,822
The abbreviation of earned run average is ERA.

89
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:10,922
If you remove the no use words "ERA" from the word "EXTRA",

90
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,822
you get "XT".

91
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:16,522
XT is written vertically and when it is "turned over",

92
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,722
it becomes the Japanese Kanji character, "Wen".

93
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:22,022
That's the map symbol that stands for school.

94
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:27,122
And the hint that was displayed on the LCD panel of the first bomb,

95
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:31,222
"EVIT" is the English spelling of "Detective",

96
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:35,523
that is, a part of it, spelled reverse.

97
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,822
And if the Japanese for "Detective" is reversed,

98
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:41,122
it becomes "Teitan".

99
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,922
The school with the name Teitan has a grade school,

100
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,822
intermediate school, high school and university,

101
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:49,622
but the only school where a lot of students gather during winter vacation

102
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:51,722
is only Teitan High School

103
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:54,723
that is holding national trial exams.

104
00:05:55,723 --> 00:06:00,022
You didn't plant a fake bomb at the baseball park

105
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:02,422
is because you wanted to keep everyone's attention away

106
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,922
from the schools with baseball grounds.

107
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:07,022
Well, but I guess you took us lightly

108
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,222
looking through your binoculars from a conspicuous place like this,

109
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:12,823
keeping watch over Teitan High School. You lose this time.

110
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,523
Look out!

111
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,484
Gosh!

112
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,023
-Sato... -Officer Sato!

113
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:49,523
Gosh!

114
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:09,522
No!

115
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,823
Officer Sato!

116
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,622
Wait!

117
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:43,022
I'm not the one...

118
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,722
It's one of those things that occur frequently.

119
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:49,322
I heard it in my head, a child's voice.

120
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:52,322
It told me to kill the police.

121
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:55,123
No, it told me to kill anybody.

122
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,522
Yeah.

123
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,723
That's why it's not my fault.

124
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:06,023
To think that he was killed by a guy like this...

125
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,423
A guy like this!

126
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,223
A guy like this!

127
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,623
Officer Sato!

128
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,823
What do you think you're doing? Don't bother me!

129
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:46,522
No, Officer Sato!

130
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,122
Let me go! Let me go, I said!

131
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,822
To think that he had to die for a guy like that!

132
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,123
So, let me go!

133
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:05,123
Just what do you think you're doing, Officer Sato?

134
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:09,722
Wasn't it you who always said

135
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,722
to contribute to the nation and the citizens

136
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:14,022
with pride and a sense of mission,

137
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,322
never to cringe in fear and hate

138
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,422
and at all times to respect the rights of people,

139
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:23,122
and perform our duties as police officers with justice.

140
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,223
That's what you always said, right?

141
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:34,123
But...

142
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,322
Acting the way you are now,

143
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:40,522
I'm sure that Officer Matsuda will scold you.

144
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:43,422
Stupid...

145
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,123
I want to forget him, but you...

146
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:50,322
Let me forget him!

147
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,823
You idiot!

148
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:02,423
You shouldn't forget him.

149
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:09,423
If it's a precious memory, you shouldn't forget it.

150
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,722
Once a person dies,

151
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:15,323
that person can only live within one's memory.

152
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:19,223
Officer Takagi.

153
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:21,523
Officer Takagi.

154
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,723
Hey! What was that gun shot just now?

155
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:45,622
Well...

156
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:48,122
I fired one warning shot.

157
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:51,022
Don't tell me you wounded him or something?

158
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:53,723
We weren't kissing!

159
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:30,522
But it's really amazing that you stopped it.

160
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:34,022
You had less than 3 seconds to cut the cord, didn't you?

161
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:37,422
I had the wire cutter in hand

162
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,422
in case I figured out the clue midway.

163
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:43,822
Besides, I couldn't afford to let Officer Takagi die.

164
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,622
But you're really something to figure out that

165
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:50,722
just by seeing "EVIT" it's the reverse of "Detective".

166
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,722
You can say that again!

167
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:56,622
Idiot. Of course I'd figure it out.

168
00:12:56,623 --> 00:13:00,922
I've been hoping that it wouldn't be there.

169
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:04,123
I've been hoping from the very start that it wouldn't be there.

170
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:08,622
Hey, Sato.

171
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:11,422
We're going to visit Shiratori at the hospital.

172
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,523
Yes, I'm coming!

173
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:18,923
"Erase message?"

174
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,523
"Deleted."

175
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:30,022
Goodbye, Officer Matsuda.

176
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:31,323
But...

177
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,723
But I won't forget you.

178
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:01,822
"Next Episode" -Are you referring to that Ms. Ujo...

179
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:05,622
The one who used to be the number one comforting actress, Ujo?

180
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:08,823
You mean, I get to see Ms. Ujo in person?

181
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:12,122
You're really her!

182
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,423
Rurippe!

183
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:16,423
Rurippe!

184
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:27,823
