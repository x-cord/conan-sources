Excuse me, but could you keep your voices down,

What a nuisance.

00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:52,672
It was their fault it nearly turned into a murder.

Huh?

27
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:06,812
They seem to hate each other,

Shut up already!

Yeah...

"Major company executive is dead!" -they were referring to.

47
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,612
Yeah. After the president of a major company died,

48
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:13,712
his will disappeared.

49
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,012
I remember now.

50
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:18,612
Weekly magazines were full of stories about the family

51
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:21,112
accusing each other of stealing it.

52

55
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,512
They even made comments on TV.

56
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:31,412
And exacerbated the situation.

57
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:35,212
They even wrote scandalous articles about the arguing family members.

58
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:37,612
Ultimately, the family members clashed,

59

resulting in an attempted murder.

60
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,412
I heard they garnered a lot of criticism and magazine sales fell.

61

And they're still suffering the consequences.

62

63
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:55,913
turned out the worst way possible.

64

We've identified the victim.

65
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:05,412
"Nichiuri Sports Newspaper Company" -Hiroshi Kagazume, 38 years old.

66
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,312
He was a reporter for Nichiuri Sports magazine.

67
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,812
The time of death is between 7 pm and 9 pm.

68
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,012
How did he die?

69
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,412
We're still waiting for the autopsy,

70
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:17,612
but judging by the body's condition,

71
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:21,412
we believe it was cyanide poisoning.

72
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,712
It's likely it was dissolved into the coffee in his travel tumbler.

73
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,212
Was it suicide?

74
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,812
That's what we thought at first, but...

75
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,712
Footprints?

76
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:36,712
Yes. They're not the victim's and they're fairly fresh.

77
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,713
In other words,

78
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:42,413
it's possible someone else was here around the time of death.

79
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,912
Akira Hashizume.

80
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,512
Like the late Hiroshi Kagazume,

81
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,712
you're a reporter at Nichiuri Sports, correct?

82
00:05:56,713 --> 00:06:01,412
Yeah. Anyway, why am I being arrested?

83
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,312
You're not under arrest.

We just want to speak with you as a material witness for now.

85
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,412
Kagazume and I got along like cats and dogs.

86
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:16,712
We always fought. It was a huge nuisance.

87
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:21,412
I'm sure my coworkers have already told you that.

88
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:25,612
So I definitely had a motive to kill him.

89
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:29,512
But you didn't?

90
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,412
Of course not!

91
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:33,012
Then why were your fingerprints found

92
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:36,012
"Travel Tumbler Fingerprint Results" -on the travel tumbler.

93
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,813
"Name: Akira Hashizume" -at the crime scene?

94
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:44,712
Our travel tumblers were identical.

95
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,412
I've accidentally touched it before.

96
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,712
It must've happened then.

97
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,912
Accidentally, you say?

98
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:55,013
We'll be confirming that.

99
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:59,412
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, kid.

100
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:04,012
You're sure Mr. Hashizume took the wrong travel tumbler, right?

101
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,212
Yeah, but...

102
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,212
What is it, Conan?

103
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:11,012
It may have been my imagination,

104
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,312
but it seemed like Mr. Hashizume

105
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:18,112
deliberately took Mr. Kagazume's travel tumbler.

106
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,113
-What? -What?

107
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,012
Is that true?

108
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:27,112
Then if he deliberately left his own poisoned tumbler

109
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,412
and Mr. Kagazume drank from it without knowing...

110
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,112
Yeah, it's murder.

111
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:35,012
But later...

112
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:38,912
Mr. Kagazume listened to what I said.

113
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:42,012
He knew it wasn't his.

114
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,412
But...

115
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,412
You're right. That is weird.

116
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:49,012
We can ask Mr. Hashizume about it.

117
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,013
Well, actually...

118
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:55,112
What? You have an alibi?

119
00:07:55,113 --> 00:08:00,712
Yeah. It was yesterday night from 7 pm to 9 pm, right?

120
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,612
I was...

121
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:08,112
He was staking out a celebrity's affair.

122
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,712
Is there proof?

123
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,112
Yes.

124
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:16,312
"Cheetah Delivery" -He remembered the company name

125
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:21,113
and appearance of the deliveryman who arrived during that time.

126
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,812
We confirmed his story with the delivery company.

127
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,612
It would've been impossible for Mr. Hashizume to be at the crime scene.

128
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:32,812
Mouri, delivery.

129
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,912
Coming.

130
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,712
"Cheetah Delivery" -Hello. I have a package for you.

131
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,612
I'm here at the time you specified.

132
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,312
Okay.

133
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,813
Could it be...

134
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:47,012
This is it. Mr. Hashizume claims he was here,

135
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:52,012
watching that apartment building from 6 pm to 7 am.

136
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:55,912
Conan, did Mr. Mouri really ask you to investigate this place?

137
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,312
Hey, look.

138
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:00,212
What's this?

139
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,513
This is probably from a camera tripod.

140
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,212
Hello?

141
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,512
Yes, thank you for taking my call earlier.

142
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:13,113
What?

143
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,112
So the old man was right.

144
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:23,612
Yeah. The delivery Mr. Hashizume saw had a specified delivery time.

145
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,412
Not only that, but the address was unknown,

146
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,912
and the sender's name on the voucher was made up.

147
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:31,612
Did Mr. Hashizume send it?

148
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:39,312
Yeah. He filmed the delivery using an unmanned camera on a tripod.

149
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,812
During that time, he went to the crime scene.

150
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:45,613
Later he checked the video so he'd have an alibi.

151
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,812
Which means it was premeditated murder.

152
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:56,013
We found the evidence to support it in a surprising location.

153
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:02,713
On the flash drive plugged into the victim's laptop.

154
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:08,712
On it we found a plan to murder...

155
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,012
"Murder Plan"

156
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,313
"By Hiroshi Kagazume"

157
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,413
you, Mr. Hashizume.

158
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,812
The method and alibi trick in it

159
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,512
is exactly as we just described.

160
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,712
"Alibi fabrication" -According to the plan,

161
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:26,612
he meant to "switch out travel tumblers

162
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,312
and return poisoned tumbler to Hashizume".

163
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:31,412
"Exchange tumbler for my own".

164
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:34,212
"Reconcile with a toast".

165
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,013
"Send him to underworld".

166
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:43,112
Later, "claim Hashizume was stressed about lack of progress at work,

167
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:44,812
suggesting suicide,

168
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:49,812
and write obituary about the loss of a rival and friend."

169
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:54,112
He was quite the particular criminal.

170
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,012
Or maybe it was conceit.

171
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,812
Indeed.

172
00:10:57,813 --> 00:11:01,712
What is it? Something's not right.

173
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:06,712
You either accidentally took or stole the victim's flash drive,

174
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,212
and read its contents.

175
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:13,312
You learned of his plan to kill you and became enraged,

176
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:16,012
and decided to murder him using the same method.

177
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:18,312
No.

178
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:23,312
You pretended to accidentally take the victim's travel tumbler home

179
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,612
and poisoned it.

180
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:26,712
No!

181
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:30,512
You invited the victim out so you could return it

182
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,412
and exchanged tumblers with him.

183
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,912
You made him think you reconciled and made him drink it.

184
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:37,613
No...

185
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,212
What?

186
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,313
Huh?

187
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:54,771
"Murder Plan By Akira Hashizume"

188
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:57,271
What is this?

189
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,471
Inspector!

190
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:01,771
It's the murder plan we found

191
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:07,371
on the flash drive we seized from Mr. Hashizume.

192
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,171
His target is the victim, Mr. Kagazume.

193
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,172
What?

194
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:16,571
Both plans were written at nearly the same time.

195
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:21,371
There are also no signs the documents were unlocked and read.

196
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,171
Which means...

197
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:28,271
Yeah. Unbelievably enough, they coincidentally created the same plan

198
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:31,672
"Murder Plan By Akira Hashizume" -to murder the other.

199
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,971
Because they're so alike, huh?

200
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,072
But still...

201
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,871
That's right.

202
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:48,071
I tried to kill Kagazume according to the plan.

203
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:51,971
I fabricated an alibi, poisoned the travel tumbler,

204
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,471
invited Kagazume out and went to meet him.

205
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,271
I'm sure of it.

206
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:57,871
But...

207
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,472
But when I went...

208
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,571
Kagazume was already dead.

209
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:04,572
-What? -What?

210
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,771
He was dead when you got there?

211
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,271
That's absurd.

212
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,571
It's too convenient!

213
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,172
You're right.

214
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,871
But it's true.

215
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,271
I ran,

216
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,171
washed the tumbler,

217
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,071
and threw it away.

218
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:24,371
Quit playing dumb.

219
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:27,772
Who else could have killed him?

220
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,571
Those two...

221
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:33,971
Mr. Mouri thinks they're suspicious?

222
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,271
No.

223
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,271
He just wants to know if they have alibis.

224
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:44,171
We looked into it but it's unclear.

225
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:47,371
Mr. Hosoda was out gathering information alone.

226
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:50,171
Ms. Kuwana was working late in the office by herself.

227
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,771
Neither had anyone to confirm their stories.

228
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:55,372
Oh, really?

229
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:00,971
Pops asked me to do one other thing.

230
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,072
Huh?

231
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:07,471
Re-examine the crime scene?

232
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,471
Is there something bothering Mr. Mouri?

233
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,471
Can you show me the crime scene photos?

234
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,472
Huh?

235
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,272
Yeah, here.

236
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,171
What's this?

237
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,271
It's coffee.

238
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:26,371
We think some coffee spilled from his tumbler when he collapsed.

239
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:31,371
We found the same cyanide in it, so we're fairly certain.

240
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,371
Then shouldn't it be on his pants, too?

241
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,271
Based on the length of his pants,

242
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,471
isn't it strange to only be on his socks?

243
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,771
Now that you mention it,

244
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:42,871
it certainly is odd.

245
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:46,771
How did the victim, Mr. Kagazume, get here?

246
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,771
By car.

247
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,671
He parked on the embankment and walked here.

248
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:53,671
Did you search the inside of the car?

249
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:59,071
Yeah, but we didn't find anything suspicious.

250
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,271
Search it again.

251
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:03,571
Officer Chiba? This is Mouri.

252
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:07,072
There's something I want you to look into.

253
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:12,871
Is it true, Mouri?

254
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:16,071
That you've uncovered the truth behind the case.

255
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:20,872
What? I came here because you said you found new evidence to...

256
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:32,471
Pops! Are you okay?

257
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:35,671
Stand back, Conan.

258
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:37,272
Okay!

259
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,171
Excuse me.

260
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,471
Allow me to explain the truth behind the case.

261
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:48,872
First, Officer Takagi, what did you find in Mr. Kagazume's car?

262
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,371
Right. On the floor of the driver's seat,

263
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,771
we found traces of cyanide.

264
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,671
What?

265
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:00,271
That can only mean one thing.

266
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:05,171
Mr. Kagazume put cyanide in his own tumbler inside his car.

267
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:09,871
And while doing that, he spilled a bit of coffee.

268
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,471
Sitting in the driver's seat

269
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,271
caused the hem of his pants to ride up,

270
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,271
exposing his socks.

271
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,972
It's possible it splashed onto it then.

272
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:23,671
Doesn't that mean they tried to kill each other at the same time?

273
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:27,771
They both had plans to murder the other.

274
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:31,571
Mr. Kagazume meant to murder Mr. Hashizume

275
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,871
by returning a poisoned travel tumbler,

276
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:37,971
but he drank the coffee in the poisoned tumbler he took first.

277
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:43,871
No. Mr. Kagazume drank from Mr. Hashizume's tumbler he had initially.

278
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:48,472
As Mr. Hashizume claimed, they never exchanged tumblers here.

279
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,771
How do you know that?

280
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,071
The fingerprints.

281
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:57,971
Fingerprints? But it was originally Mr. Hashizume's tumbler.

282
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:02,471
It's not strange for Mr. Kagazume's or his own fingerprints to be on it.

283
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:07,471
Yes, but I'm not talking about their fingerprints.

284
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,371
It's Conan's fingerprints.

285
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,671
What?

286
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:12,571
Well...

287
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,271
I actually touched the tumbler.

288
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:18,771
I barely touched it,

289
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,071
so I'm not sure I left a print,

290
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:24,371
but it could serve as evidence.

291
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:28,371
So? What does this mean?

292
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,471
In other words,

293
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:36,471
Mr. Kagazume drank from the tumbler he poisoned himself.

294
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,771
What? Could it be...

295
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,971
No way.

296
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,271
But why?

297
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:43,571
This is...

298
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:45,572
"Will and Testament" -the reason.

299
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:50,271
At Mr. Mouri's instructions,

300
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:53,171
we found this on another one of Mr. Kagazume's flash drives.

301
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,871
It was never revealed publicly in last year's case.

302
00:17:57,872 --> 00:18:02,371
It describes the death of a major company's president.

303
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,071
The disappearance of a will that exacerbated

304
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,671
"The Surviving Family's Darkness!" -an inheritance dispute.

305
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:12,771
How Mr. Hashizume and Mr. Kagazume worked together

306
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,371
then to break into the law office and steal it.

307
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:18,171
"Will and Testament" -And this is his written confession.

308
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,671
What?

309
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:24,071
They wrote articles

310
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,971
mocking the people they enraged.

311
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:31,371
But after the attempted murder,

312
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:35,271
they destroyed the will and never spoke of it again.

313
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:39,171
However, wracked with guilt,

314
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:42,571
Mr. Kagazume suggested to Mr. Hashizume that they reveal the truth.

315
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:43,771
But...

316
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,371
Mr. Hashizume rejected the idea.

317
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:51,272
What we saw in the restaurant was part of that discussion.

318
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:57,371
Rejecting the idea and fearing the truth would come to light,

319
00:18:57,372 --> 00:19:00,871
Mr. Hashizume plotted to kill Mr. Kagazume,

320
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:06,671
without realizing Mr. Kagazume had made his own plans

321
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:08,971
to kill Mr. Hashizume.

322
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,271
Mr. Hashizume and Mr. Kagazume.

323
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:13,471
The murderous intent you felt

324
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,571
due to your similarities grew over years of working together,

325
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,571
eventually becoming murder plots.

326
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:21,471
But you were different in one way.

327
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:23,771
At the very end,

328
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,371
Mr. Kagazume changed his.

329
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:28,771
This is the last time! You'd better not regret it!

330
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,872
Enough already, you hypocrite!

331
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:53,571
Mr. Kagazume realized you deliberately took his tumbler,

332
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:58,471
and realized you'd come up with the same plan.

333
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:01,671
We found signs that some of Mr. Kagazume's data had been erased,

334
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,871
so we restored it.

335
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:09,171
After Mr. Hashizume's death was ruled a suicide,

336
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,772
he wrote that he would also kill himself.

337
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,372
What?

338
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:19,471
He changed his plan

339
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:23,571
to make the remorseless Mr. Hashizume suffer.

340
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,471
And there's one more thing.

341
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,971
Yes.

342
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,671
According to his physician,

343
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:32,072
Mr. Kagazume was sick and had not much time left to live.

344
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,371
After judging himself guilty,

345
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:39,671
he plotted to frame Mr. Hashizume for his own murder.

346
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,271
He may have been going for a double suicide,

347
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:46,471
since you're so similar.

348
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,872
He should've minded his own business.

349
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:52,771
It was a huge scoop!

350
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,771
We did whatever it took

351
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:57,171
to expose the unsightly darkness within people!

352
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,371
We brought lots of things to light!

353
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,571
He should've thanked me!

354
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,272
Don't be absurd!

355
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:09,471
You call yourself a reporter?

356
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:11,471
What did you gain from writing this article?

357
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:15,571
Money? Fame? Think about it.

358
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:19,872
Did your article make a single person happy?

359
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:31,771
I wish Mr. Kagazume had been judged by the law

360
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:35,772
and atoned for his crime instead.

361
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:42,771
That same day, Mr. Hashizume was arrested

362
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:46,071
for the attempted murder of Mr. Kagazume

363
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,572
and stealing the will one year earlier.

364
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:13,371
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad? You must be tired.

365
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:15,471
What do you want for dinner?

366
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,571
Western or Japanese?

367
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:20,171
Depends on what I drink.

368
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:24,071
After beer, will I have wine, cold sake or shochu?

369
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,071
Or will I have whiskey?

370
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,271
They're all liquor. They're all the same.

371
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:35,071
Listen, kid, wine and sake have their own uniqueness and flavor.

372
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:39,171
And shochu has its own unique...

373
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:41,572
I'm too young to know what you're talking about.

374
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,971
"Next Episode"

375
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:51,371
Yeah. They're both probably dead.

376
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:53,771
It's my fault.

377
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:57,571
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

378
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:01,871
If he was strapped for cash, he couldn't have bought that.

379
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:07,172
I thought I'd give you an accurate version of the events.

380
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:12,972
