1
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:04,130
So, a case, don't you have a case?

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:05,131
Don't you have something?

3
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:08,630
A bloodcurdling kind of interesting case!

4
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,531
Well...

5
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:14,930
There is, sort of...

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,430
But I don't have anything on it yet,

7
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,830
about Rum, a member of the Black Organization,

8
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,230
and I really don't want to get Hattori involved in it.

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,731
Hey!

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:26,930
Are you listening to me, Kudo?

11
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,130
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,930
After you confessed your feelings to that girl at the detective agency,

13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,131
are you sure you haven't lost your edge?

14
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:37,930
Your instinct for sniffing out cases.

15
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,830
Or your antenna for such things, you know.

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,430
What about you? Don't you have anything?

17
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:46,830
If I had anything, I wouldn't be calling you!

18
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,031
No, I know you've got something.

19
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,930
And you're going to bring that over to me.

20
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,430
What're you talking about?

21
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,630
Hey, what's with you?

22
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:02,131
How dare you... just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

23
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,630
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

24
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,830
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

25
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:11,430
In front of our eyes, that is, Hattori and I.

26
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,630
There is a series of people being slashed.

27
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,130
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,030
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,331
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:05,188
"Kamaitachi Inn (Part 1)"

31
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:08,187
True!

32
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,687
This kudzu drink really has a lot of ginger in it and tastes good.

33
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:13,187
It really warms the body up!

34
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:14,188
Just like I told you, right?

35
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,487
I saw in a magazine that

36
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,387
the kudzu drink they serve at this inn is super delicious!

37
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,387
And? What is it?

38
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:23,287
It's a kudzu drink.

39
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,387
I hear it's good for hangovers too!

40
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:28,387
I mean you know,

41
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,287
you didn't call me, the great detective all the way out here

42
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,987
to the boondocks of the mountains in Nagano

43
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:36,087
just to make me drink this gooey stuff, did you?

44
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,288
Of course, not.

45
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,587
You've got a case, right?

46
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:43,787
Yeah.

47
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,987
First of all. Take a look at this picture!

48
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,687
What's this?

49
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,187
Human. No, an animal?

50
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,187
It looks kind of eerie.

51
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,787
Take a good look!

52
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:57,587
At the stuff, it's carrying on its back!

53
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,187
It's a sickle, sickle! An animal that has sickles.

54
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,387
A demon that appears riding on whirlwinds

55
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:06,187
and slashes people

56
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,587
is nothing other than a Kamaitachi, right?

57
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:09,687
Ka...

58
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,387
Kamaitachi?

59
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:16,687
But, I thought that the claws of Kamaitachis were sickles?

60
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:19,987
Isn't this a person carrying a sickle?

61
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,687
Look at its feet.

62
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,087
There's water splashing, right?

63
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:29,187
In the background the outdoor bath of this inn is in view,

64
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,987
but the picture that the writer took from the same angle

65
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,987
and put in the magazine is this!

66
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,187
Compare them. No matter how you look at it,

67
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:40,087
he looks to be running on water, right?

68
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,088
True.

69
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:48,787
He could've lined out several transparent boards in the tub.

70
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:54,087
The water here is clouded like that of Shirahone Hot Spring,

71
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,587
which makes all kinds of tricks possible.

72
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,787
That picture wasn't tampered with.

73
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:01,887
That picture was taken with an analog film

74
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,787
that's difficult to tamper with.

75
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,787
And, we had a specialist look at it too,

76
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,987
so there's no mistake about it!

77
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:11,287
Are you the writer of this picture?

78
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:14,187
Yes! I'm a writer for the monthly magazine IZUNA,

79
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,987
Daigo Nakama!

80
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:20,387
I'm here today to take a picture of the Kamaitachi myself.

81
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:21,487
Oh.

82
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,987
It's gotten very cold.

83
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,687
Is there any connection between Kamaitachi and how cold it is?

84
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:30,187
Well, there are many Kamaitachi legends

85
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,188
in snowy regions, you see.

86
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,887
Therefore, if it should snow tonight,

87
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:39,787
it may just appear riding the snow and wind.

88
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:41,588
I'm going home!

89
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,687
Don't worry.

90
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:44,987
Even if such a thing were to appear,

91
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:49,187
we can beat it up with my Akido and your Karate, Ran!

92
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:52,587
It has a knife and flies through the sky, you know?

93
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:54,087
We'll be beaten!

94
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,487
Don't worry!

95
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,987
Kamaitachis are fake to begin with.

96
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:02,387
I'm sure he just came here without a choice

97
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:04,187
because he got a lot of complaints saying,

98
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,087
"Quit putting on fake pictures", correct?

99
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:08,987
Besides, that photo

100
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:13,687
was mixed in with a bunch of voyeuristic photos of the outdoor bath

101
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:17,687
printed in another one of your publisher's magazines.

102
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:20,187
It's so phony, what a laugh!

103
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,787
Then, what brings you here?

104
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:25,987
Well, I work for a rival magazine company,

105
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:29,587
so I thought I'd come and report on your phony, stupid interview.

106
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,287
Of course, I won't let you put on a scenario

107
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,587
to make this non-existent Kamaitachis seem like it exists.

108
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:36,688
They do exist.

109
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,787
I saw a Kamaitachi!

110
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,487
I saw it running on the water of the hot spring.

111
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,787
Is that true?

112
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:46,787
Yes! I went after it

113
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:49,187
but I can't run on water so...

114
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:52,187
But, more than that it seemed like I was put under a magic spell

115
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,887
or something and couldn't move, so I drowned.

116
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:58,587
When I woke up, I was drenched and sleeping in the corridor.

117
00:06:58,588 --> 00:06:59,788
Oh.

118
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,987
My, Kohei!

119
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,287
What are you doing?

120
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,987
Oh, Mom!

121
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,587
Did you finish decorating your room already?

122
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:09,587
You're inviting your friends over tomorrow

123
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,587
and holding a birthday party, right?

124
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:13,787
I was just going to start from now.

125
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,287
Then, hurry up and get with it.

126
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:17,588
Okay!

127
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,687
Wow! What terribly chapped skin.

128
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,287
Are you all right, Takami?

129
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,387
Yes. Last year, after my husband passed away of an illness,

130
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,687
I've had so many things to do, you see.

131
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,387
What? You know...

132
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,187
Each other?

133
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:34,087
Yeah! We were classmates in Jr. high school.

134
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:37,287
I'm sorry, I posted a strange picture on the magazine.

135
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,887
I hope it's not causing you trouble.

136
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:42,487
Nope, in fact we've been getting more guests thanks to it.

137
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,487
Well, because of the Kamaitachi,

138
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:47,887
the number of people using the outdoor bath decreased though.

139
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,787
What's this about Kamaitachi?

140
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,087
It's extremely unpleasant!

141
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:54,387
Grand Master.

142
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:56,687
Even if we've been getting an increased number of guests

143
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:59,487
thanks to this weird phenomenon, it's only temporary.

144
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:02,888
It'll do nothing for us being in the red!

145
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:08,287
I guess the only way to increase guests would be to use that.

146
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,287
Don't you think so too?

147
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,788
I already refused the other day, didn't I?

148
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,587
Well, once the demon fuss subsides

149
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,587
and you go through tough management again,

150
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,687
I guess you'll change your mind.

151
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:26,287
If someone were to be killed by that thing called Kamaitachi,

152
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,488
it would be a different story, though.

153
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,788
Nyo... Nyotaimori?

154
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,287
Is he telling you to do that stuff where you place sashimi

155
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,987
on the body of a woman and entertain the guests?

156
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,787
Yes, he says that the guests would double.

157
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,287
I've never seen something like that

158
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:46,987
except in erotic samurai movies.

159
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:49,887
If the word gets out, you'd get nabbed for public indecency.

160
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:52,287
Well, I think he's just joking though.

161
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,687
When I got married and came here,

162
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:59,387
this inn and my parents' inn merged and was doing well.

163
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:00,887
But since my husband passed away,

164
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,987
the number of regular guests decreased

165
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,487
and it's true that we are in the red.

166
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:09,387
But, Takami, don't ever do Nyotaimori.

167
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,387
Then, why don't you sell something?

168
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:14,087
Like antique vases.

169
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,087
Come to think of it, there's a large sickle in the storeroom

170
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,987
that a famous bladesmith made modeled after

171
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,987
a foreign grass sickle.

172
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:26,187
Maybe it'll bring in a lot of cash?

173
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,087
How large is that sickle?

174
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:31,687
The blade is about 60cm,

175
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:36,187
and the length of the handle part is almost as tall as I am.

176
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:39,887
You mean it's the one that was in the picture?

177
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:42,987
The one the Kamaitachi was carrying?

178
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:45,387
Where is this storeroom?

179
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:47,187
Near the outdoor bath.

180
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,387
Please take us there then!

181
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,788
Okay!

182
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:56,588
See? It's starting to get interesting, no?

183
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,487
Give me that audio data file then.

184
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,788
No, not just yet.

185
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,287
Let's go, Conan!

186
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,987
Heiji! Hurry up!

187
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:08,888
-Oh, yes. -Got it.

188
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:14,888
I think it was someplace around here.

189
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,888
I don't see it.

190
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,487
Boy, this storeroom sure is dusty.

191
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:27,487
Hey, smoking in a place like this, you'll cause a fire.

192
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,388
Don't worry.

193
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,687
Shall we all help you find it then?

194
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:35,487
Yes.

195
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:37,988
I guess we should.

196
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:40,888
Crap!

197
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,287
Huh?

198
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,687
It's snowing!

199
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,688
Wow, really!

200
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,887
But if it snows...

201
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,888
It's supposed to come, right? Kamaitachi.

202
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:58,987
What's with you guys?

203
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,688
I thought you said you'd be waiting outside.

204
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,787
Isn't this it, Takami?

205
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:08,387
Yes, that's it! It's this sickle!

206
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,787
It sure is antique alright.

207
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:12,287
It looks expensive.

208
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:15,988
My late husband used to say it's probably worth 10 million yen.

209
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:18,787
What?

210
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,188
The light bulb cracked?

211
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:22,788
Ouch!

212
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:24,887
Dad?

213
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:25,987
Heiji?

214
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:28,587
I don't know what happened but it got my arm.

215
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,588
I got slashed on the back of my hand.

216
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,687
You're right.

217
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,588
You're both bleeding.

218
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:39,287
It's the voice of that woman writer.

219
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,787
Where?

220
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,687
Hey, are you all right?

221
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:44,788
What happened?

222
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,588
Hey, that wound.

223
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:53,588
It can't be.

224
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,488
Kamaitachi?

225
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,103
Hey, Kazuha!

226
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,003
Did you call the police?

227
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:08,703
Yes. They said they'd be right over!

228
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,803
But, I wonder if they'd believe our story

229
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,503
about a Kamaitachi attacking us.

230
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,103
Believe us or not,

231
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:18,603
three people have already been slashed like this.

232
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,103
Well, I guess it'll be all right because this is Nagano

233
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,003
and the Nagano Prefectural Police will be here!

234
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:27,203
I see! Inspector Kansuke Yamato!

235
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,403
That's right!

236
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:32,103
I'm sure that super smart one-eyed Inspector

237
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:35,603
will solve this Kamaitachi case in no time at all!

238
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,003
Right!

239
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,803
One-eyed.

240
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:41,403
Come to think of it, Haibara was saying that.

241
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,803
The number two of the Black Organization,

242
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,003
Rum's characteristic was...

243
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:51,303
While I was at the Organization, I heard various descriptions of Rum.

244
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,503
A large brawny man,

245
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,803
an effeminate man,

246
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,604
an old man.

247
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,103
He injured his eye in some accident,

248
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:05,203
and either his left or right eye is an artificial eye.

249
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:09,103
Inspector Yamato one-eyed and a big guy.

250
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:12,603
If he lets his hair down loose, he's long-haired.

251
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,603
And since he uses a cane, from a distance,

252
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:17,603
he could look to be an old man.

253
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:20,604
Hey. Don't tell me Inspector Yamato is...

254
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:26,704
The police are here.

255
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,603
I'm Inspector Yamamura from the Gunma Prefectural Police!

256
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,903
I have just arrived here, you see.

257
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:40,203
This is the Nagano Prefecture, isn't it?

258
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:43,303
This place is just on the border of Gunma, you see!

259
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,803
So, this is our jurisdiction!

260
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:49,803
So, Inspector Yamato's not going to come?

261
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,703
I thought we be able to meet Yui too.

262
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:54,203
Hey.

263
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:57,203
What's with that disappointed attitude of yours?

264
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,203
The flaming dog case,

265
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,104
the river-child case

266
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:04,103
and even the vampire case,

267
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:08,703
I helped solve all these cases from behind the scene. You know?

268
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,803
If the perp is a Kamaitachi...

269
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:15,304
It's show time for demon-hunter Yamamura, isn't it?

270
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,403
Well, but in this scientific day and age

271
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:22,103
when people are talking about going outer space on orbit elevators,

272
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:25,303
Kamaitachis could never be in existence!

273
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:28,303
That remark sounds familiar.

274
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:30,503
Then, please take me to the storeroom

275
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:34,703
that you say the Kamaitachi attacked you, will you?

276
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:38,103
I'm sure it's some kind of mistake, though.

277
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:41,003
He pisses me off! This guy.

278
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,403
I see.

279
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:46,103
You came to this storeroom to look for the antique sickle.

280
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,503
Then this light bulb suddenly cracked,

281
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,603
and someone in the dark

282
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,903
slashed the back of Mr. Mouri's right hand,

283
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:56,203
as well as the left arm of you, who speaks in the Osaka dialect.

284
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:59,203
And lastly, writer Ms. Midori Koyanagi,

285
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:02,703
you were slashed on your left cheek?

286
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,704
Yes.

287
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:07,803
Was there anyone back then that was holding some kind of blade?

288
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:12,503
I was the one holding the sickle back then.

289
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:16,303
The light bulb cracked just when we found it and I was holding it.

290
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:20,103
Then, aren't you the one who did it, didn't you?

291
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:23,303
Didn't you spin that sickle around in the dark?

292
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,903
Idiot! If he flung something like that around,

293
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,103
we wouldn't have gotten away with a wound like this, right?

294
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:33,503
Then, why don't you check if there was blood on the sickle?

295
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,903
We'll of course check on that.

296
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:38,503
But maybe there was somebody

297
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,703
who was near the light bulb that could've cracked it?

298
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,704
There could've been, but we weren't watching.

299
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:49,503
There was nobody near.

300
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:52,603
Back then, we were by the doorway of the entrance but...

301
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:55,203
Everybody was looking in on the sickle until

302
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,404
just before the sound of the light bulb cracking was heard.

303
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:02,003
Is this the only light bulb here?

304
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,103
No.

305
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,703
There's another one near the entrance,

306
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:08,903
but when we got to the storeroom today, it wouldn't turn on.

307
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:13,403
Come to think of it, this storeroom wasn't locked, was it?

308
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:17,503
Oh, no. The door itself is old and worn out,

309
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:21,103
and only old rice grains that were to be disposed of

310
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,403
were stored in here so...

311
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:26,703
But, you mentioned that the sickle may be worth 10 million yen.

312
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:30,003
My late husband only happened to say so,

313
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:34,103
whereas, the Grand Master said it's just a piece of junk.

314
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:37,503
Just a few days ago, a burglar broke into the storeroom again,

315
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:41,203
so I was thinking of getting a new door and locking it,

316
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,603
but Grand Master said there's no need for that

317
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,203
because we're in the red.

318
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:49,403
What did the burglar steal?

319
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:53,203
It wasn't important enough to even be bothered with.

320
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,903
Ah!

321
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:57,003
So, this is the sickle in question!

322
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,803
This indeed looks like a sickle

323
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:00,503
that would be favored and used by an ancient demon,

324
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,803
but all is fine!

325
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:05,503
I, the demon-hunter Yamamura will arrest it "immedemonly",

326
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,503
so rest assured!

327
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,404
A pun...

328
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:13,603
What? A Kamaitachi appeared?

329
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:16,503
How lucky! I wanted to see it too.

330
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,803
Don't say that.

331
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,403
Because some people have gotten hurt, you see.

332
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,203
But, when I almost drowned in the bath,

333
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:27,503
the one who saved me was probably Kamaitachi.

334
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,703
I wanted to thank it!

335
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:33,103
By the way, did you finish decorating your room?

336
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,503
Nope, not yet.

337
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,703
I can't do it alone, like Daddy used to do it.

338
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,803
But, I've got a lot of things to do and I can't help you.

339
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,603
Then, would you like us to help you?

340
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:48,003
Decorating is my cup of tea!

341
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,403
Really?

342
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:51,003
Thank you.

343
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,203
No problem at all.

344
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,604
-Come on, let's go! -Yes!

345
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:58,103
How old are you going to be when your birthday comes?

346
00:17:58,104 --> 00:17:59,104
8 years old!

347
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:01,103
Oh, 8 years old!

348
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:03,203
Come to think of it, you seem to have been

349
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:06,203
celebrating your son's birthday quite grandly every year.

350
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:09,103
I saw it on the website of the inn with photos and all,

351
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:12,303
Yes, because my husband used to love events.

352
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:15,003
During a party for my husband's survival game friends,

353
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,403
they got water everywhere

354
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,703
while shooting each other with water guns.

355
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,603
It was really something.

356
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:24,303
Hey, Kudo, what do you think about this case?

357
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,603
Well, I'm sure that somebody did it in the dark but...

358
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:31,003
After that everybody's belongings were checked

359
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,103
and yet nobody had anything close to a blade, so...

360
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,303
The weapon was probably...

361
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:38,503
The debris of cracked glass of the light bulb!

362
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,803
I still can't figure out how the light bulb was cracked,

363
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,603
but there's no doubt that the perp flung around

364
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:46,603
the cracked pieces of glass of another light bulb

365
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,303
that he had on him to begin with, right?

366
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,303
Yeah. After slashing his targets,

367
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:52,603
if the cracked pieces were thrown on the floor,

368
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,403
they could make it look like one of the pieces

369
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,304
that was broken off then.

370
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:01,503
After examining the sickle for blood,

371
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,203
the results determined...

372
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,503
what shall I say...

373
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:07,804
Nothing was detected!

374
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:10,703
I guess so.

375
00:19:10,704 --> 00:19:13,103
And? Did you also check the pieces of cracked glass

376
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,203
that were scattered on the floor?

377
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:18,303
Yeah, there was nothing strange about them, though.

378
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,903
You found no blood on them?

379
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,703
Are you sure you really checked?

380
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,803
Of course!

381
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,503
We picked up all the cracked pieces

382
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:28,903
and put them back together in their originally form,

383
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:32,003
but there was no blood anywhere.

384
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,303
It can't be.

385
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,103
Then, how?

386
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:37,203
If there was anything strange...

387
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:41,803
We found a cigarette butt and chewed gum on the floor.

388
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:44,903
I think that what happened here is,

389
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:47,703
an old light bulb cracked on its own

390
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:50,603
and happened to slash you accidentally when it shattered.

391
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:54,403
Then we should've felt pain the instant it broke.

392
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:57,504
But there was a delay between them.

393
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,203
It's... it's the girls' voices!

394
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,003
There was a sound before the scream, wasn't there?

395
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,903
The sound of something cracking and bursting!

396
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:10,804
Are you all right?

397
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,003
What's wrong?

398
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,903
The lamp suddenly cracked.

399
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:17,603
Then, the balloons we decorated

400
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:19,303
started bursting one after the other!

401
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,303
The... there's something...

402
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,904
At this inn after all!

403
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,703
Wasn't that voice the Grand Master's voice?

404
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,503
I think it was.

405
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:32,003
Don't tell me the Kamaitachi got him?

406
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:34,103
Where is the Grand Master?

407
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:37,104
I think at this time, he's at the annex.

408
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,203
Hey! Isn't there a short cut?

409
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:45,704
It would be fastest to go through the outdoor bath if possible.

410
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:51,303
No good! Water's still in the tub!

411
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:54,303
It's not time to clean yet, so...

412
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:57,203
Is that place on the other side of the fence

413
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:59,103
where the Grand Master is?

414
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,903
-Yes. -But that fence...

415
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,503
isn't it sort of slightly open?

416
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,603
Kamaitachi!

417
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:10,703
Just like it rides the wind, it ran over the water!

418
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,904
That's impossible!

419
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,803
There doesn't seem to be

420
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:18,903
things like transparent plates in the water either.

421
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,603
Isn't there any other way?

422
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:24,103
Actually the main building and annex are connected by a corridor,

423
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,503
it just happens to be under renovation right now.

424
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,103
It's the long way

425
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,803
but if we go out once and go from the backdoor...

426
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,804
Let's hurry that way then!

427
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:40,704
That's the annex!

428
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,603
Only our footprints are here, which means...

429
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:49,404
Nobody passed through here.

430
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:52,704
Grand Master!

431
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,503
Are you all right?

432
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:57,703
Please get a light!

433
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:58,604
Yes!

434
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,304
It won't turn on.

435
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,403
What's with this paper door?

436
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,103
It's torn...

437
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,003
it looks to have been slashed by something.

438
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,004
Hey! Don't tell me!

439
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:45,903
Then why is there blood on the upper part of the cut?

440
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:49,704
To make it look like Kamaitachi did it.

441
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,403
The suspect is Kamaitachi.

442
00:23:53,404 --> 00:23:54,703
Don't be silly!

443
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,303
What makes you think that a demon or whatever

444
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,203
will go cracking the glass to by lock

445
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,604
or shut the breaker down?

446
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:03,703
I see, so that's the story!

447
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,704
That's why back then, that person...

448
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,603
Next Conan,

449
