1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,020
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,820
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,320
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,420
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,020
"Gin, Shuichi Akai" -Behind the suffocating sink or swim ploys,

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,920
"Vermouth" -lies hidden yet another plan.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
Rena Mizunashi agrees to go back to the Organization

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,420
after getting the FBI to agree to apply the Witness Protection Program

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,620
to her younger brother, Eisuke.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,120
Several days later, we encounter the homicide case

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,720
of a president of a foreign talent production office

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,720
at the hotel we go to eat a buffet lunch.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,820
But, to our surprise, one of the suspects of this murder

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,320
turns out to be FBI agent, Camel.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,720
"James Black, Jodie Starling" -Okay Conan, I'll be right over.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,520
Oh, Jodie.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,120
Huh?

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Be careful.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,920
Something just doesn't feel right today.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,420
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,920
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,820
Rena Mizunashi who sneaks back into the Organization

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,720
is ordered to get rid of Akai.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,220
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,074
"Red and Black Crash: Innocent."

28
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:02,206
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production."

29
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,206
What the... FBI?

30
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,406
Are you serious?

31
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:11,706
This man who has the looks of villain is an agent, you say?

32
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:15,306
"Camel Andre, age 27" -Yes, there's no need to go through a face check.

33
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:18,106
"Camel Andre, age 27" -in order to become a FBI agent, you see.

34
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,506
But, what brings him to Japan?

35
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,606
You know that I'm here in Japan

36
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:25,406
because of a mistake I made as an agent of the FBI,

37
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,406
and is quite depressed, don't you?

38
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,606
Yes.

39
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:30,206
That's why he came to check on me,

40
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,606
because I didn't return for quite some time.

41
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:38,606
Andre Camel here is actually my boyfriend, you see.

42
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,706
What...

43
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:43,306
Right, darling?

44
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,306
Right? Darling.

45
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,306
Oh, yes...

46
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,106
Not bad.

47
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:55,806
And why are you still here in Japan?

48
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,906
Huh?

49
00:03:56,906 --> 00:04:00,606
And, I think your Japanese has gotten better.

50
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,906
Just some time ago you spoke with American accent.

51
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:09,406
So Andre who's good in Japanese gave me special lessons

52
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,006
and I improved really fast.

53
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:14,706
Now, we're both hesitant to leave Japan.

54
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:16,506
Right, darling?

55
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,106
Yes, absolutely right.

56
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,606
They somehow look quite awkward.

57
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,606
Well, even if he's with the FBI,

58
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,806
the fact that he's a suspect doesn't change.

59
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:29,706
You'll have to stay here until all doubts are cleared.

60
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,006
Is that understood?

61
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,906
Yes, of course!

62
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:38,206
Thank you, Conan, for letting me know.

63
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,806
Hey, Jodie.

64
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,306
Before the FBI agents all leave the hospital,

65
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,906
I'd like to go see them one more time.

66
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,306
Okay. Later.

67
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,406
Inspector!

68
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,806
This paper bag was found inside the equipment closet

69
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,806
of the restroom of the top floor restaurant arcade.

70
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:52,906
What?

71
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:58,106
The contents include a raincoat, gloves and a gun.

72
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:00,506
All things that may have been used to commit the murder.

73
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:04,306
I see, that means even if we check the clothing of the three suspects,

74
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,206
there'll be no gun powder reaction.

75
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,806
Yes, and if the killer disposed of the clothes used during the murder,

76
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:12,606
he could even get on a crowded elevator if he really wanted to.

77
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:15,906
Nope, no way.

78
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,806
After committing the murder,

79
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:22,206
the killer used the stairs to go up to the top floor,

80
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,706
then, put the gloves, clothes and gun into the paper bag

81
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:27,506
and hid the paper bag into the equipment closet, right?

82
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:31,106
If so, it would've taken him at least five minutes

83
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,506
to get everything done.

84
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,806
Rushing to do something like that would make him look suspicious.

85
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,606
And I think the killer didn't expect the officers

86
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,606
to arrive here so soon.

87
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,106
True.

88
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:46,706
Oh, and I checked the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator,

89
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,306
but, there were no foreigners riding the elevator.

90
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,606
What about foreigners of Asian descent?

91
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,306
You can't tell just by outward appearance, can you?

92
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,606
Oh, no, I didn't check that closely.

93
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,206
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -I don't think the president.

94
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,606
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -would hire any Asian people.

95
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,806
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Because he always used to say,

96
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,206
it's only interesting

97
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:06,306
when somebody who doesn't look like they can speak Japanese speak it.

98
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:08,806
So, the suspicious ones...

99
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:12,606
are those two and him, don't you think?

100
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,706
Then, the most suspicious would be the one

101
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:16,906
who was hiding in the restroom,

102
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,606
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -you, Hal.

103
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:23,406
I... I just told you that I wasn't hiding.

104
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:25,206
Besides...

105
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,606
if I hid something like that in the restroom,

106
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:30,406
I wouldn't stick around so long in there.

107
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,706
That's true too.

108
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:34,006
But maybe you saw all the officers

109
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:36,106
and decided to go back and hide.

110
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,706
That's possible too, isn't it?

111
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:39,006
Oh, by the way,

112
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,006
the coat was a men's coat for someone of slim physique

113
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:45,106
and the length would be just right for Toby over there.

114
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,406
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Hey...

115
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,806
if it's that size,

116
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,006
I'm sure that guy who says he's a FBI agent can wear it too

117
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,306
if he forces it on, right?

118
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:55,806
Moreover, it's not like it has to be limited to us, men.

119
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,706
Even the secretary over there can wear it.

120
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,406
What?

121
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:03,506
Like they say, the greater embraces the less.

122
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,506
It's true that if all her testimony up to now were all lies

123
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,106
to cover up her own crime.

124
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,406
Yes, it's probable.

125
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,606
In order to make it look like a crime committed by a man,

126
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:17,006
she could've deliberately worn a man's coat.

127
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,306
Oh no! I would never do that!

128
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,006
At any rate, it's pretty obvious

129
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:27,906
that one of you four here fired repeated shots at the president.

130
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,506
Maybe the president was actually eating something.

131
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,806
Huh?

132
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,606
Because look at the president's right hand.

133
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,806
Doesn't it look like he was picking something up?

134
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,606
Now that you mentioned it, yeah.

135
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,906
But there's no food on the desk.

136
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:51,706
Maybe he wasn't eating but holding something.

137
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,406
Right. For example...

138
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,506
A pen or something that was on the desk.

139
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:01,406
Although very slight, there were blood stains

140
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,506
detected on the tip of the pen and the memo pad.

141
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,306
And on the memo pad, there were very light traces

142
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,906
of something having been written.

143
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,006
Don't tell me that...

144
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:11,106
the president wrote something just before he died.

145
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,706
And the killer...

146
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:17,806
If so, please get on with the blood test,

147
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:19,506
and figure out what was written on the memo pad.

148
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,106
Oh, yes.

149
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:22,206
Of course, at the same time,

150
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:23,806
analyze whether it was the president's handwriting.

151
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:25,606
Yes, okay.

152
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:29,206
I mean, if it were us, we would check for sure.

153
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:30,406
Right, darling?

154
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:39,406
So, the blood that was found on the memo pad

155
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,306
was Mr. Sunouchi's blood after all.

156
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:45,406
Yes, the handwriting was confirmed to be his writing too.

157
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:47,506
And, what was written on the memo?

158
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:52,006
Well... it was written in English.

159
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,306
As to the meaning of what was written,

160
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,106
it couldn't have been a dying message.

161
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,906
Bring my tux.

162
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,306
Bring...

163
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,806
Bring my tux.

164
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,206
Please bring...

165
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,306
my tuxedo?

166
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,406
Yes.

167
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:24,506
Continuing this job is too nerve racking.

168
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,706
Yes, it's too painful,

169
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:29,106
and I can't go on, so I'd like out.

170
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:32,706
Yes, I'm very sorry.

171
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,306
Goodbye.

172
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,906
Gin.

173
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,806
Kir.

174
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,606
Who were you talking to?

175
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,306
On the other end of the line.

176
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:56,806
Come on.

177
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,106
To the personnel at the TV station.

178
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,606
I told them straight

179
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,606
that I can't go on as an announcer anymore,

180
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,306
so that I'd like to quit.

181
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:08,406
I didn't want them coming to look for me either.

182
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:11,906
Besides I know that the Organization knows what I was talking about

183
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,206
because everything leaks out.

184
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:17,806
I've got a lot of wiretaps and communicators attached to me

185
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:21,806
with two or three people constantly monitoring me.

186
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:28,506
So do you have something you want

187
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,706
with this poor can't roam free girl

188
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:32,806
who is still being suspected by that person.

189
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,406
I've come to relay a message

190
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,106
from that person who highly suspects you.

191
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,006
Kill a person for me

192
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:56,406
and let me believe that you're innocent.

193
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,006
It says?

194
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:00,606
Kill?

195
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,206
Who?

196
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:07,206
FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

197
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:15,006
Shuichi Akai.

198
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:26,844
FBI agent, Akai.

199
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:31,844
I am too, but that person has his doubts too.

200
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:35,844
That we so easily got you back from the hands of the FBI.

201
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,544
I am to relay to you that if you want to prove your innocence,

202
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:46,044
send the trump of the FBI, Shuichi Akai to the world beyond

203
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:48,744
with your own hands.

204
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:50,644
What's up, Kir?

205
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,144
Don't tell me that you can't do it for some reason?

206
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,444
There's no reason or anything.

207
00:11:57,444 --> 00:12:01,244
Gin, even you're having it tough with Akai,

208
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,244
just how do you propose I do it?

209
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:06,144
If I go out there near the FBI,

210
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:07,844
I'll get caught again, you know.

211
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,344
You're not going near them.

212
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:14,444
You're going to lure him into our shooting range.

213
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,144
Give him a sob story like you went back to the Organization,

214
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:20,244
but you're being treated badly

215
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:23,644
because you goofed and got caught by the FBI.

216
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,244
You feel out of place at the Organization so you want out

217
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:29,144
and you want him to help you get away and go abroad.

218
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,544
That'll probably be good enough.

219
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,544
Of course you're asking him to come alone.

220
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,744
He'll come for sure if you tell him

221
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:40,244
that you'll give him info.

222
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:41,344
I see.

223
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,944
And when he comes along,

224
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,244
you're all going to shoot bullets

225
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,044
and make a beehive out of him?

226
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:50,244
No, you're sending him off alone.

227
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,844
Huh?

228
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:54,944
He has a sharp nose that is second to none.

229
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:57,844
If he senses our presence,

230
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,944
he'll figure that it's a trap and turn right around.

231
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:03,644
We're going to be watching everything

232
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,444
from a place where his bullets can't reach us.

233
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,744
With the wiretap and camera

234
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,744
that will be set onto you.

235
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,244
Okay.

236
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:14,644
I'll do as you say,

237
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,244
so give me a little time, okay?

238
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:17,444
No.

239
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:20,444
Now, call him out here right now.

240
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,844
If you can't do it,

241
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:27,244
all I'll do is call Death to come get you.

242
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:31,344
Wait, I hope you don't think that

243
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:35,144
the FBI really talked me into siding with them?

244
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,744
A little of that too,

245
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,944
but according to info that we got from one of our men,

246
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,544
those guys are still at the hospital you were at.

247
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,144
And for some reason,

248
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,944
one of the agents got messed up in an incident,

249
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:48,844
and the eyes of the FBI are turned in that direction.

250
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:52,044
We couldn't possibly let this chance slip right by us.

251
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,144
What incident?

252
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:57,844
Yeah, a president of a company

253
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:00,044
somewhere got his body ventilated with air holes.

254
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,044
Just an ordinary murder case.

255
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:10,944
Bring my tuxedo to me, please?

256
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,644
You mean that's what was written

257
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,644
on the memo that president wrote?

258
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,144
Yes.

259
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,944
Bring my tux.

260
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:22,944
Bring tux is short for tuxedo.

261
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,344
How baffling.

262
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,644
There are blood stains on the pen and memo paper.

263
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,444
The handwriting is the president's.

264
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,344
Moreover, the memo itself is torn off.

265
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,644
Which means...

266
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:36,644
The president who was shot wrote this down

267
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,344
just before he died.

268
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,944
The killer who notice it,

269
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,244
tore it off and took it away with him.

270
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:47,144
I can see it to be none other than a dying message though.

271
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,544
No...

272
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,244
Dying message...

273
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:54,944
Oh right, you're both English teachers, aren't you?

274
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:59,244
It's true that I'm teaching English at a prep school,

275
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:02,544
but aren't these people FBI agents?

276
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,944
Oh, right, I had my reasons,

277
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:08,244
and was working as a teacher for a little while.

278
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,044
Right, darling?

279
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,644
Yes, that's right.

280
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,944
By the way, Irina,

281
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,444
do you have any idea

282
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,944
as to what this bring me my tuxedo please means?

283
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,044
Oh, yes.

284
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:26,144
I'm pretty sure that the president addressed that message to me.

285
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:27,944
There's going to be a party tonight,

286
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:31,844
so I think he wanted me to get his tuxedo ready for him by then.

287
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:32,844
What?

288
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,944
Then, you're saying that this was just a plain message,

289
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,544
not connected with the incident at all?

290
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:39,544
Yes.

291
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,344
Because the president said that he was going to have a meal together

292
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:45,044
with a new talent this afternoon.

293
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,044
He left the message so that I would know about it

294
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,444
when I returned from outside.

295
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:51,644
Which means that you're the one who tore this memo off

296
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:52,744
and took it with you?

297
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,544
No!

298
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:58,244
I found the president dead, so I called 110.

299
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,944
I didn't touch anything until the police got here!

300
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,744
But, I knew about the tuxedo,

301
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,044
so I left a message in the voice mail.

302
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,844
Voice mail?

303
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,944
So, this is it?

304
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,644
This is Palmer.

305
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:17,244
President, have you gone out already?

306
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,744
I found the file that you asked me to look for,

307
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,344
so I'll take it over to you.

308
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,744
Oh, and as to the tuxedo you're wearing to tonight's party,

309
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:24,844
I'll get to it later.

310
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:29,744
It is 1.27pm, Friday.

311
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:30,944
True.

312
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:35,744
Maybe the killer heard this and rushed out of here.

313
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,644
Or, in order to make it look that way,

314
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,044
maybe she switched the phone to voice mail deliberately

315
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,444
after committing the murder.

316
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,744
What? Oh, no!

317
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:45,444
It's a possibility.

318
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:49,444
If there's a hidden meaning to bring my tux...

319
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,744
In order to deceive us,

320
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,344
maybe you deliberately recorded your message mentioning the tuxedo.

321
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,844
Oh, how cruel.

322
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:57,844
But...

323
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:01,044
When you say tuxedo, it seems connected with...

324
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:04,644
that man who is working as a model, right?

325
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:07,844
Huh? Hey, wait up.

326
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,944
It's true that the job of a model

327
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:12,644
is to wear all kinds of clothes in a cool way.

328
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,444
But we don't just wear tuxedos, you know.

329
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,844
The president was trying to wear it too.

330
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,844
Well... we'll do the investigating,

331
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,444
so please wait in a different room, everyone.

332
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,244
Shinichi, did you figure out something from that memo?

333
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:36,744
Maybe he added something on to the memo that was already there

334
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,744
and turned it into a dying message?

335
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:41,144
If so, the forensic officers would've noticed

336
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,144
the words that were added on.

337
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,944
Adding or subtracting something to this English statement

338
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,044
doesn't look as if it would indicate something

339
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,844
other than it already looks to be.

340
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:55,444
I wonder if it's appropriate to ask at a time like this,

341
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:58,544
but what happened two years ago?

342
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,144
You mentioned just the other day too,

343
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,744
that you came to Japan two years ago.

344
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,844
Two years ago is when Shuichi was still at the Organization

345
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,944
doing undercover investigation, right?

346
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:14,244
Then, I'm sure you've heard about the agent who goofed,

347
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:16,544
and that resulted failure to capture an executive member of theirs.

348
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:20,844
The agent who goofed back then was me.

349
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,144
Yes, it was two years ago.

350
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,944
We staked out at the warehouse

351
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,844
where Mr. Akai had made an appointment.

352
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:36,844
An elderly man appeared and sat down on the spot.

353
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:39,244
Mr. Akai ignored the man,

354
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,844
but I carelessly called out to him

355
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:46,644
and said it's dangerous here so leave.

356
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,044
I see,

357
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,844
so that old man was also a member of the Organization

358
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:52,944
that was supposed to be there?

359
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:53,944
Yes.

360
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,444
On top of that the executive never showed up

361
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,344
and the fact that Mr. Akai was a FBI agent was also disclosed.

362
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,844
Oh, I remember.

363
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,644
There was a person with his head drooping low

364
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,144
among the members who came back to headquarters

365
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,344
after sneaking into the Organization failed.

366
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,744
That's why when Mr. Akai requested someone cut out

367
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:17,244
for the next strategy...

368
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:20,744
I can handle the driving job!

369
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,944
I'll come to Japan right away!

370
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,744
I was told that I maybe killed.

371
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:31,944
But, my mistake was what caused the death of Mr. Akai's girlfriend.

372
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:37,044
Mr. Akai told me not to worry about it,

373
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:39,444
because his girlfriend was also ready for what was to come.

374
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,544
A FBI agent?

375
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:48,944
You, Dai?

376
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:52,344
Yeah. I'll be leaving to settle things tomorrow.

377
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,044
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,144
If you're trying to fool me,

379
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:00,344
can't you think of a better lie?

380
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:06,844
That's not surprising at all!

381
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:11,344
You knew, didn't you?

382
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,644
If you knew, why didn't you stay away from me?

383
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,944
I was using you, you know!

384
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:19,944
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

385
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:28,044
Akai...

386
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,244
Your phone's been ringing for sometime now.

387
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,744
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:38,644
-Yes. -It's me.

389
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:42,844
It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

390
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,444
Is it okay now? Is there anyone around you?

391
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,544
What...

392
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,944
Yeah, I'm alone.

393
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,944
I'll bet you're surprised getting a call from me so soon

394
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:56,244
after returning to the Organization.

395
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,144
Sort of...

396
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:00,344
Explain what you mean.

397
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,244
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

398
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:07,544
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

399
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:11,044
Of course I'll give you the information that the FBI wants.

400
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:14,044
Would it be possible to see you now?

401
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,844
Yeah, if you're alone too,

402
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:18,144
it's okay with me.

403
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,644
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

404
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:24,044
Yeah.

405
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:25,344
Satisfied?

406
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,144
Today is Friday the 13th.

407
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:31,644
I don't believe in things like that to begin with...

408
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,244
But there couldn't be a better day for him to die.

409
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:43,144
Akai, was that Rena Mizunashi?

410
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:46,944
Yes, she asked me to come meet her now, just the two of us.

411
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:49,644
Just the two of you. It could be a trap.

412
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:52,044
I'd advise you not to go.

413
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,844
Yes, but if it's a trap,

414
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,044
if I don't go,

415
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:59,544
there's a ten to one chance that she'll be killed.

416
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:01,844
That...

417
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,344
I'll be fine.

418
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:07,044
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

419
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:09,144
She herself is an agent of the CIA,

420
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,644
I'm sure she's thought up something to make it through this too.

421
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:14,144
At any rate, let's call Jodie

422
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,044
and think of what we as FBI agents can do.

423
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,944
Akai?

424
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:22,344
What is it?

425
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:55,044
"Next episode" -Message left behind.

426
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,944
The ringtone.

427
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,544
What does it mean?

428
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:01,144
A trap or a scream?

429
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:02,444
Who's taking the risk,

430
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,744
the one who set the trap or the one who takes the dive?

431
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,144
Behind the scene, there lurks,

432
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:12,144
a surprising truth and malicious eyes.

433
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,744
