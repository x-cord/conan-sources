1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:02,005
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,905
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:05,705
A mysterious elderly couple moves into a new house.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,605
A presence and sense of being watched that sprout concern.

5
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:09,405
Am I the target or is it Ai?

6
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,905
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:12,705
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:15,006
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:22,327
To Beikacho, right?

10
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,928
Okay.

11
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:39,202
Hey. Do you know that a new house was built near your house, Conan?

12
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,802
A new house?

13
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:42,502
No.

14
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:43,902
What kind of house is it?

15
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,302
Is it big?

16
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:49,103
No, it's small and very cute!

17
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,902
The house suits your taste, doesn't it, Ayumi?

18
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,102
Yep!

19
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:57,602
I thought that I'd like to live in a house like that after I get married.

20
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:58,603
-What? -What?

21
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,603
-Married? -Married?

22
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,503
Conan, would you like to go see it on our way home?

23
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,102
What?

24
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:13,103
Nothing.

25
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:16,102
Come on, Ayumi. Let's just all of us go!

26
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,602
Just leave that guy alone, okay?

27
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:21,502
What? Why are coming along, too?

28
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,202
The same to you, Mitsuhiko.

29
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,102
Conan! Quick!

30
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,002
Why are you asking Conan to come?

31
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:28,503
Right!

32
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,402
What's the matter?

33
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:34,502
Nothing.

34
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,502
I just felt like someone is watching me.

35
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,103
Maybe it's just my imagination.

36
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:55,203
"The Grenier House on Beikacho."

37
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,202
I see.

38
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,703
So it's this house.

39
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:04,303
Here you go. Mitsuhiko, open your mouth.

40
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:10,703
Genta, you finished eating already?

41
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,302
Hey, hey.

42
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:15,402
What are you all imagining?

43
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,702
It's really a small and cute house.

44
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:18,902
Don't you think so?

45
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:21,502
And Conan, do you like houses like this?

46
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:22,702
What?

47
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:24,702
-Me? -Yes, you.

48
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,902
Ayumi!

49
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:28,202
How come you're asking Conan?

50
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,202
He's out of the picture.

51
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,602
Because he may become my husband in the future.

52
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,503
So I'd like to know what kind of things he likes.

53
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,102
Hey, Ayumi!

54
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,702
Then you've got to see the inside of the house at all costs, too.

55
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:44,703
What?

56
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,202
So, will you show us inside?

57
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,902
You've got to be kidding.

58
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,002
Just because I didn't say anything about your ridiculous conversation.

59
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,102
Her parents are looking for a house right now, you know.

60
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,502
If she likes the house...

61
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,303
They may just buy the house.

62
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,803
Let me show you in!

63
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:13,902
There are two 6-mat western style rooms, a bathroom with a bath tub

64
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:17,702
with a changing room on the 1st floor.

65
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:20,302
Are the two western style rooms for children?

66
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,502
Yes.

67
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:24,302
It seems that the person who built this house had in mind

68
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:28,902
a couple in their 30's with two children, a total family of four.

69
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:32,902
On the 2nd floor is a 16-mat living room and a kitchen.

70
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:33,903
How spacious!

71
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:36,402
It's nice and sunny, too!

72
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,702
There is an 8-mat western style room towards the roadside.

73
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,302
There's a 3rd floor, too.

74
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:45,702
Yes, the selling point of this house is the Grenier.

75
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:48,502
This is interesting!

76
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:50,403
There's a window here, too!

77
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:56,702
You can see the sky!

78
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,303
You can watch the stars at night, too.

79
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,502
Detective agency?

80
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:14,003
It's in view from here.

81
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,802
How did you like it?

82
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:21,202
The Grenier and the 2nd floor living room were nice.

83
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:24,002
Both rooms on the 1st floor were kind of dark.

84
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,302
A larger yard would be better, too.

85
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,702
The stairs were a bit too steep, too.

86
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:33,602
But for a house built on a small lot, I think it's pretty well made.

87
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:37,402
And will you recommend this house to your parents?

88
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:38,503
What?

89
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,202
Well, of course...

90
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,102
Now that we have seen the inside,

91
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,103
let's go.

92
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,102
The layout was not all that great.

93
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,203
My house is a lot more comfy to live in!

94
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,902
What? That house was sold?

95
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,702
Yep, when I passed by yesterday with mother,

96
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,702
the "For Sale" sign was folded,

97
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:08,702
so I asked.

98
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,302
That's too bad,

99
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:13,202
since you seemed to like it, Ayumi.

100
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:16,002
But the inside wasn't all that great.

101
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,502
No need to be disappointed, Ayumi.

102
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,902
I'll build you a better house.

103
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:24,102
Why are you going to build a house for Ayumi, Genta?

104
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,202
I'm the one who's going to build her house!

105
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:31,302
I wonder if the buyer was a couple in their 30's with two children?

106
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,702
Well, I guess so.

107
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,302
Nope.

108
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:37,302
They were an elderly couple way into the 70's.

109
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:40,002
An elderly couple?

110
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:45,002
Strange. That house isn't made for elderly people to live in.

111
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:46,402
You're right.

112
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:49,603
It has three floors and the stairs are steep, too.

113
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:57,103
But everyone has their own reason, so I guess it's okay.

114
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:05,302
Hisashi Udo?

115
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:08,302
What a queer name.

116
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,702
You guys.

117
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:11,902
Since there's a name plate, it means...

118
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:14,002
They've already moved in.

119
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,902
What brings you guys here?

120
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:19,502
We figured you'd be concerned and come look.

121
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:23,802
Even if it's a trivial thing, if in doubt, check it out thoroughly.

122
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,902
That's the basics of a detective!

123
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:27,303
Hey, hey.

124
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:32,202
My, hello!

125
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:33,902
Hello...

126
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:37,102
Do all of you live in this neighbourhood?

127
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:40,702
We just moved in today.

128
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,502
If it's okay with you,

129
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:45,402
please come in and tell me all kind of things about this town.

130
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,302
Yes! Sure!

131
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,102
If it's about Beikacho, you can count on us!

132
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:53,502
I even know which shop sells the best eels over rice and its cheap, too!

133
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,702
Right.

134
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,203
There.

135
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,803
Here goes.

136
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:05,102
I'll be going, then.

137
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,602
Goodbye.

138
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,203
Goodbye...

139
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,502
So you're all detectives?

140
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:19,202
Yes! The Youth Detective Squad of Teitan Elementary...

141
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:21,802
Is known by everyone in Beikacho.

142
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:25,002
We're just as well-known as Kojima Liquor Store.

143
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:26,003
-Here you go. -What?

144
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,703
-Thank you. -Is that so?

145
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,302
I'm sorry. The furniture hasn't arrived yet.

146
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:35,402
Not at all.

147
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,702
Grandma.

148
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:39,602
Are you going to live here with the elderly man who went out a while ago?

149
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,702
That's right.

150
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,302
The stairs seem steep, but aren't you afraid?

151
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,402
Not at all.

152
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:49,602
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

153
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,502
I think I know how you feel.

154
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:57,302
My grandma said she wanted to try living in a tower condo once, too!

155
00:09:57,303 --> 00:10:01,202
Besides, this house is close to the house our only son lives in.

156
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:03,102
I see.

157
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,602
But please do be careful.

158
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,003
Thank you. It's so nice of you.

159
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,402
Thank you for everything.

160
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,802
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

161
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:14,502
Our doubts have been cleared.

162
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:19,302
That couple bought that house because their son lives nearby.

163
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:23,102
She also said she wanted to live in that type of house.

164
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,002
But something bothers me.

165
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,102
What does?

166
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:30,803
Well, I can't really say.

167
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:35,802
What? The day after tomorrow?

168
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,002
Yeah.

169
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,202
What is it?

170
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,402
What is it that's bugging me?

171
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:45,602
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

172
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,103
Here goes.

173
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:49,303
Is it this?

174
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:51,402
Is this what's bothering me?

175
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,802
But any elderly man would do so.

176
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,103
More than that, back then...

177
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,602
Why was she wearing that look on her face?

178
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:01,502
Hey, hey. Conan, are you listening?

179
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,602
Like I was saying,

180
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,702
dad and I have to attend a memorial service tomorrow and will be late,

181
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:08,002
please watch the house.

182
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,302
Gosh, Conan.

183
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,002
I see. Sorry, sorry.

184
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:16,503
Hey, don't ponder when you're eating!

185
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,003
It hurts!

186
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,203
Dad!

187
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,310
Shoots.

188
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,941
A cab? Bummers.

189
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:41,641
Darn it!

190
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:48,692
Shinichi, what are you doing in a place like this?

191
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,792
Doc? All right!

192
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,292
Talk about good timing!

193
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,592
What?

194
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:54,692
Could you...

195
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,892
go after that cab up front?

196
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,192
Doc! Hurry!

197
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,193
Yeah. Okay.

198
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:05,392
Although it bothers you,

199
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:10,092
there's nothing unnatural about the activity of the old man.

200
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:14,892
Old people usually use their hands for support when standing up.

201
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,192
I thought so, too.

202
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:20,592
The old lady probably frowned

203
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:24,492
because she's been telling him time and again to get up smoothly.

204
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,892
She probably doesn't like her husband acting too old.

205
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:31,092
Although Genta always told me that I act like an old fart, too.

206
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,593
Old fart!

207
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,892
I'm sorry to have bothered you on your way shopping.

208
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:42,192
Go on ahead home.

209
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,592
Okay.

210
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:46,892
I understand you want to check things out until you're convinced,

211
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,692
but are you going to be okay alone?

212
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,892
Don't worry.

213
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,292
Shinichi.

214
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:55,593
I wonder what Ai would do at a time like this?

215
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:37,792
Yes!

216
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,493
For things like that...

217
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,093
I'll cooperate anytime if I can be of help.

218
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:50,593
Shoots!

219
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,193
That was so close!

220
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,492
I came home leaving things as is.

221
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,892
Who on earth is that Chinese man?

222
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,092
And who is that old man...

223
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,193
exactly?

224
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:10,992
Isn't that from the direction of the Grenier house?

225
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,993
Don't tell me that...

226
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:25,692
The skylight of the Grenier house.

227
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,392
A camera?

228
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,692
Moreover,

229
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,392
why is it facing towards the detective agency?

230
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,492
Are they taking pictures of Pops?

231
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,092
Or...

232
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,492
What's the matter?

233
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,493
Nothing.

234
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:39,793
I just felt like someone is watching me.

235
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,892
Am I the target?

236
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,892
If so...

237
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,293
Don't tell me they're the guys from Black Organization?

238
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,892
How about it, Haibara?

239
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:04,393
Have you ever seen them in the organization?

240
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:06,593
I see.

241
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:10,592
But they could be in disguise.

242
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:11,792
In disguise?

243
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:12,793
Yes.

244
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,093
Disguise?

245
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,393
Shinichi...

246
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,893
So it's you after all, mom.

247
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:21,992
Long time no see, Yukiko.

248
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,792
Dr. Agasa.

249
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,792
He got us, Yukiko.

250
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:28,792
This time, he got Doc to act on his side.

251
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,593
He paid us back for what we did some time ago.

252
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,892
But how did you find out?

253
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:40,192
Give me an explanation before you ask me questions.

254
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,792
What do you think you're doing, pulling off something like this?

255
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,992
We came back to Japan in the morning the day before yesterday

256
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,593
for Yusaku's next interview job.

257
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,292
To Beikacho, right?

258
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:52,593
Okay.

259
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:56,092
After we stopped over at the house,

260
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,992
I got worried about you

261
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,192
and went alone to check you at the elementary school.

262
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:04,593
You just happened to come out with your friend.

263
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:07,792
Conan! Quick!

264
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:09,592
Why are you asking Conan to come?

265
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:10,992
Right!

266
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:13,792
You're really sharp, Shinichi.

267
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,793
I thought you saw through me.

268
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:23,492
I was relieved to see that you are doing well,

269
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:26,892
but I was thinking that I wanted to see how you were living

270
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:30,292
after becoming Conan before leaving for the States

271
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,093
without letting you know.

272
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,592
You didn't have to start feeling that way.

273
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:39,092
But when I was walking, I was thinking about

274
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:43,492
the way I could watch you without being noticed.

275
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:46,592
I coincidentally found that house.

276
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,292
Though it was small, I liked the house

277
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,492
and I didn't intend to get it at first.

278
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:54,592
From the window of the Grenier,

279
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,192
the detective agency is in view!

280
00:18:57,193 --> 00:19:00,492
That's when she came upon this striking thought.

281
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,792
We'll just rent the house for a week,

282
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:06,592
disguised as an elderly couple and watch your lifestyle secretly

283
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:10,492
from the window of the Grenier.

284
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:14,393
Yusaku thought that my idea was amusing, too.

285
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:20,292
So we went to the realtor to ask if it was okay.

286
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,592
It turns out the president happened to be a great fan of mine.

287
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,193
-Here you go. -Thank you.

288
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,493
He immediately agreed.

289
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:37,392
I was really surprised when all of you came the following day though.

290
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:44,192
Since I'm an actress, I had confidence that I could deceive you,

291
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:46,692
but as for Yusaku...

292
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,892
Yeah. That acting of yours was what got me thinking, dad.

293
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,793
Here goes.

294
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,592
But that's...

295
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:56,593
Yeah.

296
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,092
Like you said Doc,

297
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,292
it's only natural for elderly men

298
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:01,692
to use their hand to support themselves when getting up,

299
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:04,692
but that's only when nobody's watching.

300
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:07,292
In front of people, they try with all their might not to show it.

301
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,392
I feel that's the psyche of elderly people.

302
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:11,792
Yes, even in the world of acting,

303
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:16,192
when people act as elderly people, they are inclined to act that way.

304
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:19,892
That's why you frowned when he did so, right?

305
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,092
You saw?

306
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:24,892
Right. I thought, "Oh no, he did it."

307
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,692
It can't be help, can it?

308
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,392
After all, I'm a suspense novel writer and not an actor.

309
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:33,192
But your acting was pretty good too, dad.

310
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:36,193
You knew that Doc and I were tailing you, right?

311
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,992
Sort of.

312
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:41,092
The Chinese owner of the shop

313
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:43,192
used to be the head of a chivalrous group of robbers

314
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:45,492
that raided the great continent during his younger days.

315
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,892
I went to the shop to interview him about my upcoming "Night Baron" Series.

316
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:54,592
"Night Baron vs. Mysterious Chinese Man"

317
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:56,993
I asked him to scare you a bit.

318
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,092
I was really surprised when he threw the dagger at you.

319
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,393
Yusaku!

320
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:11,092
At any rate, don't you think that's going a bit too far?

321
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,692
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:18,292
But I was really worried about the kind of life you were living,

323
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,692
since we've been living away from you for a while.

324
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,392
If I were to see you in person and ask you,

325
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:25,092
you would naturally say that everything's okay, right?

326
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,792
I wanted to know...

327
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,093
I wanted to know the real genuine fact.

328
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:32,493
Mom.

329
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,292
Besides,

330
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,093
I wanted a lot of pictures of you...

331
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:45,093
as a child again!

332
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,993
You win, mom.

333
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:27,992
That elderly couple already moved, didn't they?

334
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:31,792
The house wasn't suited for elderly people after all.

335
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,392
But their name was sure interesting.

336
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:36,892
What was it?

337
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:38,792
Hisashi Udo.

338
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:42,692
Why didn't I realize something so simple?

339
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:47,093
All I had to do was interchange the characters of Udoku.

340
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:51,793
Oh, well.

341
00:23:58,193 --> 00:24:00,392
"Next Episode"

342
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:02,092
I'm going to check out the famous sightseeing spots

343
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,493
and drink up the "all-you-can-drink"!

344
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:14,992
I wonder if something happened?

345
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:15,993
What?

346
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,592
Don't...

347
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,792
Don't tell me that this is...

348
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:28,193
Next Conan, "The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 1)"

349
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,792
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,292
"Sightseeing spot."

351
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,592
What does the sightseeing spot bring to mind?

352
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,992
-Seeing eye dog! -A seer!

353
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:53,193
-Kyoto. -What a wet blanket.
