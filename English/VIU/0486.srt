1
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:04,052
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:05,752
After the tears are "Welcoming Cats".

3
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:07,652
Welcoming cats also welcome crime?

4
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:09,552
Which paw is raised? Left, right

5
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,652
or both?

6
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:12,152
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,652
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:15,752
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:06,642
Hey! Don't you dare look up.

10
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:08,242
I'll kill you if you do!

11
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:09,542
I know.

12
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,342
Just hurry up, will you?

13
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,442
Why?

14
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:16,142
Why do I have to do something like this when I just happened to walk by?

15
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:21,242
Don't worry, come on over here.

16
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,142
Just a little more and I can reach him.

17
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:26,942
I mean you're really smaller than you should be, Conan.

18
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,742
Pardon me.

19
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,642
Thanks to who.

20
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:37,842
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

21
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:39,842
Nope.

22
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,742
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

23
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,042
Cha-cha!

24
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,642
Where were you, Cha-cha?

25
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,242
Excuse me.

26
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,642
"Tamotsu Ishigami(35)" -It's my cat.

27
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,142
He's been missing from just some time ago,

28
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:01,642
and I've been looking for him.

29
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,342
He was in the park.

30
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,742
He seems to have hurt his right paw

31
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:07,742
and is bleeding a bit.

32
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:10,942
You treated him?

33
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,742
-Thank you. -No problem.

34
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,142
As a token of my appreciation,

35
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:16,642
why don't you have something cold to drink at my shop?

36
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:20,042
Although there's one boisterous customer inside now.

37
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,542
Please come in!

38
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,142
There! There! Go for it!

39
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:26,142
Whip! Whip! Whip him.

40
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:28,042
Go!

41
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,142
My goodness.

42
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,842
"Office Kanemaru."

43
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:37,042
Master!

44
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,742
Ishigami... Bad news! Please come quickly!

45
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,742
"Kanemaru Office."

46
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:47,242
"Cha-cha Coffee Shop."

47
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,542
Mr. Kanemaru!

48
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:12,142
"Welcoming Cat from Right to Left."

49
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,642
Master, coffee please.

50
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,142
May I have a second serving?

51
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,442
Inspector Megure!

52
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,142
Why did inspector...

53
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,942
I wonder what it is?

54
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,442
Inspector.

55
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,442
You again?

56
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:45,042
Well, I saw police cars while I was taking a walk

57
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,242
and I thought that I should show up again so...

58
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,242
And why are you here?

59
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,542
Oh, never mind.

60
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,542
Do we have a case here?

61
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,142
Yep, the president of this company...

62
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:57,542
Kanemaru Office?

63
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:01,442
What do they do here?

64
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,742
Although it sounds like some prestigious company,

65
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:06,342
it's just another money-lending business.

66
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:07,542
He's the president of the company but the fact is,

67
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,142
there are no other employees, and he runs this place alone.

68
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,342
What's the victim's name and what about his family?

69
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:14,842
He's Mr. Kenzo Kanemaru, age 65.

70
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,642
He's single and has no family.

71
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,042
The coroner says that

72
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,742
the cause of death is a deadly blow to his head with a hard object.

73
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:27,642
He was probably hit on the head with one of those welcoming cats there.

74
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:30,342
Talk about a lot of cats.

75
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:33,742
The debris of the cracked cat seems to be scattered around the dead body.

76
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:35,742
The murder weapon is a welcoming cat?

77
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:38,042
And what's the estimated time of death?

78
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,242
Yes, sir, just several hours ago

79
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,742
between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.

80
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:46,342
Who is he?

81
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:48,342
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

82
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,242
"Fumie Imaoka (65)" -And she's Ms. Fumie Imaoka,

83
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,742
the one who found him.

84
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:52,842
She is a contract worker

85
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:55,342
who comes once a week to clean the place.

86
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,042
She came here today as usual,

87
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,142
at around 1:30 p.m.

88
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:07,642
Just who do you think you're making the report to?

89
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,542
I'm sorry, I got carried away...

90
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,942
The safe seems to have been ransacked.

91
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,342
Inspector Megure,

92
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,842
there's approximately 1 million yen in it,

93
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,242
that hasn't been touched.

94
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,242
I see.

95
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:31,042
Inspector! The one who found the dead body, that is, the killer.

96
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,042
Isn't this how the theory goes?

97
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,442
Ms. Imaoka...

98
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,442
has a debt of about 300,000 yen.

99
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,842
He probably severely demanded payment of her

100
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:42,942
and because of the pressure ended up hitting him.

101
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:46,242
A very common pattern indeed, yes.

102
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,642
Hey, Mr. Detective!

103
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,542
You aren't suspecting me, aren't you?

104
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,142
It's true that I borrowed money!

105
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,242
300,000 yen.

106
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:55,742
Moreover, he told me to come clean this place in place of paying him interest.

107
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,742
And it's true that I'm angry.

108
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,042
But, that doesn't mean that!

109
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,742
Calm down. Let's not get so upset.

110
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:03,842
-Inspector! -What is it?

111
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,442
It's something that was on the desk of the president's room next door.

112
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,142
Please take a look at it.

113
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:09,942
It's a daily dated notebook.

114
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:13,842
September 3rd, 12:30p.m., Chika Murai.

115
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,242
In other words, today,

116
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,942
I think it would be safe to say that

117
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:20,542
the victim was scheduled to meet this woman.

118
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,442
About that,

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,242
the Master of the coffee shop on the opposite side of the street

120
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:28,442
says that at about 12:30 p.m.

121
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:30,942
he saw a young woman come into this office.

122
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,442
A young woman?

123
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,142
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

124
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:38,142
-And, what did she look like? -Yes.

125
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:44,742
She had a brand name bag and wore expensive brand clothes, too.

126
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:48,142
"Chika Murai(22)" -She looked to be a flashy type of woman.

127
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:53,242
I think it was about 10 minutes later.

128
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,942
She came here about 12:30 p.m.

129
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,942
and left at about 12:40 p.m.

130
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,642
Right on the bull's eye of the estimated time of death.

131
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:06,642
Yes, so we think she may have information regarding the incident

132
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:09,442
and have dispatched a look out for her throughout this jurisdiction.

133
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,642
Yes, I see. I got it.

134
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:30,142
Bring her over so we can have her identified.

135
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,942
A woman who looks to be Ms. Chika has been taken into custody.

136
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,942
They're headed this way.

137
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,042
Is that right?

138
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,942
The victim Mr. Kanemaru sure has a strange hobby,

139
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,142
collecting so many welcome cats.

140
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:46,142
No, it's not his hobby. It's just plain greed.

141
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,942
He's collecting them only because he wants money.

142
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,442
He collected them out of greed?

143
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,642
As you can see, all the cats here

144
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,442
have their right paws raised.

145
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:55,742
True.

146
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,742
Since I've seen these cats with left their left paws raised too,

147
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:58,942
in order to satisfy my curiosity

148
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,942
I personally asked him why.

149
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,742
He told me that cats with their left paw raised beckon people,

150
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,242
while ones with their right paws raised beckon money.

151
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:08,642
Please beckon money to me.

152
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,242
Never mind about beckoning people.

153
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:12,442
I don't want to waste money on having to serve them tea.

154
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,942
I mean he was nothing but a super miser.

155
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:19,642
I see, so that's the story on cats with their right paws raised.

156
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,542
Did you know that they beckon money?

157
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,942
No.

158
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:28,042
But even though I won't have to come here and clean anymore,

159
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,942
I feel like I'll kind of miss it.

160
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,742
Cleaning?

161
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,442
Excuse me, ma'am.

162
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,342
Did Mr. Kanemaru ever vacuum

163
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,842
the room himself?

164
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,442
Nope.

165
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:54,942
He used to say that it was a waste of electricity

166
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,042
so I came and did it once a week.

167
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:04,342
Hey, don't you go loitering around and get in the way of the investigation.

168
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,342
Alright.

169
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,342
Trash bag?

170
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,942
No, I didn't throw it away.

171
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:14,742
I guess it's strange because I know that Mr. Kanemaru

172
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:17,742
who doesn't clean wouldn't throw it away.

173
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,442
How about it?

174
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,342
Yes, it's definitely her.

175
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:23,942
"President's Room."

176
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:41,842
I wonder what on earth that vacuum cleaner sucked in?

177
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,442
Why was the trash bag inside the vacuum cleaner taken away?

178
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:48,442
If it were taken away, for what reason?

179
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:08,742
Well... I.O.Us that have been taken away,

180
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,942
as well as memos, with all these stuck out to her,

181
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:12,242
she can't make excuses what so ever.

182
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:15,742
I guess I'm not called for this time.

183
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,942
What's that?

184
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,742
The fingertip of the welcoming cat.

185
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,542
I found it under the sofa.

186
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:24,342
It probably came flying over here, when the killer struck him.

187
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,942
This is called a flapping clock,

188
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:33,342
and time ticks away with each flip of the flap.

189
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:36,542
What a thing to still be using in this day and age.

190
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,842
Just like Ms. Imaoka says, it sure is a rare antique.

191
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:42,242
It flew all the way here.

192
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:45,342
It's not entirely impossible.

193
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,642
No, but wait a sec.

194
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,142
No,

195
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:54,342
this didn't fly over.

196
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:55,442
I see!

197
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,842
Maybe that's why the culprit vacuumed the place.

198
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,242
But, who on earth did it?

199
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,542
She confessed to the crime?

200
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,642
And her motive?

201
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:05,742
Clothes, shoes, accessories, bags and watches.

202
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,642
It seems she was largely in debt to Mr. Kanemaru in order to buy

203
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:12,542
the brand name items that she used to make herself look rich.

204
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,942
It wasn't possible for her to repay him

205
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,642
even if she quit college and part-timed,

206
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:17,742
but today she finally...

207
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:22,042
100,000 yen. It doesn't even add up to interest.

208
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,342
My patience is wearing out, too.

209
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:25,842
I guess I'll call your parents

210
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,842
and have them help you pay me back.

211
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,642
No, don't! Please don't tell my parents.

212
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:32,442
I beg you!

213
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,542
I'm not volunteering my services or anything, you know.

214
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,742
I lent you money

215
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:37,742
and I'm going to make you pay it back.

216
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:49,542
Then, she took the I.O.U. with her and fled.

217
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:55,642
This is...

218
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,942
blood?

219
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,242
Something most surely happened in this room.

220
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,142
Yeah, the chances are high.

221
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,642
There's evidence of 1/60.

222
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:05,942
Evidence of 1/60?

223
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:09,442
Yes. Evidence of once an hour.

224
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,542
Well, then. I just remember that I've got some things to attend to

225
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,142
so I'm going home.

226
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,942
Hey, Haibara.

227
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,642
So, you took the welcoming cat,

228
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:22,842
walked over to the safe and flung it down, is that right?

229
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,142
No, that's not right.

230
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,642
This case is not that simple.

231
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:37,518
It's stopped bleeding completely.

232
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,618
Thank you.

233
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,518
But, I think you should take him to the vet once.

234
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,518
I guess so.

235
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,918
Yeah, just as I thought.

236
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,418
Conan, we're going home!

237
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,218
There's enough time to make it for the final race.

238
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,718
May I listen to it at the shop again?

239
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,718
Yes, please do.

240
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,918
Inspector, I'll be going then.

241
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,418
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,618
Don't tell me you're going to start

243
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,518
that "She's not the one who did it" bit again?

244
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:17,018
Yes, exactly, Inspector.

245
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:21,718
Ms. Chika Murai did actually strike Mr. Kanemaru with the welcoming cat

246
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,618
in this office.

247
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,918
But, she should charged for assault.

248
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:28,518
Assault? Is that it?

249
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:33,218
After being struck by Chika, Mr. Kanemaru probably fainted.

250
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:38,318
It was probably for just a very short while.

251
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,218
And at 12:40 p.m.,

252
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:44,118
Mr. Ishigami saw Chika fleeing.

253
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:51,618
However, a few minutes after that Mr. Kanemaru was struck again and killed.

254
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:54,718
You mean he was attacked twice?

255
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:58,118
Please bring the clock that is in the president's room here.

256
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,918
-Mr. Hirota. -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,718
Please set the clock back to 12:59 p.m.

258
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:10,518
This sure is an old-fashioned clock.

259
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:14,218
If I remember correct, it goes...

260
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,618
This is...

261
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:24,118
Blood that splattered from Mr. Kanemaru's head when he was hit.

262
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:26,618
Moreover, it was at the president's room next door

263
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:29,018
at 12:59 p.m.

264
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,418
In other words, she had already left the scene.

265
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:37,818
Don't tell me someone else attacked Mr. Kanemaru?

266
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:41,718
Yes, and that person's the one who killed Mr. Kanemaru.

267
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:44,418
You mean the president's room is the second murder site?

268
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:48,118
I'm sure the killer wiped the blood off on the spot,

269
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:51,418
but the face of the clock happened to change just then,

270
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,818
so he probably didn't notice the blood that splattered there.

271
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,018
I see.

272
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:59,118
And just who is that killer?

273
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:01,518
Please look at the notebook over there.

274
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:04,918
Mr. Kanemaru has left a clue behind.

275
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,718
12:30 p.m., Chika Murai.

276
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,618
Below that memo, on the next page.

277
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:14,418
It's blank. There's nothing written?

278
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:17,318
On the memo that's not there, the name of the person

279
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,118
that Mr. Kanemaru was supposed to meet right after Chika was probably written.

280
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:24,518
The killer noticed it and ripped it off.

281
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:30,318
Inspector, please try tracing over that blank sheet of paper there.

282
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,018
The slight trace of what was written should be left.

283
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,818
Words are emerging.

284
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:47,318
September 3rd, 1'o clock. Ishigami.

285
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:49,918
Mr. Ishigami,

286
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:54,318
did you have an appointment to see Mr. Kanemaru at 1 p.m. today?

287
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:55,818
Oh, yes.

288
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,618
I mean no, I did have an appointment

289
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:01,718
but, my shop got busy so I couldn't come here.

290
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,218
Conan, give the thing to the inspector.

291
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:05,618
Okay.

292
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,618
Here you go.

293
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,918
A handkerchief?

294
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:13,218
Is this blood?

295
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:17,018
Yep, it's the footprints of Cha-cha who hurt his front paw.

296
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:20,218
Inspector,

297
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:22,918
the cat footprint that you see by the window of the president's room

298
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,618
is supposed to be the same as the one you see on that handkerchief,

299
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:27,518
so please check it.

300
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:31,118
Mr. Ishigami says he didn't come

301
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,518
but Cha-cha was here.

302
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:37,818
However, it's impossible that the cat would open the door and come in.

303
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:39,618
Besides, although the window is open,

304
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,218
it is closed off with crime-preventing bars, and even a cat

305
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:46,518
wouldn't be able to jump through the bars into the room.

306
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:49,618
Just as Detective Mouri says, the footprints match.

307
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,918
The only possibility is that.

308
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,818
Cha-cha came here together with Mr. Ishigami.

309
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,818
Mr. Ishigami made an appointment to come here at 1 p.m.,

310
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,818
as was seen on the memo, and met Mr. Kanemaru.

311
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:03,818
No, I... I didn't come here.

312
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:07,718
There's something over there. I wonder what it is?

313
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:10,918
There, see under the sofa in the foreground.

314
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,418
This also seems to be a cracked piece of the welcoming cat.

315
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:21,818
Inspector, that's the cracked piece that came from the welcoming cat

316
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:24,318
that Mr. Ishigami used to kill Mr. Kanemaru.

317
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:26,018
What?

318
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,718
But, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,618
Ms. Murai says that she attacked Mr. Kanmaru

320
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,618
with the welcoming cat on this shelf.

321
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:35,318
Probably the one that over there.

322
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,118
The cracked pieces here are only of one welcoming cat,

323
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:40,918
so where's the cat that Mr. Ishigami used then?

324
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,718
Inspector Megure,

325
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:46,918
isn't the cracked piece from a welcoming cat's left paw?

326
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,418
Now that you mentioned it,

327
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:54,918
all the cats here have their right paw raised.

328
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,818
Any with the left paw raised...

329
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,718
In other words, this one unique cracked piece

330
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:05,018
is from a welcoming cat that is not normally here.

331
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,518
Are you saying that a different type of welcoming cat

332
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:08,918
was brought in here from outside?

333
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:13,218
Mr. Ishigami, you came here a little before 1 p.m. after all,

334
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,118
with a welcoming cat that had its left hand raised, didn't you?

335
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:19,818
And, that's when you witnessed Chika, isn't that right?

336
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:31,018
Mr. Kanemaru who was struck by Chika, just fainted on the spot,

337
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:32,618
but regained consciousness immediately.

338
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,818
Then...

339
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:37,818
Hello there.

340
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:39,118
Mr. Kanemaru,

341
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,918
what on earth happened here?

342
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,018
Talk about unlucky. A woman, on top of not paying back what I lent her,

343
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,818
suddenly attacked me.

344
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,818
By the way, did you come up with the money?

345
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,118
Oh, no. Not yet...

346
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,918
What?

347
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:55,618
So, I brought this as a token of my apology to you.

348
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,818
A welcoming cat, that's thoughtful of you.

349
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,718
Are you stupid or what?

350
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,718
The welcoming cats that I'm collecting all have their right paws raised,

351
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,418
and holding an old Japanese gold coin in their left paw.

352
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,618
I don't want this cat.

353
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:10,718
Go on home, and make preparations to give your shop over to me.

354
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,418
Shut up. Out of my way!

355
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,118
I tell you, first it's that woman

356
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,718
and now you...

357
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,418
How dare you make light of me.

358
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:34,918
Cha-cha, who panicked at the sight,

359
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:37,818
hurt his paw with a cracked piece from the welcoming cat

360
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:40,518
and fled outside, in fear from the window.

361
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:43,418
In the meantime, you flashed upon the idea

362
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:46,818
of framing Chika to be the killer.

363
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:50,218
You move Mr. Kanemaru's body to the office.

364
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,618
You went around searching for even the slightest amount

365
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,918
of blood you could find, and wiped them off.

366
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,718
You gathered the large cracked pieces

367
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,918
and sucked the small pieces up with the vacuum cleaner,

368
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,318
then you took the trash bag in the vacuum cleaner away.

369
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:08,718
However, unfortunately, you left a number of clues behind.

370
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:12,918
Mr. Ishigami, is he right?

371
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:15,218
Not much time has passed from the time of the crime.

372
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:18,718
The range of your activities is also limited now.

373
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,018
Therefore, it won't be too difficult

374
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:22,318
looking for the cracked piece from the murder weapon too.

375
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:26,418
Matching the fingerprints, hair and blood and doing a precise check,

376
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,218
we'll bring everything into the light.

377
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:36,318
Everything is as Detective Mouri has just said.

378
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:39,618
But, if I couldn't pay Kanemaru back by today

379
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:42,518
he would've taken my shop from me.

380
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:44,218
That's why I...

381
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,518
The welcoming cat that usually brings happiness,

382
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,418
seems have been quite different this time.

383
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:30,318
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Conan.

384
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:31,718
Come here, will you!

385
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:32,918
What?

386
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,518
Okay, just great!

387
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:37,418
Get a load of this, it's a welcoming cat that I made.

388
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,618
I made it with both paws in the air

389
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,518
so that it would beckon money as well as people.

390
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:43,918
Bravo!

391
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:46,718
My dark horse is gonna win, bravo!

392
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,318
This looks more like a give up pose to me.

393
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,118
Like in a hold-up.

394
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,918
"Next Episode" -Eisuke Hondo is secretly looking

395
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:58,518
for the whereabouts of Keil, or Rena Mizunashi,

396
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:02,018
one of the members of the Black Organization.

397
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:06,918
I asked Heiji for help to find a connection between the two.

398
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:09,918
The information I got was that Eisuke Hondo's father

399
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:13,118
was hired by the "Company".

400
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,618
If it's what I'm thinking of,

401
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:17,218
what is his true identity?

402
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:21,018
Next Conan,

403
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:24,418
"Red and Black Crash (Prologue)"

404
00:24:40,218 --> 00:24:42,218
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:46,218
"Wrong Phone Number"
