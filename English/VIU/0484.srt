1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,334
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:05,134
After the tears is the "Black Picture".

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,634
Based on the clues that Heiji Hattori presents,

4
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:08,034
a great chase for the Black Organization begins.

5
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,234
Who is the man in the picture?

6
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,634
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:13,134
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:15,134
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,691
So hot!

10
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,791
Why is it so hot?

11
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,591
I mean, trying to pick a fight on my beautiful skin or what?

12
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:21,091
Really, it's almost the end of August and yet.

13
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,091
If I knew it was going to be like this,

14
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,391
I should've hurried home like Eisuke

15
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:26,591
and basked in the cool comfort of home.

16
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,791
Huh? Eisuke did?

17
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,691
Yeah, he does that all the time now.

18
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:38,391
It's like he disappears when classes are over.

19
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,291
Could it be he likes some girl

20
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,191
who works in a store in the neighborhood or something?

21
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,691
That clumsy kid?

22
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,491
You think he keeps going to visit with some girls?

23
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,891
It's true!

24
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:51,691
No. He probably realized that

25
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:55,691
the woman is hospitalized in a hospital somewhere

26
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,591
and looking all over for her.

27
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:03,891
The woman called Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,791
who still lies unconscious,

29
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,391
a member of the Black Organization.

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:16,691
"The Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 1)"

31
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,291
Since the F.B.I's got her covered,

32
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,091
I don't think he'll be able to find her that easily,

33
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:30,391
but I still don't know who Eisuke Hondo really is.

34
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,991
Oh, the phone.

35
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:37,491
The left is for Conan, so the one on the right...

36
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,791
is for Shinichi Kudo.

37
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,891
Ran, I just remembered something,

38
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,191
so I've got to go home!

39
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,391
Okay.

40
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,391
Yes! Hello?

41
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,191
Hey, how long do I have to keep ringing?

42
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,991
Hurry up and answer the phone, idiot!

43
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,091
Sorry, Heiji.

44
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,191
I've got my reasons too.

45
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,891
And, did you find out anything?

46
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:08,091
Yeah, I caught Mr. Ootaki on his day off and had him check for me!

47
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:10,491
I told him I didn't know what was going on yet!

48
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:17,091
He checked the name list of the schools in Osaka going back 20 years,

49
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,391
but found no student by the name of Rena Mizunashi!

50
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,491
So, we both took her picture along

51
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,291
and went around the Tsutenkaku area where a woman resembling her

52
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,991
was said to have taken a picture 10 years ago

53
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,591
and asked around.

54
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,491
Although people knew that she is the announcer that's resting work now,

55
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,891
there wasn't anyone who remembered seeing her when she was young.

56
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,191
I see.

57
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,891
Well, that's all we got on her.

58
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:45,491
When I showed the picture that you forwarded me of Eisuke Hondo...

59
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,091
Bingo!

60
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,991
I ran into a person who said he knew him when he was a kid!

61
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,191
Really?

62
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,791
Yeah, it was at a Okonomiyaki shop near Tsutenkaku.

63
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,791
He seems to have frequented the shop with his father!

64
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,291
Was his "father" a normal looking person?

65
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,891
It seems that he was a reticent guy.

66
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:08,091
All I found out was that the father's name was "Hondo."

67
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,191
He was called that way.

68
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:11,391
Called that way?

69
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:15,991
Right, he seems to have come with his colleagues occasionally too.

70
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,591
It seems that he stopped coming all of a sudden

71
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:19,991
from several years ago, though.

72
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,991
What kind of "work" did he do?

73
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,391
I don't know.

74
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:26,191
But the present manager says that

75
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,391
maybe the previous manager would know.

76
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:31,591
They seemed to have gotten along.

77
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:35,091
They used be absorbed in talking even after closing time, it seems...

78
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:37,191
What were they talking about?

79
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,391
You met that manager too, didn't you?

80
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,191
I couldn't if I wanted to

81
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,591
because he's not of this world anymore.

82
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,991
Hey, don't tell me that...

83
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:47,491
It has something to do with the guys in black, does it?

84
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,591
No, no! He died of an illness. He was sick.

85
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,491
He seems to have had cancer.

86
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,691
He was pretty old too, you see.

87
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,491
Which means, that's as much information you can get?

88
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,391
No, this is where everything starts!

89
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:04,391
That manager had a grandchild he really favored.

90
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:09,091
And I was told that he may have told his grandchild everything!

91
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,291
Grandchild...

92
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,491
The grandchild went to a university in Osaka

93
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:13,991
and lived here for 4 years.

94
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:15,991
He used to frequent the shop too.

95
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,891
The grandchild is thought to have met the man you're asking about too.

96
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,491
And, where is he now?

97
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:24,291
He seems to be running a model shop in Tokyo.

98
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,691
I asked for his address and phone number.

99
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,491
If you're going to go visit him, be careful.

100
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:33,591
The father of the guy called Eisuke Hondo is no ordinary guy.

101
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,891
Huh?

102
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,991
The colleagues he used to bring to the shop

103
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:39,391
almost always changed each time he came,

104
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,591
and more than half of them were foreigners.

105
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,891
Moreover, all of them including his father,

106
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,391
seem to have been dressed in black,

107
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,791
as if they came right from a funeral.

108
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,491
Are you sure about that?

109
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:52,291
Yeah. In addition,

110
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,491
it seems that they really hated to have their pictures taken.

111
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,791
That's why their faces are unknown.

112
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,891
One more thing, it seems that the name of his father

113
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,891
used to change each time he came.

114
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,691
Tsubouchi, Ishikawa and Hondo

115
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,091
were just among the many names he used!

116
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:11,891
I see, and he was reticent because he was on his guard.

117
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:16,491
Yeah. So if this grandchild met Hondo's father,

118
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,791
it could be that...

119
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,891
The grandchild who knows their faces is probably being watched.

120
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,991
What? You don't need dinner?

121
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,991
Are you at Doc's house?

122
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,591
Okay.

123
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,791
Gosh, that Conan.

124
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,191
By the way, where's dad?

125
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:39,091
What? You're going to do some checking on Eisuke Hondo?

126
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,191
-From now? -Yeah, right now!

127
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,291
To be exact, I'm going to see a person

128
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,391
who knows Eisuke Hondo's father, that is!

129
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,291
-Are you going to be all right? -I'll be fine.

130
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,491
I already told Ran that I'll be sleeping over at your place too.

131
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,891
That's not what I meant!

132
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,291
That man is connected with the men in black, isn't he?

133
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,191
That's why I'm in a rush!

134
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,391
If I dilly-dally, she may find out about this

135
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,091
and say she wants to come along too.

136
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,691
-She? -The one who's taking a bath now.

137
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,491
Oh, did you call me?

138
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,091
She's already out.

139
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:18,391
Oh, yes. I was asked by your grandfather when he was still alive

140
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:21,491
to hand something over to a man he had close relationship with,

141
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:24,991
who used to frequent the shop.

142
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,691
I have a pretty good idea who that person is,

143
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,591
but I just want to confirm it.

144
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:34,091
Something about this being a very important thing.

145
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,791
You mean the customer that used to always bring his son along?

146
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:41,491
Oh, that's right.

147
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,991
Do happen to know his name or the place that he works?

148
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,091
No. After all, I only met him 2 or 3 times myself.

149
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:50,991
Then, do you remember any characteristic about him?

150
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,291
There are 2 or 3 people that I also have in mind here too.

151
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,191
I can't remember just like that right now.

152
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:00,691
Would you like to take a look at a picture of that person?

153
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,191
Huh? Do you have his picture?

154
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:06,391
I heard that he hated to have his picture taken.

155
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,091
Right, but this picture was taken coincidentally.

156
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,791
It seems that his son was playing around with the camera

157
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,191
and took the picture.

158
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,991
May I go over to take a look at the picture now?

159
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,491
Now?

160
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,091
I'm going to close at 7:00 tonight

161
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:23,791
and going to the sports gym after that,

162
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,291
so by the time I get home, it'll be past 11:00 p.m..

163
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,891
That's okay! I'll be waiting in front of your place.

164
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,291
Oh, well, okay, never mind the gym.

165
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,491
I'll go straight home!

166
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,691
Are you sure?

167
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,691
Yes, I'd like to hear about grandpa too

168
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:37,991
because it's been such a long time.

169
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,891
Thank you very much.

170
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,791
Strange. It's way past the promised 8:00.

171
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,391
Just as I was told, this is the right place, though.

172
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,291
I'll go check!

173
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,591
Stay here, Ai!

174
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,991
The room number is...

175
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,791
Room 302.

176
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,291
I told you to stay in the car, didn't I?

177
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,791
No one's in.

178
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,691
Strange...

179
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,391
Hey.

180
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,791
-What the? -Doc?

181
00:10:56,591 --> 00:11:00,991
It's amazing you found your way all the way here.

182
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,591
Gramps.

183
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:21,122
This is a model gun that I sell at my shop.

184
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,722
See, take a good look and you can see that the muzzle is sealed.

185
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:30,222
-You're the one who called a while ago, right? -Yes.

186
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,322
Well...

187
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,722
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -I thought if you were grandpa's acquaintance,

188
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:35,222
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -you could easily take a joke like this.

189
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:38,622
Grandpa is a gun and suspense freak that's second to none.

190
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:42,422
Whenever I saw him, this is the kind of welcome I got.

191
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:45,622
Oh. Right, I see.

192
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,122
It was so out of the blue that I inadvertently was surprised.

193
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:54,022
I see, he waited outside till we came to ring the doorbell

194
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,722
just so he could do this.

195
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:59,722
Who are those children?

196
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:02,622
Oh, my grandchildren. They insisted on coming along.

197
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,122
Shouldn't I have?

198
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,322
No, it's okay.

199
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,922
It's really quite messy, but please come in.

200
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:26,822
Wow, talk about really messy...

201
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,622
The slippers are distorted out of shape.

202
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,922
I'm sorry, but could I use the restroom?

203
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:35,122
Yeah. Here.

204
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:45,022
It sure is hot.

205
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:52,222
It was pretty humid this afternoon too.

206
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,922
I guess heat had no way of escaping the room.

207
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:59,522
And, the album I'm sure was on the very top.

208
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,122
Huh, it's not here.

209
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,322
I'm sure I put in here.

210
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,822
It's wet.

211
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,522
Is it water?

212
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,822
Wet tissue paper...

213
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:27,722
Don't you have the picture in your computer?

214
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,122
Right!

215
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,122
I'll get it out now, so hold on.

216
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:39,222
Huh? The data's gone.

217
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:40,622
Strange.

218
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:43,222
I don't remember deleting it,

219
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,822
and yet, why?

220
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:51,022
I'm sure that somebody snuck into this room.

221
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:58,022
Moreover, that person was here till just a while ago.

222
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,722
What? Somebody suck into this room?

223
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:04,822
And was here till just a while ago... Oh, no.

224
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,022
There is several evidence of it.

225
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,722
Take the slippers for example.

226
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,422
The slippers by the front entrance

227
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:13,022
are thrown out just like that and scattered.

228
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:16,022
Here.

229
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,322
When you came back here from work,

230
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:22,422
only the slippers in the toilet were nicely in place.

231
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,522
That means that it is highly probable that somebody besides you

232
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:28,422
used the restroom while you were out, doesn't it?

233
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:33,322
Yeah, but I place the toilet slippers neatly in place sometimes too.

234
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:34,722
Only "sometimes", right?

235
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,622
Not "always for sure", right?

236
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,122
I guess so.

237
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:41,722
That's enough to suspect that someone was here, then!

238
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,622
The next thing that caught my eye was...

239
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:48,522
the drops water on the floor.

240
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,822
Water?

241
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,322
See?

242
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,722
It's hard to tell what it is just by looking at it.

243
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,322
But, judging from the fact that

244
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:01,022
it is especially wet around the desk and in front of the shelf,

245
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:02,122
as well as taking into consideration that

246
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:05,322
the tissue paper in the wastebasket is damp.

247
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:10,122
It's most likely that this small amount of water is

248
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,422
the sweat of none other than the person who snuck in here!

249
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:14,822
Sweat?

250
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,022
I see.

251
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:18,122
Whoever it was that snuck in here in the afternoon

252
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:19,722
in this stuffy hot room perspired profusely,

253
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,322
and used the tissue paper to wipe off all the sweating,

254
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,822
then threw the tissue away into the trash can.

255
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,422
Even so, his sweat poured down on the floor

256
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,322
where he most probably stopped to look,

257
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,722
that is, where the bookshelf and desk are.

258
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,922
But, if he was that hot,

259
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,022
he could've turned on the air conditioner, couldn't he?

260
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,222
Yeah.

261
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:40,822
After all, I leave all the lights in the room on when I'm out,

262
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:44,422
and I always leave the remote controller of the air conditioner on the desk.

263
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,822
So, it's not hard to find.

264
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:50,322
No. He deliberately didn't turn the air conditioner on,

265
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:54,022
because if the room is cool when you get back,

266
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:56,722
you'd get suspicious, right?

267
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,822
Besides it's hard to accurately tell

268
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:03,122
how long it would take for the room that has been cooled

269
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:05,022
to return to the original temperature.

270
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,722
True...

271
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:08,522
And the most conclusive evidence is

272
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:11,622
the main unit of the computer that is slightly warm yet.

273
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:15,122
You switched it on just now,

274
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:19,122
and yet isn't it strange that the area around the CPU is already warn?

275
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:21,622
Hey, don't tell me that the guy is after...

276
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:24,622
Yes, I think it's the picture!

277
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:28,322
The one that you said you'd be showing us.

278
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:32,322
And the picture that may be of the man I'm looking for.

279
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,422
After all, the data in the computer is gone

280
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,122
and the album that was supposed to be on the bookshelf

281
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,622
isn't there, right?

282
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,122
By the way, the reason I said that

283
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,522
I think the person was here till just a while ago

284
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:24,322
is because the sweat on the floor in this stuffy hot room,

285
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:28,022
as well as the damp tissue paper that was used to wipe it.

286
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,622
The surface area of the droplets,

287
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,622
the temperature and humidity of the room...

288
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:32,622
The room was completely closed off

289
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:35,322
and there was no wind blowing through what so ever.

290
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,322
There was also the smell of leftover food.

291
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:42,922
And deducing from how dried the drops of sweat are on the floor,

292
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:47,422
I think that someone was here till just 10 minutes ago.

293
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:51,722
Who the heck are you, anyway, kid?

294
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,422
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

295
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,722
Detective!

296
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:57,022
The question is,

297
00:17:57,022 --> 00:18:00,122
how the person snuck in here and who it was.

298
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:03,722
It doesn't look as if the door was forced opened or anything.

299
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:05,622
The little window in the kitchen is locked

300
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,622
and everything looks normal.

301
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:11,222
Which means the culprit snuck in from some place other than this room.

302
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,822
The room on this side. I'm going in.

303
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,422
Are these the only two rooms, one here and the one there?

304
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:24,822
Yeah.

305
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:28,222
The curtain...

306
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:35,122
The window is open.

307
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:38,522
Then, the person came in from there. How careless!

308
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:42,122
Well, I leave that window open all the time.

309
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,322
I always make georama in this room,

310
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:48,822
so I color and glue the parts as well as shave them off,

311
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,522
so there's a lot of dust.

312
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:54,022
That's why I always try to air the room out.

313
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:57,322
Besides, take a look at the street below.

314
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,822
There are quite a few shops

315
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,122
and a lot of people go through this street.

316
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,522
If someone were to use a rope to go in and out of here,

317
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,722
somebody is bound to notice right away.

318
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:08,622
Well, I guess it's possible if it were in the middle of the night,

319
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:11,122
but it's still a little before 9:00 in the evening.

320
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:18,122
Then, does it mean that the person didn't sneak in from there?

321
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,522
No, it's impossible to, from here!

322
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:23,322
More so in broad daylight.

323
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:24,922
I'm more concerned about you guys

324
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,322
than about somebody having broken in here.

325
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,022
Huh?

326
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,222
I let you in this room because you said that

327
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:32,022
you wanted to give someone who patronized grandpa's shop

328
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,422
something that grandpa asked you to give that customer.

329
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,122
That's why I figured that I should show you a picture.

330
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:36,922
But you walk in here

331
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,422
and there's this boy who claims he's a detective.

332
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,622
He starts searching all over my room.

333
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,922
I really don't feel all that comfortable, you see.

334
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:47,022
If you have an idea of who that customer is,

335
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,522
all you gotta do is show the stuff

336
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,222
that grandpa gave you to the people you contact,

337
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,722
and say, "This is from grandpa, but do you know something about it!"

338
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:57,422
Well, that's...

339
00:19:58,522 --> 00:19:59,822
A wallet!

340
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:03,122
It's a big wallet with a lot of money inside it.

341
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,722
Wallet?

342
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:07,222
A wallet...

343
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:11,222
Right, that's right. It's a wallet.

344
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:14,222
It seems the person forgot it at the shop.

345
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,822
But since it involves money,

346
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:20,022
people may claim it's theirs even if it's not.

347
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,922
I guess it can't be helped if it's a wallet.

348
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:27,222
By the way, does anyone have the spare key to this room?

349
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,622
Well, there are. Three people do.

350
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:33,022
Who are they?

351
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:36,022
One of them is my ex-girlfriend, Saori.

352
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,122
She used to come here a lot.

353
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:40,822
It sure was fun when she was around.

354
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,422
Come to think of it, I still haven't got the key back from her.

355
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:49,522
The other two are my model making friends, Tago and Furusho.

356
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:51,522
Whenever a georama tournament is approaches,

357
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,222
I have the two help me out.

358
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,722
I gave them the key to this room so they can come and go as they please.

359
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:00,322
The three people who can easily go in and out of this room

360
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,722
are those three.

361
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:06,122
But none of them are inclined to commit theft.

362
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:08,122
Will you please call them

363
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,222
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

364
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:11,622
Okay.

365
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:14,422
-Hey. -Conan.

366
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:19,822
How come you're not calling the police right away?

367
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:23,022
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

368
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:25,722
Not a member of the Black Organization.

369
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:28,522
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

370
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:32,722
Maybe they were flustered because the resident suddenly came back?

371
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,922
Because remember, he was supposed to be

372
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:37,422
at the sports gym until 11:00 tonight,

373
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,622
but he suddenly changed his mind.

374
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:42,722
If so, that somebody still should've been in this room

375
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:45,322
when we came in.

376
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:47,722
Well, even if somebody were to be standing guard

377
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:49,922
and notified the person inside...

378
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,122
They would most likely ambush and kill,

379
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,422
rather than leave so much evidence behind.

380
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:01,922
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

381
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,122
If the police come and start interrogation,

382
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:07,522
they'll find out immediately that

383
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,122
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

384
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:10,822
So, before that,

385
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,522
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

386
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:16,422
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

387
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:19,722
I've got to get it back...

388
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:23,722
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

389
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:56,722
"Next Episode."

390
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:58,322
It's damp.

391
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,822
What?

392
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:03,322
In front of your very eyes...

393
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,722
Don't tell me that it's in this room?

394
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:09,122
Yeah, it's... that!

395
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,222
Don't tell me...

396
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:15,922
Company!

397
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:23,522
Next Conan, "Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 2)"

398
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:41,322
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:43,622
"Washing machine."

400
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:46,122
-Doc, your laundry... -Thank you always, Ai.

401
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,122
I wish you'd do it yourself!

402
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:48,922
What a hard-boiled attitude.
