1
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,629
Today's stage is at an ordinary apartment complex.

2
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,829
Is it an accident or a homicide?

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,829
There is a blind spot that cannot be seen in ordinary life.

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,329
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,129
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,030
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:05,605
Move it!

8
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,206
You, get out of here!

9
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:12,006
You crows sure a nuisance, I tell you.

10
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:28,606
Shoots. There's not much of anything here.

11
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:16,106
"City Crows."

12
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,306
I think something happened.

13
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:30,605
I wonder what kind of case it is?

14
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:33,305
Hey, no, stand back.

15
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,905
What's with you, kids?

16
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:38,005
Please give us the details, Officer Chiba.

17
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,906
No.

18
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,005
-That's... -A homicide?

19
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,405
Homicide?

20
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:49,406
-Just as I thought! -How frightening!

21
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:52,305
No! It's not a murder case, it's an accident!

22
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,405
An accident?

23
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,405
You guys are really something.

24
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:59,305
To be honest, someone died.

25
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,305
It was a grandma who used to live here alone.

26
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:04,205
Her name is Tatsue Egami.

27
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,405
When she was coming back home,

28
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:11,006
a flower pot happened to fall and hit her on the head.

29
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,605
That fell on her head?

30
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:17,306
But where did it fall from?

31
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,905
Hanging them like that is dangerous.

32
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,405
It's not strange if it fell anytime.

33
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,805
That's unacceptable.

34
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:30,305
What kind of person is living there?

35
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,405
Room 404.

36
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,705
It's the apartment that the late Tatsue Egami lived in.

37
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:41,605
So, that grandma got hit in the head by the plant she was growing?

38
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:44,205
That is what we believe happened.

39
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:47,405
That's too bad for that Grandma.

40
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:50,205
It's true that it's bad for her, but...

41
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,305
Officer Chiba!

42
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:52,605
How was it?

43
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:55,805
The neighbors tried to warn her about the danger.

44
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:59,405
They asked her to put the pots inside,

45
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:02,005
but she didn't listen to them.

46
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:05,105
I see. So if she had listened,

47
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,005
this wouldn't have happened because of crows.

48
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,805
Crows?

49
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,205
Don't you see them?

50
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,006
They're everywhere.

51
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,705
Since it's on the 4th floor,

52
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:22,005
it's not likely that a stray cat did it.

53
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,905
One of those probably dropped the planter

54
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,006
with either their beak or feet.

55
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:39,005
Crows sure are strong, aren't they?

56
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,105
I wonder if the crow is really the one who did this?

57
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:44,005
There are no witnesses.

58
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,305
Since it was early in the morning,

59
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,205
there seems to have been no one around, too.

60
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:50,006
Maybe someone who lives opposite here saw something.

61
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:59,205
Right. As you can see, it's impossible.

62
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,905
To be killed by a crow,

63
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:03,505
I'm starting to feel more and more sorry for granny.

64
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,805
There are people making sarcastic remarks

65
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:08,605
like a crow was killed by a crow.

66
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,805
A crow killed by a crow?

67
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:16,505
It seems that Tatsue Egami was called "grandmother crow" behind her back.

68
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,505
Grandmother crow?

69
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,505
She used to go out early in the morning to make her rounds

70
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,805
going through the trash that other people threw out.

71
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,706
Moreover, she seems to have always worn only black clothes.

72
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:32,305
That's why she was called grandmother crow, huh?

73
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:35,005
She had a pretty bad reputation, too.

74
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,205
They couldn't stand her going through their trash

75
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,605
and invading their privacy.

76
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,705
There even seems to have been people who moved out.

77
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:45,305
She was disliked by everyone in the apartment complex.

78
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:49,305
But why did she do such a thing as go through other people's trash?

79
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:51,906
Yeah. Well, what triggered it was...

80
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:02,706
Gosh! How messy!

81
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,205
The lottery ticket she found

82
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:14,006
happened to be one for 3rd place or something.

83
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:18,605
So, she seems to have thought she could find something valuable again.

84
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,705
That seems to have been the beginning of her reason

85
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,005
for going through trash.

86
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:25,305
"Dream come to me once more..." She hoped, I guess.

87
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,605
They took on revenge on her

88
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,505
because she went around looking into other people's trash.

89
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,905
Revenge?

90
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,905
The crow got mad

91
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,805
thinking that she was going to take away their food.

92
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,305
That's why the crow dropped the planter.

93
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,705
I see. The crow took revenge because it involved food.

94
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:46,005
It's possible because crows are smart.

95
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,905
The old lady seems to have made her rounds

96
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,705
of the trash dumps this morning, too.

97
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,705
And when she came back to the 1st floor doorway

98
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,005
in order to return to her room,

99
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,906
the planter seems to have fell from above.

100
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:06,405
But isn't it strange?

101
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:10,005
The old lady came home from outside, didn't she?

102
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,905
From that side then this way, right?

103
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,505
Then she was going to enter that entrance.

104
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,905
Yeah.

105
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:20,705
I wonder how she came from in front of the entrance to this side?

106
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,205
Come to think of it, you're right.

107
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:25,305
True. If she did go this way,

108
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:29,005
even if the planter came falling, it wouldn't have hit her.

109
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:32,505
The fact is, we thought that was strange too,

110
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,805
the minute we got here.

111
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:39,105
The refrigerator which was put outside as trash...

112
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:41,505
I mean, because one of her hands was inserted under it,

113
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,206
and she was lying dead in a strange position.

114
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:48,105
But we figured the reason out

115
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,005
after we looked under the refrigerator.

116
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:53,006
In other words, when she came back...

117
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,306
Oh, no!

118
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,405
And tried to retrieve her coin,

119
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:15,306
the mischievous crow dropped the planter.

120
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,605
Judging from the circumstances, this is probably what happened.

121
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,105
Convincing.

122
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,706
I really feel sorry for the old lady.

123
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:29,305
I wonder if such a coincidence exists.

124
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,105
She happens to drop her coin and it just happens

125
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:33,505
to roll under the refrigerator that is put out as trash.

126
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,306
Right above her is a row of planters are lined up.

127
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:38,605
And just as she tries to retrieve her coin,

128
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,606
the crow just so happens to drop the planter.

129
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,506
Hey!

130
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,806
"Closed for Safety."

131
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,405
You can't make it out to the roof.

132
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,806
If so...

133
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:16,706
What's up, Conan?

134
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:25,406
The only way it can be done is from that room on the 5th floor.

135
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:28,106
"504: Imai, 404: Egami."

136
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,305
You're...

137
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,405
Ms. Imai.

138
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:34,305
Thank you just a while ago.

139
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,605
Thank you for doing your rounds.

140
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,105
Have a nice day.

141
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,606
Huh?

142
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,806
Good morning.

143
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,806
Good morning.

144
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,405
Ayumi, do you know her?

145
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,805
Well, she looks very familiar, but...

146
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:59,905
She lives right above that old lady's room, right?

147
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,305
Yeah. We asked her if she saw anything

148
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:05,905
during our investigation.

149
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,905
Does she live with her family?

150
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:12,405
No. I heard she was living alone.

151
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,405
But, is something about her bothering you?

152
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:17,305
I'll bet you fell in love at first sight with her.

153
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:20,806
Do you like older women like her?

154
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,505
I wonder who she is.

155
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,506
I know I met her somewhere before.

156
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,905
What? This is not an accident?

157
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,806
But a homicide?

158
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:46,205
Yes. If the crow hooked its feet onto the planter,

159
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,805
it would have fell upside down or diagonally.

160
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:52,906
Naturally, if the planter fell on her head, it would crack to pieces.

161
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:56,305
But that planter was cracked

162
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:59,006
as if it had fallen bottom first.

163
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,505
Which means

164
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:05,205
it came falling straight down.

165
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:08,405
In other words, the planter was not hooked by the crow,

166
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,706
but rather, removed from the fence and dropped.

167
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:19,406
Only humans can do something like this.

168
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:32,373
But, then who killed granny?

169
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:35,273
The person living on the top floor.

170
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,874
What?

171
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,473
She's the only one who could've done it.

172
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,873
I checked and found that nobody can go out to the roof.

173
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:48,373
The one who can hang a planter from granny's window

174
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,373
is the one who lives on the floor right above her.

175
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,974
No one other than her could.

176
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:56,874
It's true that you can't do it from a lower floor.

177
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,573
Please wait, Conan!

178
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:03,073
It's true that she can hang a planter, but...

179
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,773
You're going to ask why granny was under the window, right?

180
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:12,173
Yes, because granny went there only because she dropped her coin

181
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:15,173
and it rolled under the refrigerator.

182
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,173
In other words, it was a coincidence.

183
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,174
Right!

184
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,773
It's true that, that part was a coincidence.

185
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:23,673
If so, your deduction won't work out, Conan.

186
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:26,173
Because you can't possibly bring your target

187
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:29,173
to the place of your choice.

188
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,273
Yes, you can.

189
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,973
How?

190
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:36,173
Well, I've been thinking from morning, but I still don't know.

191
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:39,773
-But I'm certain. -Wrong, Conan!

192
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:41,973
She's not the kind of person

193
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,773
who would do a frightening thing like that.

194
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,373
She's kind.

195
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:48,773
So, do you know her after all, Ayumi?

196
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,473
She wasn't wearing the usual uniform so I didn't recognize her,

197
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:53,073
but now I remember.

198
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:56,474
If I'm not mistaken, she works at the bakery in front of the station.

199
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,073
So, you're still in 1st grade.

200
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:06,173
Yes, I go to Teitan Elementary.

201
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:09,673
You're really fantastic being able to run errands.

202
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:12,573
No, not really. Anybody can do this.

203
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:15,173
Here you go. Thank you for waiting.

204
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:19,873
When I was in 1st grade, I was kind of dense.

205
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,873
Same here. That's how most of us are in 1st grade.

206
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,274
Right, that's how most of us are.

207
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:30,674
I was so embarrassed, so I haven't been to that shop since then.

208
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:33,973
She was nice enough to remember me.

209
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,473
I don't see how you can suspect someone as nice as her.

210
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,073
It's not a very good

211
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,174
to suspect people right off the bat like that, Conan!

212
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,773
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

213
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,774
-Conan! -Conan!

214
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:58,673
No matter how much you think, there is no way to lure the old lady

215
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:01,173
to come right below the window.

216
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,673
The poor granny was accidentally killed

217
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:06,873
by a mischievous crow, after all.

218
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:11,674
No, there's got to be a way.

219
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:19,773
Hey, sonny, it's dangerous!

220
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,574
Could you wait a while?

221
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,074
So, that's the story.

222
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,673
What's the matter, Conan?

223
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,073
I've figured out

224
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:40,773
how she lured granny to go below the window.

225
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,774
It's this.

226
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,773
What's that?

227
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,773
Don't tell me that this is...

228
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,873
Yeah. It's the thing

229
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:51,474
that Grandmother Crow wouldn't miss for the world.

230
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,073
Conan and the others really get me mad.

231
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:00,674
How dare they suspect such a nice and kind lady.

232
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,374
Gosh! They're still investigating something on her!

233
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:11,674
Excuse me. About that lady that works at the bakery over there...

234
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:14,573
Ayumi.

235
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,773
You know, Conan, how sad do you think a person would feel

236
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,773
if she's suspected when there's no proof?

237
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:21,973
Cut it out already!

238
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,773
Well, you see, Ayumi...

239
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,873
We've found the evidence.

240
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:28,473
What?

241
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:29,674
No way...

242
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,173
Did you want anything with me?

243
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:46,073
About yesterday...

244
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:50,273
Can you show me your lottery ticket?

245
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:52,973
You bought a lottery ticket yesterday, didn't you?

246
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,673
Just one ticket at the lottery ticket sales booth near the bakery.

247
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:57,474
Please show me that.

248
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:01,374
You have it, don't you?

249
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,873
Please show it to us.

250
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,674
You have it with you, don't you?

251
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:13,773
-It's okay already, Ayumi. -Yes.

252
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,173
But...

253
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:19,973
It wasn't an accident that the planter came falling and hit granny.

254
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:23,073
Ayumi, although you insist that it can't be,

255
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,673
the only thing thinkable is that

256
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:27,074
the lady living in that room above did it.

257
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:44,673
She hooked up granny's planter and got hold of it.

258
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:47,673
Next, you dropped a long string down to the floor.

259
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:49,873
Then you stuck the lottery ticket that you bought

260
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:52,573
on the tip of the string

261
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:56,273
and put it by the entrance

262
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,774
and waited for granny to return.

263
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:14,273
When granny tried to pick the lottery ticket up,

264
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,074
you pulled the string.

265
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:23,373
That way, you can position the granny at exactly where you needed.

266
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:26,673
I don't think you could see granny's head

267
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:29,874
because of the over-sized refrigerator.

268
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:57,674
All you had left to do was retrieve the lottery ticket, right?

269
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:08,373
The 500 yen was something that you had put there to begin with,

270
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:11,473
to camouflage an unnatural situation, right?

271
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:13,373
I couldn't figure it out at first,

272
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:17,273
but when the trash collectors came a while ago,

273
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,774
I noticed the traces of a string underneath the refrigerator.

274
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:27,974
Moreover, the ripped part of the lottery ticket was found there, too.

275
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,073
With the torn piece of lottery ticket,

276
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:35,774
I'm sure we'll find your fingerprints on it.

277
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:39,073
It's okay.

278
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,574
You don't have to go out of your way to look for the fingerprints.

279
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:48,974
But, why? Why did you kill granny?

280
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,974
She made me look like a fool, at the bakery I work for.

281
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,873
See, see.

282
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:05,073
I read your letter. What a laugh this letter is.

283
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:06,974
Look at it.

284
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,473
Why do you have that?

285
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,274
I ripped it and threw it away.

286
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,373
Oh, my trash.

287
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,073
That's right, you're grandmother crow.

288
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:19,273
You got it from the trash.

289
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:20,574
Give it back to me!

290
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:32,273
What are you so worked up about?

291
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,474
I'm going to enjoy myself with this letter for a while.

292
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:44,774
It was a letter of goodbye from my boyfriend.

293
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,973
How cruel.

294
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:52,173
I was trying to forget him.

295
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:53,973
But she had the nerve to go out of her way to pick it up

296
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:56,673
and laugh about it on top of showing it to others!

297
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:57,974
But...

298
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:05,873
You're still little, so you may not understand.

299
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:09,173
But you'll eventually find out

300
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,473
that there are things that people cannot forgive

301
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:16,473
even if it seems to be very trivial.

302
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:19,873
But no matter how unforgivable,

303
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:23,274
you're not supposed to take other people's lives, Noriko!

304
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,674
You're right.

305
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,373
Will you please accept this?

306
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,974
I can't possibly take it with me, so...

307
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,174
What is it?

308
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:05,773
I understand

309
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:09,674
how sad you must've been at that time even if I'm a child.

310
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,873
But...

311
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,974
what's bad is bad!

312
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:21,274
Exactly, Ayumi.

313
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:28,374
City crows sure are sinners.

314
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:02,473
"Next Episode."

315
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,573
It was the man we saw just a while ago!

316
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:05,773
Which means that...

317
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:09,073
The two cases are not related to each other in any way.

318
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,474
It can only be explained as a case of "synchronicity".

319
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:16,473
If Takehiko was really killed,

320
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:19,673
it would have nothing to do with the case in Beika-cho.

321
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,474
Right, everything fits in too well.

322
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:28,974
Next Conan, "A Case of Synchronicity (Part 1)"

323
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,173
Next Conan's Hint:

324
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,373
"Twins."

325
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:50,573
The next episode has to do with synchronicity.

326
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,574
It means something that occurs at the same time,

327
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,874
that is, to attune to something.
