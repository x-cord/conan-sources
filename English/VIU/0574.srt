1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:04,527
Heiji and Kazuha came to Tokyo

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:06,627
to get back Kazuha's lucky charm

3
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:09,927
that Heiji hand mistakenly given away.

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,127
The person that the charm was given to was Mr. Teruaki Kunimatsu

5
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:15,927
who had broken his left arm during tennis practice

6
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:18,927
and was staying over at his friend's place.

7
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,227
Mr. Kunimatsu was found

8
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:25,327
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -assaulted and battered by someone

9
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,927
"Teitan University second-year student" -in the restroom of a sports cafe.

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,427
Heiji and I who started investigation along with Officer Takagi,

11
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:34,527
narrowed the suspects down to three people.

12
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:35,627
Moreover,

13
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:38,627
we found that the sports match that Mr. Kunimatsu watched in the afternoon

14
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:41,727
seemed to have something to do with the incident.

15
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:45,027
However, we didn't know which match he watched.

16
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:48,127
All three of the suspects

17
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:50,627
watched a sports match in the afternoon.

18
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,427
I'm sure that a clue that leads to the culprit

19
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,127
can be found in the testimony of the three suspects!

20
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,527
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,527
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,627
The mystery of the case is finally solved.

23
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:07,827
What on earth was inside Kazuha's lucky charm?

24
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,527
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,527
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,527
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,319
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 2)".

28
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:05,428
I guess all three did go to watch an exciting game,

29
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:10,528
but unless we figure out what game Mr. Kunimatsu went to watch today...

30
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,428
Yeah.

31
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:15,228
Didn't you find anything in his wallet?

32
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,928
Like the cut off half of a ticket for a game or something.

33
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:20,128
No. Besides a some money and credit cards,

34
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,528
just a lucky charm.

35
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,628
Coming up is pro baseball news!

36
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:27,428
Here are the highlights from the day game.

37
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,528
Maybe he went to a baseball match?

38
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:32,428
You see, maybe he actually went to watch a baseball game

39
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,328
but lied about it?

40
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,628
I see!

41
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:36,828
If something happened between

42
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:40,328
the culprit and Mr. Kunimatsu that caused the problem,

43
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:43,328
he would never say that he went to watch a baseball game!

44
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:48,428
But the day game for baseball was just this game,

45
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,828
a plain game with a lot of errors.

46
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:52,028
The only thing good about it was that

47
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,228
at the bottom half of the 9th inning...

48
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,028
Hold it!

49
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,628
Well, since the customers left,

50
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,828
I decided to clean the table.

51
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:03,828
I wish you wouldn't clean up without asking first!

52
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,628
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -It's still got popcorn inside.

53
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:09,628
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -Then, will you bring my half eaten hot dog

54
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,628
back to me after heating it up again!

55
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,128
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -Then, the same with my beer.

56
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:16,128
All right.

57
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:19,428
So, what was I talking about?

58
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,628
The day game! The day game!

59
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,128
Why would it be a day game if it were baseball?

60
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,328
If around here,

61
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,628
they had a night game at Yokohama too, didn't they?

62
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,128
Idiot!

63
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,828
When Mr. Kunimatsu made a phone call saying, "This is just great!

64
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,828
Luck has come my way at last! I'll show you proof from now".

65
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,828
It was sundown, you know!

66
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:40,428
So, it had to be a game that was held in the day time, right?

67
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:41,728
I guess so.

68
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,628
Besides, when I checked using my cell phone a while ago,

69
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,828
the score for this game was 1 to 5.

70
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,828
A player for the team that was making errors and losing

71
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:54,728
finally struck just one homerun at the bottom half of the 9th inning.

72
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,228
He would never say something like "This is just great!"

73
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,128
watching a shabby game like this, would he?

74
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,428
At any rate,

75
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,528
the games that were played in the day time

76
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,828
were sumo wrestling, beach volleyball, soccer,

77
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:10,328
the baseball game and golf.

78
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,728
Then, maybe it was golf?

79
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,028
If I remember correctly,

80
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:16,228
it seems to have been a very exciting game

81
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:19,028
where the game took a complete turn at the final hole.

82
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,828
But that course is a bit far from here, you see.

83
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:23,828
If after watching that match,

84
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,628
if you were to try to make it to this sports cafe by 20:00,

85
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,828
it would be pretty difficult.

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,628
According to the employee,

87
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,528
Mr. Kunimatsu seems to have come to the shop

88
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:35,928
about an hour before the incident occurred, so...

89
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,628
There's no clue.

90
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:41,928
There's no way of knowing who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up.

91
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,228
-Wrong. -Wrong.

92
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,428
-We already know who the culprit is! -We already know who the culprit is!

93
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,828
-No way. -Are you serious?

94
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,128
If you know who it is,

95
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,228
why don't you hurry and tell everybody about it,

96
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,628
and solve the case?

97
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:58,028
If you find that the lucky charm has nothing to do with the case,

98
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,528
you'll give it right back, won't you?

99
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,328
Yeah...

100
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,928
What's with you, all hung up on a lucky charm all the while?

101
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,128
Mr. Kunimatsu was beaten up

102
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:07,928
despite having the lucky charm on him, you know?

103
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,928
It's not all that effective!

104
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,828
That's a lucky charm that's effective only for me!

105
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,928
So, who's the culprit?

106
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:18,428
You know who it is, don't you?

107
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:21,128
But we don't have proof yet.

108
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,828
You don't have any?

109
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:25,628
-Right? -Yeah.

110
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,528
Talking about proof,

111
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:32,428
I wonder what it was that Kunimatsu was saying he was going to show me.

112
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,428
Yes, I wonder.

113
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,628
The first thing that comes to mind

114
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,928
as evidence of a great match is

115
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:44,028
a picture taken by cell phone when a put on a good play.

116
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,628
But no such pictures were found in his cell phone.

117
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:50,928
Maybe he got the autograph of a player

118
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,028
that performed really well in the match.

119
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:56,528
Although Kunimatsu liked sports,

120
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,828
the only time he'd get carried away asking for an autograph

121
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:02,728
is from a tennis player, because he himself plays tennis too.

122
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,528
Golfer Sho Mikawa shoots a Chip in Eagle at the final 18th hole

123
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,428
turning the game over, and winning the match!

124
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:16,328
I see, so that's the story.

125
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:21,128
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend over to this sports cafe.

126
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:25,028
In order to show him the conclusive evidence.

127
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,328
He didn't imagine that the person...

128
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,628
Would be taking a picture of it on the cell phone.

129
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,228
Is there still something else?

130
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:41,328
I would like to start heading on home.

131
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,028
It's already past 22:00.

132
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,028
We already told you everything that we know too.

133
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:50,128
You did a body check a while ago too,

134
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:53,028
but nothing came out, right?

135
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:57,028
But the only customers with no alibi are you three, you see...

136
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,628
Hey, hey! You don't have proof

137
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,728
and yet you still intend to keep us here?

138
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,828
If you want to go home that badly,

139
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,928
just go.

140
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,028
Of course,

141
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:11,328
I'm talking about the two who aren't the culprit, though.

142
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,328
Then, does it mean you found the evidence?

143
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:20,128
Yeah. We've got the culprit as well as the proof.

144
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:22,428
Really? Conan!

145
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,828
Yes, it seems so,

146
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:27,528
rather, why are you asking me?

147
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,328
If anybody, you should be asking Heiji, right?

148
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:34,928
Well, you mentioned a while ago that you knew who the culprit is too,

149
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,328
so I had a feeling that you might also

150
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:41,728
know what the evidence is.

151
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,228
But I wonder, why I thought so?

152
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:48,128
Of course, I'd know!

153
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,628
Because the culprit

154
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:55,428
said something strange that even a kid like me saw through.

155
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:57,328
Something a child would even know...

156
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,128
Something strange?

157
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:04,728
The comments on the games the three said they watched today.

158
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,828
There was one person that said something strange, wasn't there?

159
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:10,928
Well, if I remember correctly...

160
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:14,428
Mr. Kazuo Satsumo watched Sumo wrestling and...

161
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,828
Well, it was a good match

162
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,828
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

163
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,428
so I was vexed.

164
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:25,328
Mr. Kengo Haruto watched beach volleyball.

165
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:27,028
It was a succession of close games

166
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,728
and sure was a lot of fun!

167
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:32,328
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

168
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,928
Mr. Takuya Kyuma watched soccer.

169
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,528
I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

170
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:42,828
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

171
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:47,128
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

172
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,828
I can't really think of something that's strange.

173
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:54,028
Isn't it the wardrobe malfunction of the guy who watched beach volleyball?

174
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,328
It's strange when a person goes to watch sports

175
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,128
and anticipates swimsuits falling out of place!

176
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,228
To put it frankly, that's sexual harassment!

177
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,128
It's just a joke!

178
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:07,728
Yeah, it's just that this man's lewd.

179
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,328
He hasn't said anything strange.

180
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,628
Well, unlike the underpants of sumo wrestling,

181
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,128
swimsuits falling out of place

182
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:18,028
does not seem to be considered a violation, so...

183
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:21,128
So, you mean that the person

184
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,928
who went to watch sumo wrestling is the culprit?

185
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:26,628
No, I didn't say anything about sumo underpants.

186
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,828
Goal!

187
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,028
Higo of Big Osaka,

188
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,828
despite the pressure of being the away team,

189
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,028
made a perfect goal shot!

190
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,628
Away?

191
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,228
Hold it.

192
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,328
In soccer, when a team plays on the grounds of its opponent team,

193
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:42,228
they aren't called visitor but rather, the away team.

194
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,328
Right, right.

195
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,928
The fans are called supporters

196
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,028
and the grounds are called pitch, right?

197
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,828
Which means...

198
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:51,828
Right.

199
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:53,928
He didn't use any of the words

200
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:58,228
that people who love soccer would use

201
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:01,228
and yet he said that he liked soccer and went to watch the match.

202
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:04,728
He had to lie and say so to the police.

203
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:08,328
Mr. Kyuna...

204
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,028
Is the only one who could be the culprit!

205
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:16,727
Wrong!

206
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,927
I just recently became a soccer fan!

207
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,327
So I'm still not used to...

208
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,627
If you saw the game,

209
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,927
give me the number that was on the back of the uniform that Higo,

210
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,627
the one who made goal was wearing.

211
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:30,927
Well...

212
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,027
You wouldn't know

213
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,427
because checking the result of the game on the cell phone

214
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:39,127
will tell you who scored at what time, but...

215
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:42,527
the number on the back of the top of uniform is not announced.

216
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:46,827
Well, player Higo is a representative player of Big Osaka,

217
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:51,127
so almost all the supporters are wearing his uniform.

218
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,027
If you went to watch the match,

219
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:56,327
you'd remember the number even if you didn't want to.

220
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:57,527
Like I said,

221
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,327
I went for the first time today to watch a soccer match.

222
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,427
You're a baseball fan, aren't you?

223
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,827
The terms visitor, fan and ground

224
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:08,427
are all used when referring to baseball.

225
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,827
Weren't you actually watching a baseball game?

226
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:15,127
Why baseball?

227
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,427
Didn't you just say that

228
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:21,527
if Mr. Kunimatsu excitedly called his friend,

229
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:24,927
he would've had to have watched a super entertaining game.

230
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:27,727
If the crime was not planned,

231
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,227
and the culprit held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu

232
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,027
when they came into contact with each other...

233
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,927
It would most likely be the place

234
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,827
where the game that Mr. Kunimatsu got all excited about was held.

235
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,827
If so,

236
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,627
the culprit would have had to be at the same match too.

237
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:48,027
The score that Mr. Kunimatsu could see was 1 to 6.

238
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:49,827
And the team that kept on making errors

239
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,727
finally struck a homerun at the end,

240
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,427
scoring one more point, right?

241
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:56,727
That's far from being a great game!

242
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,527
True.

243
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,527
In any sports,

244
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,727
any game that is full of errors doesn't make any one feel good,

245
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,527
whether you're on the winning side or not.

246
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:07,427
Moreover, if the score of the game is 1-10...

247
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:08,627
No matter how you look at it,

248
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:12,227
it couldn't have been called a great game.

249
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,227
But, what if you're the only one

250
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,127
who got a souvenir from that game?

251
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,727
Souvenir?

252
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:20,827
Moreover,

253
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,727
if it was something that was used in the game,

254
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:27,427
and also evidence of the great performance of the player,

255
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,927
wouldn't you be super happy?

256
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:33,527
No matter if you're not a fan of that player...

257
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,727
Don't tell me that it was...

258
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,627
the homerun ball?

259
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,127
If so, the people in the stands have a chance to get it too!

260
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:44,027
Then, Mr. Kunimatsu caught that homerun ball!

261
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:46,327
Right! He caught it

262
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,527
and wanted to boast about to his friend over here.

263
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,927
But, it was taken away from him by Mr. Kyuma

264
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,827
who followed him here from the baseball ground.

265
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,727
But, how did he know

266
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:01,027
that Mr. Kunimatsu caught the homerun ball?

267
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,127
That's because of...

268
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,927
Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket!

269
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,427
The back pocket of Mr. Kunimatsu's pants

270
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,727
were filled with his wallet, cell phone and cigarettes.

271
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,227
It was bulging to the max

272
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,927
because the culprit shoved all of Mr. Kunimatsu's things inside.

273
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:20,227
He did this to camouflage Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket

274
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,327
that was stretched out of shape.

275
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,627
I see!

276
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:26,727
Mr. Kunimatsu had shoved the ball

277
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,427
into the pocket of his slacks.

278
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,727
If even after the ball is removed,

279
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,127
if the pocket is stretched out of shape,

280
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:37,027
it'll be obvious that something was inside, right?

281
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,027
I'm sure that he was afraid

282
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:41,827
that people would realize that a baseball was inside

283
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,127
from the shape of how it was stretched out.

284
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:48,327
But, I wonder why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend out here?

285
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,827
Right.

286
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,527
If he caught the homerun ball,

287
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,527
all he had to do was take it home and show it to him.

288
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,327
It seems that Mr. Kunimatsu was staying over at his friend's besides.

289
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:01,527
So,

290
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,027
if I told you that the baseball that I'm holding

291
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:08,527
is the winning ball that was used in the WBC game that Japan won,

292
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,527
would you believe me?

293
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,727
Of course, not!

294
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:15,227
Most naturally.

295
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:20,027
But, if there's an image that will prove that then, what?

296
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,227
An image?

297
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:22,327
Come to think of it,

298
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:26,327
you can watch homerun balls make it into the stands on TV, right?

299
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,327
Right.

300
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,927
In all other sports,

301
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,727
customers who are taken by TV cameras

302
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:32,427
are probably shot coincidentally,

303
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:33,627
but if somebody catches a homerun ball,

304
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:36,227
it is definitely aired on TV.

305
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,327
If a man wearing a cast on his arm,

306
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:38,927
obviously jumps up for joy,

307
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,927
they could've zoomed his face up.

308
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:45,127
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu told his friend to come here.

309
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,827
Now for today's homerun.

310
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,127
So that he could show his friend

311
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,327
as well as the other customers in the shop

312
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,827
the sports news that is aired

313
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,427
and then show them the homerun ball that he caught.

314
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,427
Really! Mr. Kunimatsu caught the ball!

315
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:08,127
Isn't the man sitting diagonally behind Mr. Kunimatsu...

316
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:09,927
Mr. Kyuma?

317
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,127
Yeah!

318
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,827
I see.

319
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:18,027
That's why just a while ago when the news

320
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,527
for this professional baseball game came on,

321
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,427
you shouted, right?

322
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:26,227
Because you wanted to divert our attention from the scene.

323
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,927
That's not all, is it?

324
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,327
It's also because the employee

325
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,427
was about to take this away, right?

326
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,027
The homerun ball that you stole from Mr. Kunimatsu

327
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:43,327
and buried into this barrel of popcorn.

328
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,427
But, why did you steal it?

329
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,527
Were you a fan of the player who hit that ball?

330
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,927
Yeah, I really into him.

331
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:56,427
I'm referring to my girlfriend

332
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:58,427
who died of an illness last night.

333
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,127
She used to always talk about

334
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,627
catching the homerun ball that was thrown by him.

335
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,827
She kept mumbling, so until right before she passed away...

336
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,927
That's why I planned to catch the ball

337
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:16,927
and put it in her coffin before she is cremated.

338
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:20,527
So, I sat at outfield with a glove.

339
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,327
Then, it really came flying and I caught the ball!

340
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,827
You caught the ball?

341
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,027
But Mr. Kunimatsu was the one who caught it!

342
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,027
I really caught it!

343
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:33,327
But right afterwards,

344
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,227
I was squashed by the people around me

345
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:37,127
and when I snapped back to myself,

346
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,627
the ball was at the feet of the man with a cast on his arm,

347
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,627
and he got hold of it.

348
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,127
But there's nothing you can do about it.

349
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,727
Is that why you held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu,

350
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,227
hit him and stole the ball?

351
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:52,427
No, I told him my situation

352
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:57,527
and asked him to give it to me repeatedly.

353
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,727
But he...

354
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,727
What? You again?

355
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,427
Lay off!

356
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:06,827
Please!

357
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:10,227
Please give me that homerun ball!

358
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:13,427
I don't know if you want to give to your girlfriend or what.

359
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,627
Why should I give you this ball, stupid?

360
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:20,027
I blew my top at hearing his remark

361
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:24,027
and thought that I had no choice but to take it from him.

362
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,927
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:34,627
Please tell the one you beat up those words.

364
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:38,227
We just got word from the hospital

365
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:41,227
that Mr. Kunimatsu regained consciousness.

366
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,527
-Really? -I'm glad!

367
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,327
"Haido Central Hospital"

368
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,027
For his girlfriend who died of an illness?

369
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:56,127
So, that's why he was pleading with all his might

370
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,827
for me to give him the ball?

371
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,627
You didn't know?

372
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,927
He said he explained his situation to you though.

373
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,027
I got annoyed at his words when he said he was going to

374
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,827
give it to his girlfriend as a gift.

375
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:09,827
I seemed to have skipped the part

376
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:12,627
where he mentioned that she died of an illness.

377
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:14,327
How come?

378
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:20,227
Because I just happened to be brushed off

379
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,427
by a girl that I really liked!

380
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:29,827
And about the lucky charm that was mistakenly given to you...

381
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:32,827
I got it back from the forensic officer

382
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:35,127
and handed it over to Heiji.

383
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:38,227
What? When and where?

384
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:41,527
A while ago in the corridor of this hospital.

385
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,627
-Idiot! -Idiot?

386
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:47,327
Hey, could it be that

387
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,427
the girl who brushed you off is...

388
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:52,427
Kazuha, Mr. Kunimatsu?

389
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,027
No, it can't be.

390
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:00,227
Because he went all the way back to Osaka

391
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:01,727
just so that he could have Kazuha make him a lucky charm

392
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:04,927
in order for him to win the tennis tournament

393
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,827
and yet after coming back to Tokyo,

394
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,827
he got hurt during practice.

395
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:11,827
That goes to show that you lost the will to play.

396
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:15,027
You looked inside lucky charm, didn't you?

397
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:17,727
Yeah,

398
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:21,327
the picture of that tanned boy.

399
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:24,427
Did you know about the picture, Conan?

400
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,527
Yeah.

401
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:29,127
I heard you and Kazuha talking.

402
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,827
I opened it thinking

403
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:34,227
that the cloth of the lucky charm was pretty worn out

404
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,727
for it to be brand new,

405
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:41,927
but that boy said that it was on the handle of Kazuha's bag, so...

406
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:47,427
Just thinking that this was Kazuha's lucky charm made me cry.

407
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:49,227
I was thinking of telling her how I feel about her

408
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,027
if I won the tennis tournament, but...

409
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:55,927
After catching that homerun ball,

410
00:20:55,927 --> 00:21:00,827
I thought that luck was starting to turn my way,

411
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,327
but I guess it was just my imagination.

412
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:07,527
Where is that ball right now?

413
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:10,327
The forensic officers have it for now.

414
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:15,027
Then, can you give it to the guy who struck me later?

415
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:17,327
And tell him that I'm sorry I was mean to him.

416
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:18,827
Yeah.

417
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,127
That's right!

418
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,927
Please tell Kazuha too.

419
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:25,127
What... what do you want me tell her?

420
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,627
That I'm sorry I was mean to her.

421
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,727
Mean?

422
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:58,427
Please. No matter what you do, don't look inside, okay?

423
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:01,627
Heiji!

424
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:04,927
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

425
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,227
Shoots! He's opening the lucky charm after all!

426
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:11,327
Kazuha.

427
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:15,527
Now I know why you've been going around desperately

428
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,227
looking for the lucky charm.

429
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:29,727
You were so much into...

430
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:33,527
despising me to no return like this!

431
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:37,327
What?

432
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,927
What is this?

433
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,027
Well, I'm mature and adult enough

434
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:46,727
that I won't get angry at something like this.

435
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,627
I see.

436
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:52,327
He was so vexed that he scribbled all over the picture.

It's a fashion called Gos Lolita, Gos Lolita!
