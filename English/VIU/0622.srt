1
00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:03,398
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:05,798
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,298
A sound echoes from a vacant building.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,798
The rhythmic pattern is the signal of a crime.

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,398
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,398
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:15,498
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:32,098
"Emergency 252 (Part 1)"

9
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,154
Are serious, Conan?

10
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:10,854
You found the culprit at the Wimbledon Center and nabbed him?

11
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:11,854
Sort of...

12
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:13,754
What kind of case was it?

13
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:14,754
Yeah...

14
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:17,354
he was a vicious culprit who caused fear throughout London.

15
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,754
He blew up two hospitals!

16
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:31,554
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

17
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,254
Nice centering to right in front of the goal!

18
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:43,854
My God...

19
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,854
You're really something!

20
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,254
I'll bet it made the news.

21
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,754
Not yet,

22
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,354
it seems a young boy from Japan shouted out loud

23
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:56,054
and the match was postponed it says...

24
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,954
Was that you?

25
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,654
Yeah, I did it inevitably to nab the culprit.

26
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,754
Well, I guess you can't really expose what happened, can you?

27
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:09,054
Because Conan Edogawa is a boy who can't enter Great Britain.

28
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:12,554
Yeah. Dad smoothly deceived everyone for me.

29
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,354
Oh! Kamen Yaiba!

30
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,154
Really!

31
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:21,954
This is the new figurine that is selling from today!

32
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,654
Yaiba is super awesome after all!

33
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,154
Really, it's so well made!

34
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,654
I want it, I really want it!

35
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:33,354
-There's the Laser Police over here too! -And? How was it?

36
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:34,454
I wish Ma would buy it for me...

37
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:37,954
You broke your promise with me, drank the antidote,

38
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:40,354
returned to Shinichi Kudo's body

39
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,454
and met the girl from the detective agency in London, didn't you?

40
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:48,254
Oh, yeah, thanks for the spare drug.

41
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:51,754
Don't tell me that you got carried away

42
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,754
and gave yourself away?

43
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,854
Huh?

44
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,854
No. Let me go!

45
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,354
You're such a nuisance!

46
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:06,854
Huh?

47
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,954
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

48
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,454
You've got so many extra emotions mixed up

49
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:16,454
that I wouldn't be able to make things out even if I were Holmes!

50
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,954
Especially when it comes accurately making out

51
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:22,054
what's going on inside the heart of the girl I love!

52
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:36,754
Let me tell you again,

53
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,054
that you have a body

54
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:41,354
that is capable of returning to normal only temporarily.

55
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:44,454
Under such conditions, what do you think will happen

56
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:46,854
if you give yourself away to her who's been waiting for you for so long?

57
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,654
You, yourself said so yourself sometime in the past, didn't you?

58
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,254
That she would miss you even more,

59
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:55,454
and that it would end up making her sadder.

60
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:59,054
I couldn't help it, could I? I couldn't stop it...

61
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:00,754
Don't forget, okay?

62
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:04,254
You're an existence that's prohibited from exposing yourself to the public!

63
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:08,654
You've got to stay hidden, until the time comes, understand?

64
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:11,954
What's this? Are you going to play hide-and-seek?

65
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,954
Let's play kick the can, then!

66
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:17,454
I've got the juice can that Genta just finished drinking up too.

67
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,654
Okay, then I know a good place to play!

68
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,954
Let's go...

69
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,054
Let's go!

70
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,354
See, it's this building, over here!

71
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:35,154
The other day, I came and went inside through the space between the shutter

72
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,154
and found no one inside.

73
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,154
It's amazing you found a place like this, Genta.

74
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,854
It'll be lots of fun playing kick the can here!

75
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:45,254
Yes!

76
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:50,154
If I remember correctly, this building is scheduled to come down next week.

77
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:54,154
But, how careless of them to keep the shutter open.

78
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,454
It's true!

79
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:58,554
The inside is practically all empty!

80
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,554
-See! -This is just the place!

81
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:03,654
Hey, hey, you guys!

82
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:13,754
Come on everybody who wants to play hide-and-seek whatevers...

83
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,154
Okay, hide!

84
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:19,554
Okay!

85
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,654
One,

86
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:27,854
two,

87
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,254
three,

88
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,654
four,

89
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:31,954
five,

90
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:33,554
six,

91
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:34,954
seven,

92
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,554
eight,

93
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:37,954
nine,

94
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,354
ten.

95
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,654
Geez. So, I end up being it after all.

96
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,754
Well, I did warn them to let me know right away

97
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:46,954
if they find anyone or anything suspicious,

98
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,654
so I guess I don't need to worry.

99
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:52,054
Playing once would probably satisfy them besides...

100
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,954
I guess I'll get it over with quickly then!

101
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,154
There! Found you!

102
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,354
He already found you, Ai?

103
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,954
Sorry.

104
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:06,554
Well, it can't be helped

105
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:10,954
because after all, the one who's It, has an almost devilish talent

106
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:15,454
for smoking out people who are desperately trying to hide themselves.

107
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,754
What a rude way to put it.

108
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:21,154
-I didn't mean to be. -The only one left is Genta.

109
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:23,454
It's just a matter of time.

110
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,654
The only places I didn't look are the third and fourth floors.

111
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,054
Genta is on one of those floors.

112
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,354
Hey, Conan.

113
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:33,054
It's Genta's voice.

114
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,854
Can you hear me, Conan?

115
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,054
What's up, Genta?

116
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:38,954
There's someone in this building!

117
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,054
Huh? What do you mean?

118
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,154
I heard a sound a while ago!

119
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,654
Like the wall being pounded or something.

120
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,754
Oh, there, again!

121
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,054
Hey, Genta?

122
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:56,954
There's the sound again!

123
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:58,754
Somebody is here after all!

124
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:00,554
Are you sure, Genta?

125
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:01,754
Yeah!

126
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:06,654
It sounds like somebody's pounding on the wall in the distance.

127
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,954
Do you hear that sound even now?

128
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:11,554
I don't hear it now, but...

129
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,654
First, I heard it twice, then next five times,

130
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:17,654
I heard two times again, and then it stopped.

131
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:18,754
252!

132
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,654
Someone is in need of rescue!

133
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:25,554
Isn't that the call code for the Tokyo Fire Department?

134
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:28,454
Big sis told me so the other day.

135
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:32,254
She said that if I remembered it, it may come in handy one day.

136
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:33,654
252 is the code used to notify that

137
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,854
there is someone who didn't escape in time,

138
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:37,554
or that someone is in need of rescue.

139
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:41,554
254 is a code that tells you to wait where you are.

140
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,454
If the sound that Genta heard was 252,

141
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:47,954
somebody must be calling for help.

142
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,054
No way.

143
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:53,754
At any rate, let's go to where Genta is.

144
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,154
We'll think things out after that!

145
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,554
Yes!

146
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,754
It was quiet?

147
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:19,554
You mean you heard nothing while we were coming here?

148
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:20,754
No.

149
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:24,654
I guess we'll just have to look into each room then.

150
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:27,954
Where did the sound come from?

151
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:29,854
Over that side.

152
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:34,954
Was it this sound?

153
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,754
Yeah.

154
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:40,054
But, it's not 252.

155
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,054
I guess we'll just have to check it out.

156
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:47,754
The sound's coming from the floor above.

157
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,854
It's coming from this room.

158
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,554
You guys stay back!

159
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,854
We can't be sure how things are inside.

160
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:27,354
What're you kids doing here?

161
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:30,554
No, no! You can't come into this building without permission!

162
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:33,554
What're you doing, sir?

163
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,154
We're going to be bringing this building down,

164
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,854
so we're checking on how strong the walls are by pounding on them!

165
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,854
Rhythmically, like so!

166
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:45,454
He always gets carried away and pounds in time to music.

167
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,754
Work seriously now,

168
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:52,854
because we've still got a lot of rooms to check yet.

169
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:54,054
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,354
Then, what about the 252 that Genta heard?

171
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:02,354
The rhythm of the music must've coincidentally been 252.

172
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:03,954
Gee whiz.

173
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,554
Say...

174
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:08,154
Are there only the two of you?

175
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,154
Yeah.

176
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:10,754
Right.

177
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:15,254
But aren't these the left-overs of the convenience store lunch boxes

178
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,954
you bought today for lunch?

179
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,454
There are three lunch box containers here, though?

180
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:24,054
Oh, he eats two lunches all by himself!

181
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:26,254
Yeah! I can eat for two just like that.

182
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:29,554
Hey, kids, this place is off limits, you know!

183
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,954
That's right, so get out of here quickly.

184
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,154
Okay!

185
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,854
Will do!

186
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,954
Hurry on home, and do your homework!

187
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:38,754
You can play after you're done!

188
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:39,754
Okay!

189
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:41,654
Let's go home, then!

190
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,954
Don't work too hard!

191
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:46,854
Oh, that's right,

192
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,454
may I just ask you one last question?

193
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:54,554
How much explosives are going to be used to bring this building down?

194
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,054
Beats me...

195
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,254
because we haven't finished checking yet, can't tell.

196
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,554
This building is pretty big,

197
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,954
so I guess quite a lot would be used.

198
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:07,454
I see! Then, it'll be a pretty big boom!

199
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:08,754
Yeah!

200
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:10,354
Come watch!

201
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,054
Okay, bye!

202
00:12:15,454 --> 00:12:18,054
It turned out to be nothing after all.

203
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,454
Yeah, and I was expecting it to be a criminal case or something.

204
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:24,354
Well, let's come to watch,

205
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,654
all of us together when they bring down this building!

206
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,654
Yeah, let's watch!

207
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,654
It sounds great, doesn't it?

208
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:29,954
No.

209
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:31,454
I don't think they have such a thing

210
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,054
as bringing down the building using explosives.

211
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,654
When it comes to bringing building down,

212
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,154
the usual procedure would be to lift a heavy duty machine

213
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,754
on the top of the building start destroying the building

214
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,554
from the top or the side.

215
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,654
Even more so, when it comes to destroying buildings in the city.

216
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,254
But, I've seen on TV.

217
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:50,054
When they blew up a big building...

218
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,654
There's a big bang

219
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,954
and the building comes collapsing down really nicely, right?

220
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:56,654
That's an image of what they do abroad.

221
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:59,054
In Japan, there are only a few cases

222
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,354
where they blow buildings up and destroy them.

223
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:04,854
But, the Haido Museum was brought down Doc's bomb, right?

224
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:07,154
Yes, tropical rainbow!

225
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,554
It was really pretty, wasn't it?

226
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,554
Yes!

227
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,854
It was super awesome!

228
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,054
That method was allowed on that building

229
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:23,454
because it was combined with a special event and also

230
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:29,554
because there were only dilapidated vacant buildings in the vicinity!

231
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:31,454
All Doc did was rig the bomb

232
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:37,254
so that it emitted seven colors when the bomb exploded though.

233
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:41,354
And besides, that museum was much larger than this,

234
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,954
so if it were to be brought down by something other than using explosives,

235
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:46,754
they say the cost would've been too high.

236
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:49,754
Well, in Japan where the regulations

237
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:52,154
for handling explosives are so strict,

238
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:56,254
and being that there is an occupied building right next door,

239
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,854
it's utterly unthinkable

240
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:59,554
that this building would be brought down by blowing it up.

241
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,154
The amount of explosives to be used

242
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:04,954
would have to be measured precisely while checking it over

243
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:08,554
with the blue print of the framework of the building,

244
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:10,054
it's not the kind of work you can do

245
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,854
without bringing anything but a hammer along!

246
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:15,554
Then, who were those people?

247
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,754
People who were disguised as workers

248
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:19,754
who confined somebody in this building.

249
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,054
In other words, bad guys.

250
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,754
-What? -What?

251
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,354
Confined?

252
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:28,254
Yeah, because there were three lunch boxes.

253
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:31,354
So, there's no doubt that they're hiding there's one more person here.

254
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:36,354
But, they said that the fat man ate two lunches.

255
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:40,154
There were three used wooden chopsticks left.

256
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:43,254
If one person ate up two lunches,

257
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,554
he wouldn't open another set of chopsticks, would he?

258
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:49,154
Then the sound 252 that Genta heard was?

259
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,154
Probably someone who heard our voices playing Kick the Can,

260
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:55,954
and tried to send out an SOS by pounding on the wall.

261
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:58,454
The someone who's confined...

262
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:02,054
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

263
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,954
a person who needs to be rescued.

264
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,554
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

265
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,300
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

266
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,400
a person who needs to be rescued.

267
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,000
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

268
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
But, it's unbelievable that

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,300
the two would confine somebody in here.

270
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,000
They were both wearing the same kind of clothes, weren't they?

271
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,600
Can you get something like that ready right away?

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,700
They were wearing the same overalls to begin with.

273
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,600
So, that even if someone saw them come inside,

274
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
they wouldn't be suspected.

275
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,300
That way they'd look like workers of some kind, you see!

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,300
But, if the person who is caught is sending out "252", asking for help,

277
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,700
why not shout it out?

278
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Probably because both his hands and feet are tied,

279
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,000
and his mouth is gagged.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,400
If under those circumstances,

281
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,700
the most you can do is kick something and make a sound, right?

282
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,400
Then, since that sound can't be heard anymore, don't tell me that...

283
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't worry! He's still alive!

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
If they killed the hostage,

285
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,300
they would've fled before we got to see their faces.

286
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,100
This is probably a kidnap case,

287
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,100
so it would be too risky to kill the hostage before the deal is settled.

288
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm sure they probably knocked him out and locked him in somewhere.

289
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,300
Kidnap?

290
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, don't worry yourself too much.

291
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,600
All we have to do is report this to the police, and the case is closed!

292
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,100
I guess we should call Officer Takagi who can understand things right away.

293
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Huh?

294
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,100
Conan, your cell phone standby display is

295
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,500
the man at the detective agency!

296
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

297
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,500
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

298
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

299
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,200
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later.

300
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

301
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,200
How about you, Ai?

302
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Doc's sleeping face.

303
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,600
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighborhood

304
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,100
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

305
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,600
-Oh, no! -Really!

306
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Be quiet!

307
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm going to call the police now.

308
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
Where did you say you were going to call?

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
What a brat.

310
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
He talks to us just for a short while

311
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,100
and sees through the fact that we're not real workers.

312
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah, we were on the verge of being taken in.

313
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,800
You can say that again.

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,400
We came here to talk to you in person in order to collect proof.

315
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
We've already contacted the police.

316
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,500
We already reported that somebody is confined here!

317
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,400
Right, Officer Takagi?

318
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,500
What?

319
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
Oh, come on.

320
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,200
There's no one there!

321
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,200
-Darn it! -They split!

322
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
Okay then, we'll just have to catch them one by one!

323
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, before they contact the police!

324
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,700
Hey, brat, where the heck are you?

325
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,500
Come out here you!

326
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,800
What makes you think they'll come out saying something like that?

327
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,200
If they're not there, they're in another room!

328
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,000
We better hurry, before they get us in trouble!

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Yeah.

330
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,300
When in a fix, there's no place better than behind the door.

331
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
Now, hurry!

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
Okay, I'll call the police now.

333
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Oh, no!

334
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,100
You guys go down the stairs and flee outside!

335
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,200
I'll be right behind you!

336
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay!

337
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,200
You brat! Found you!

338
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Before that...

339
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,100
First, I'll get this one!

340
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Where's the brat?

341
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,100
What was that?

342
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,000
The door's dented.

343
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,700
Hey, look.

344
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,100
The brat's passed out.

345
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,600
I don't know what's happening but we're sure in luck.

346
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,500
Let's tie him up with masking tape and lock him up some place.

347
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,900
Yeah!

348
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,800
This brat seemed to be the smartest

349
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,400
and the one we would've had a tough time with.

350
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,300
Hey! The shutter's closed!

351
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
It won't open!

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
No joke!

353
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,800
It seems that the two kept in mind

354
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
the fact that we may flee before they came to get us and prepared for it.

355
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,000
Where's Conan?

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
He said he'd be right behind us, and yet...

357
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Maybe Conan fell prey to the hands of the two men.

358
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
-What? -What?

359
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
We would inevitably have to come down

360
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
to the first floor here to get outside.

361
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
It's for sure that they'll be coming after us in a matter of time.

362
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Let's hurry and call the police then.

363
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,000
I could call them, but...

364
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
before we finish explaining what's going on,

365
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,900
they may come and take the cell phone away.

366
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Then, they'll explain to the police

367
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,100
that they were playing a police game or something and hang up.

368
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,200
In order to contact the police calmly,

369
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,500
we would have to pass them by one more time.

370
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,300
But, how?

371
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Let's crack the window and go outside!

372
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,000
Impossible.

373
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
The windows are all blocked off

374
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,700
and the glass all have steel wires in them

375
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
and we couldn't possibly crack them.

376
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,500
Then, just what do we do?

377
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,700
Well, how about this?

378
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey. Maybe we've already been reported?

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't worry!

380
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We can talk them out of whatever the kid said.

381
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,500
The bad people are here!

382
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,100
Don't dare come out everybody!

383
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,200
Does she think she's hiding or what?

384
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,100
I'll catch that brown-haired girl!

385
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
You go get the kids behind the pillar!

386
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,600
Yeah!

387
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
No, stay away!

388
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,200
Stay still!

389
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Hey!

390
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Hey! Only the school bags are here!

391
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't tell me that brat used herself and the school bags as decoys

392
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,500
and let the other brats who were hiding elsewhere get away.

393
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,100
Darn!

394
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,000
If they flee upwards, it'll be tough looking for them!

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry!

397
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,800
It's calling now...

398
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,200
Hey brats! Can you hear me?

399
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
If you dare call the police,

400
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,700
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

401
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
What?

402
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,300
Yes! 911...

403
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,500
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

404
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,300
Hello?

405
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
What on earth am I supposed to do?

406
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,800
"Next Episode" -We've got no choice!

407
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,100
Let's set this place on fire and split.

408
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,200
But, things are looking really bad.

409
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,700
In order to get out of this fix...

410
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,100
I'll ambush them by the stairs

411
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,000
so, scare them with your voice, corner them

412
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,800
and we'll sandwich them from both sides!

413
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,500
Hey brats, come out here!

414
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Next Conan, "Emergency 252 (Part 2)"
