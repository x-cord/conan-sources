1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,349
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,149
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,749
There's not much time left for The Youth Detective Squad!

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,249
Curtain call the case.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,049
But make it in time for the curtains rising on stage.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,649
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,249
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,450
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:58,245
Tamanosuke Ito's popular traveling Theatre Troupe

10
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,945
came to our town to perform a play.

11
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:04,545
"Taketori Story" -The show this time is "Taketori Story".

12
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:07,145
However, the person who plays the main character Princess Kaguya,

13
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,446
Ms. Renge Kataoka, was kidnapped.

14
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,945
Once the police starts their investigation,

15
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:17,246
I realize that this is a false kidnapping done by Ms. Renge herself.

16
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:22,846
However, Ms. Renge wasn't where she was supposedly held.

17
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:27,246
Somehow, she was really kidnapped.

18
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:31,045
The case started to move on...

19
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,246
And the curtain of the play has also gone up.

20
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:43,846
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 2)"

21
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:58,445
Once upon a time, there was an old man who harvests bamboo.

22
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,745
What's going on? The curtain is up...

23
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:04,045
There is no Princess Kaguya.

24
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,846
Is it all right?

25
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,545
Don't tell me that... Director!

26
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:15,645
You really...

27
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,845
You really are going to put her on stage!

28
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,246
We're talking about the leading role, Princess Kaguya!

29
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,945
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Her lines are really long, you know!

30
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,045
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

31
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:26,345
Don't worry.

32
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,645
I changed the script.

33
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:30,045
Everyone, hurry and memorize it!

34
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:33,045
"Mataroku Onoue (35)"

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,345
I changed it so that Megumi,

36
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:36,345
who is Kaguya as a child, has more parts,

37
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:39,545
and shortened the adult part, as well as.

38
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,745
The stage direction.

39
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:42,645
With the positioning of Kaguya and the lighting,

40
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:45,145
we will try not to show her face.

41
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,845
"Tamanosuke Ito (17)" -Except for the climax

42
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,045
where Kaguya returns to the moon,

43
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,445
we will need to show her face...

44
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:53,345
I'm telling you, it won't work...

45
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,945
Life is what the traveling theater is all about.

46
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,046
"Kikuno Ichimura (40)" -There are times when it pours.

47
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:01,845
"Hikoemon Bando (50)" -Tough times are indeed

48
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,945
when we should all come together,

49
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,045
because doing so will make for a great performance.

50
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,046
Words of wisdom by the old man,

51
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,145
I mean, the late director.

52
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:13,345
Let's have faith that Renge will return and do our best.

53
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,545
No, but...

54
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,145
Please let me try!

55
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,146
Ran...

56
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,845
Everyone is looking forward to the show.

57
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,646
Cancelling is out of the question.

58
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,346
Let me do it! Please!

59
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:27,746
Ran.

60
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,345
All right, let's do it, if you say so.

61
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:34,545
Yeah, if you say so.

62
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,145
That's true...

63
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,846
Thank you!

64
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,045
Thank you.

65
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,745
Thanks, everyone!

66
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:47,745
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke, how long into the show is the climax?

67
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,145
Well...

68
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:51,745
The whole show is approximately two hours so...

69
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:54,545
That would be just around an hour and a half.

70
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:59,845
That means that we'll have to find Ms. Renge by then, right?

71
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,345
You must have some clue, little one?

72
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:04,345
What? Yeah...

73
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,445
Right on!

74
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:08,045
-What? -Please leave it to us!

75
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,545
The Youth Detective Squad, in action!

76
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:11,845
-Yeah! -Yeah!

77
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:15,745
Hey... I never ask for help from you guys...

78
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,146
Then I'm coming with you.

79
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,545
Mr. Tamanosuke.

80
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:24,245
My part for The Emperor is about half into the play, an hour.

81
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,945
I'll look for Renge until then too.

82
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,046
Director...

83
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,146
The case is in progress too...

84
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,145
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)"

85
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:38,446
Can you hear me, officers?

86
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,046
I'm almost at the designated parking lot.

87
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,446
He received some kind of an envelope.

88
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,945
It says to switch cars to the one written on the memo.

89
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,046
The number is...

90
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,346
It's this car!

91
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,345
Officer, this is from a cell phone.

92
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,446
I'll answer it.

93
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,845
Hello?

94
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:48,345
Yes...

95
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:49,646
I understand.

96
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:53,845
I was told to go north of Takayama street.

97
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,346
I will obey their instructions.

98
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:13,845
This child possesses beauty that does not exist in this world,

99
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,445
and there are no dark places within the house she resides,

100
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,246
for it is filled with light.

101
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:27,046
It's almost time, Ms. Ran.

102
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:31,746
Calm down...

103
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:38,745
This place is where Ms. Renge was confined, right?

104
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:42,346
Well, that was actually a false alarm.

105
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:50,245
Which means whoever helped with Renge's false kidnapping

106
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,745
is the real kidnapper.

107
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,845
Is that right, little one?

108
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,745
Right, that's what I think.

109
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,646
No doubt about it.

110
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:07,446
The problem is who is that person?

111
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:11,245
But there aren't many people

112
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,746
for a young woman can easily ask to do this.

113
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,445
What's up, Conan?

114
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,246
Do you see something?

115
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:24,845
Wait a minute.

116
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:28,045
What is it? It's just a construction site?

117
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,645
Hey! Isn't that where...

118
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,445
Yeah, right! You're right!

119
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,645
What?

120
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:35,646
What's going on?

121
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,445
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:40,446
But, back then...

123
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,846
What? No, but...

124
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:56,446
Yes.

125
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:59,045
Yes.

126
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,446
I understand.

127
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:06,045
What? Inspector!

128
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,145
They got away!

129
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,146
Don't let him get away!

130
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,646
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

131
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,446
Stop!

132
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,745
Make a right turn there, Inspector!

133
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,246
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

134
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,845
Mr. Ohnuki!

135
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,845
Are... Are you okay?

136
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,046
Come on!

137
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,345
What happened?

138
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,445
I...

139
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:51,045
I was told on the cell phone to shake off the police

140
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,645
and come in here...

141
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:57,146
And when I stopped the car suddenly out of nowhere...

142
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,845
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,645
Officer Takagi, emergency deployment at the double!

144
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,345
Yes, sir!

145
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,545
And what about the hostage!

146
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:21,145
The person said, "We'll let her go as soon as her safety is confirmed."

147
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,845
"So tell them to wait until then"...

148
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:25,246
Darn it! The person is making this some kind of joke...

149
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,045
Oh, Officer Takagi?

150
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,745
There's something Pops wanted you to check out...

151
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,545
Sorry, there's no time for that!

152
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,046
What? What do you mean?

153
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:43,045
And the play kept on rolling...

154
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:47,545
Kaguya tells the Prince Ishizukuri

155
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,345
to bring the holy stone bowl of the Buddha.

156
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:55,045
To the Prince Kuramochi, she tells him to bring the jeweled sprig.

157
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,545
Finally, she tells Counselor Ohtomo no Miyuki

158
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:00,445
to bring her a colored jewel from the neck of a dragon.

159
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,245
Oh, I'm so nervous!

160
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,146
Please hurry back, Ms. Renge, Tamanosuke!

161
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:50,905
Yes, of course I wasn't looking behind me.

162
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,004
Hey, you guys can't come in here!

163
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:02,004
You're not allowed to cross the yellow line.

164
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,504
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,304
So he's still hasn't been caught at inspection point?

166
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,404
What?

167
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:12,104
No, although we set it up in less than a minute.

168
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,604
Hey! I told you not to go in there...

169
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,104
Aren't there any witnesses?

170
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:17,105
What?

171
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,704
You are...

172
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,904
Anyway, what about the witness?

173
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,504
When he was attacked?

174
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,104
What...

175
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,304
No one saw anything?

176
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,805
It was right after I got out of the car.

177
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,605
Isn't that...

178
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:56,505
Camera!

179
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,604
Thank you for your cooperation!

180
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,204
Do you see something, little one?

181
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,205
Yeah.

182
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,304
There's no doubt about it!

183
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,304
What do you mean, Conan?

184
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,704
Did you find a clue in the video?

185
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:18,204
But with the camera there the scene is out of range.

186
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,304
Yeah, but the kidnapper...

187
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,405
Hey!

188
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,304
That's hurt!

189
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,804
That's enough!

190
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,104
I'm sorry, I thought you...

191
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,804
I figured that's what was going on.

192
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,305
What? Where did he go?

193
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,404
What? Did it come?

194
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:41,504
Mr. Mouri?

195
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:42,904
Officer Takagi.

196
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,204
-Yes? -Bring everyone outside here.

197
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,004
What? Yes.

198
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,204
And...

199
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,504
There's one more thing...

200
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,605
Yes.

201
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,504
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

202
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,704
Officer Takagi.

203
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:01,705
Yes.

204
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,905
It's already on the screen.

205
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:08,004
I asked them to forward this from the investigation headquarters.

206
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:11,404
The problem is the chimney seen here on the screen.

207
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,904
The fact is this was taken down four days ago.

208
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,204
What?

209
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:20,404
This public bath was taken down to be remodeled.

210
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:25,404
In other words, this was not taken on the same day it was sent.

211
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,404
Which means...

212
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:30,004
As long as the image was set up to be forwarded,

213
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:34,004
the kidnapper could've been on the receiving end too.

214
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,604
In other words, what you're trying to say is...

215
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,904
The kidnapper was among us!

216
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:40,204
Officer Takagi.

217
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:43,704
Yes. I looked into it just like Mr. Mouri said.

218
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,404
I checked on who was always on the receiving end of the image

219
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:48,104
sent out by the kidnapper

220
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:52,105
as well as the instructions by phone.

221
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,405
Knock... Knock it out...

222
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:05,705
And take a look at the recorded image of the security camera.

223
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:13,504
Mr. Ohnuki, instructed to do so by the kidnapper,

224
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:15,804
you tried to shake off the police.

225
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,204
That's right.

226
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,404
When was that?

227
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,504
When...

228
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,804
When I was stopped at the traffic light.

229
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:26,104
I'm sure you officers heard the exchange too.

230
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,804
But, we couldn't hear the kidnapper's voice.

231
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,904
That's because it was a telephone call.

232
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,704
That telephone call, did it really come in?

233
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,204
What are you trying to say?

234
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:45,104
Then why did the kidnapper take the cell phone with the ransom?

235
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:47,604
That's...

236
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,004
What?

237
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:52,904
What? No, but...

238
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:56,004
Yes...

239
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,305
I understand.

240
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,404
This is...

241
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:04,104
As you can see, he is not using the phone.

242
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,504
If we look at the cell phone,

243
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,004
we can tell that there is no call log.

244
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,804
That's why he didn't leave it behind.

245
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:15,704
It is probably somewhere along with the ransom.

246
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:19,604
If we search the area, we will soon have the results.

247
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:24,404
But before that, we will need to rescue the hostage.

248
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,904
What's this supposed to mean?

249
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,305
The kidnapper himself should know.

250
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,904
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

251
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:36,505
Quit fooling, Ohnuki!

252
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,304
Where's my daughter!

253
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,904
Where's Renge!

254
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,604
President...

255
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,104
If something happens to my daughter,

256
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:52,304
you won't get away with this!

257
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,704
Just remember that!

258
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:57,404
No! I just helped your daughter to do

259
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,604
what she asked me to do...

260
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,905
Helped?

261
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:04,304
Right, in the beginning it was just an act.

262
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:08,704
So, Ms. Renge can definitely say who helped her out.

263
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:11,804
That is she can name the real kidnapper!

264
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:16,804
So, the kidnapper can't just release her.

265
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,804
Were you planning to kill her from the beginning?

266
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,404
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

267
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:25,304
I'm not going to talk anymore!

268
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:27,805
Please stay here, Mr. Ohnuki.

269
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:34,604
To protect the beloved Kaguya,

270
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,905
The Emperor dispatched 2000 soldiers to the Taketori house...

271
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,404
Don't worry.

272
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,704
We are definitely going to find Ms. Renge!

273
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,605
Leave it to us!

274
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,604
The Youth Detective Squad to the rescue!

275
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:55,905
-Yeah! -Yeah!

276
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,704
Brother, hurry back!

277
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:05,105
Just around here...

278
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,604
I found it!

279
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:08,605
This is it!

280
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:10,504
What is it? Weed?

281
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:14,104
It hasn't even rained, why is it so muddy?

282
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,304
Maybe it grew near water?

283
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,405
That's it!

284
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,005
You're not leaving!

285
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:31,805
Tamanosuke!

286
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,305
I'm not going to return you to the moon, Kaguya!

287
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:43,904
Come on! No way! Is he serious?

288
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:47,404
If I can be by your side, this country,

289
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,105
my parents, I'm ready to give everything up!

290
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,704
Mr. Tamanosuke's eyes...

291
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,804
They are not looking at Princess Kaguya,

292
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,504
and they are surely not looking at me.

293
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:01,704
Have faith in me. I want you to stay with me.

294
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,305
Kaguya, forever...

295
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:11,404
The possibility of the kidnapper choosing a place far from here,

296
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:14,104
knowing that it may be discovered, is low.

297
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:17,204
If so, the place of confinement should be somewhere nearby again.

298
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:18,504
And that place is probably...

299
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,404
A place that has to do with water!

300
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,305
-Okay! -Leave it to me!

301
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,104
In the light of the night,

302
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:28,404
brighter than the bright noon day,

303
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,504
comes the messenger from the moon riding

304
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,605
upon a cloud descending towards earth.

305
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,005
I found her, Conan!

306
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:05,104
Are you okay, Ms. Renge?

307
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,504
The play...

308
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,304
What happened to the play?

309
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:11,404
Hurry, Kaguya! Come here!

310
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,305
Let's go back to the moon together!

311
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,105
Ends here...

312
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,705
I can't watch anymore.

313
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,404
Ms. Renge!

314
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:32,505
Renge?

315
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:35,204
No, I can't do this.

316
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:39,004
Not after all the trouble I put you through...

317
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,105
I can't!

318
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,704
What are you talking about, Ms. Renge?

319
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,304
That won't do...

320
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,605
Neither for you nor Mr. Tamanosuke...

321
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,305
I can understand.

322
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,205
Ran...

323
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,505
Ms. Renge!

324
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,504
We will meet again.

325
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:22,404
I believe in you. Kaguya.

326
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:24,305
No, I mean Renge!

327
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:26,705
Yes.

328
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:29,005
Yes!

329
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:39,304
I hate to admit it...

330
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,805
But it's so inspiring!

331
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,004
After that, Secretary Ohnuki was arrested.

332
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:21,805
And the ransom retrieved.

333
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:27,804
Like Princess Kaguya, Ms. Renge, returns home,

334
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:30,404
and after persuading her father,

335
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:31,904
she returns to the troupe.

336

338
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:44,704

342
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,805
We wanted to see the fireworks too!

343
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,904
What is this?

344
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:12,204

347
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:21,505
Someone's been killed and we're in trouble too!

348

351
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,604
I'm the star in the next episode bringing you a Cinderella story.
