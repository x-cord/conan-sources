1
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:05,005
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,105
Codes and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,705
The seven steps of decorative Hina dolls.

4
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:11,305
The mystery of the burglar that is hidden in the red steps.

5
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:12,705
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:14,605
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,706
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,869
Look, look at that Hina doll!

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,569
How beautiful!

10
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,069
Yes.

11
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,770
Oh, so Girls' Day Festival is right around the corner.

12
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,069
I really like that Hina doll.

13
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,670
But, you've already got a nice one at home, Ayumi.

14
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,569
Hey, did you forget?

15
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,869
Last year you dropped the girl Hina doll

16
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,469
and its hands and neck broke off, right?

17
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,069
Oh, that's right!

18
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,969
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

19
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,669
But, I guess you can have it repaired.

20
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,869
Of course she did.

21
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,769
But while the craftsman was repairing the doll,

22
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,369
he got hurt and blood splattered on the face of the doll.

23
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,669
When the doll was finally repaired,

24
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,069
Peach the dog next door

25
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,369
came up to Ayumi holding the doll's neck in its jaw.

26
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,369
The paint that was used to cover the blood on the face

27
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,669
was peeled off,

28
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,670
its hair was disheveled

29
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:03,269
and it was wearing a dreadful facial expression.

30
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,969
Hey.

31
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,369
Seriously, that doll is cursed!

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,069
Yes. Ever since then, the doll set

33
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,569
was securely packed away in a box by Ayumi's father

34
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,869
who was worried that the dolls may bring upon misfortune.

35
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,969
Hey!

36
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,070
I hear that it is still way deep inside the closet...

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,670
It's not cursed.

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,869
Peach brought the doll to me wanting to show it to me as soon as possible.

39
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,570
And, the neck of the doll just happened to fall off then.

40
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,769
-Hey. -Hey, Ayumi.

41
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,870
Don't cry.

42
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,770
Just playing.

43
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,669
Peach's owner asked an acquaintance of his for me,

44
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,569
so that person is going to give me a set of Girls' Festival dolls

45
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,469
that she isn't using anymore!

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,370
It has seven rows of dolls and is larger than the one I had!

47
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,869
She says I could have the doll set if I can line them up correctly

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,069
without looking at anything for reference!

49
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,569
But you'd have to line up quite a number of dolls

50
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,869
if the set has seven rows to it.

51
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,669
Can you handle it alone?

52
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,869
I'll be just fine,

53
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,969
because I memorized how the dolls are line up over and over!

54
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,170
And besides, I'm not going to do it alone.

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,370
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 1)"

56
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,069
Hi, Ayumi!

57
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,769
So, did you memorize how the dolls are to be lined up?

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,569
You didn't look too confident when you came last time so...

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,769
Yep, no problem!

60
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,769
Okay, then I guess I'll have you line them up right now.

61
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,669
Are these all boxes with dolls in them?

62
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,669
Why do you have to memorize how the dolls

63
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,069
are supposed to be lined up, though?

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,369
Because she thinks that Ayumi's going to make a mistake.

65
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,869
The fact is, she doesn't want to give it away.

66
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,769
That's not exactly it.

67
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,569
We're just checking to see

68
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,469
if she's a girl that will take good care of the dolls.

69
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,569
Learning to line the dolls up correctly

70
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,369
will give rise to more affection towards the dolls, no?

71
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,469
After all, they are very precious dolls

72
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,770
that were bought for me.

73
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,369
I wish you luck then, little lady!

74
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Thank you!

75
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,369
There.

76
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,369
Oh, Genta, that's not right.

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,369
The man with the bow and arrow belongs more to the top!

78
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,069
Yeah, but the more the merrier!

79
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,269
No! You've got to line them up correctly.

80
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,969
And, while you're at it, that old man is the minister of the left

81
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,369
and belongs on the fourth step to the very right.

82
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,869
The young one that looks a lot like him is the minister of the right

83
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,269
and belongs on the same step to the very left,

84
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,769
so don't get them wrong!

85
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,969
The left belongs to the right and the right belongs to the left...

86
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,570
You know so much despite being a boy.

87
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,169
I helped Ran a lot when I was a kid.

88
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,769
You used to line them up when you were a kid too, didn't you?

89
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,369
Oh, didn't I tell you?

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,269
I was sent off to the States to study as early as I can remember

91
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,369
so this is the first time I'm even touching these dolls.

92
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,569
It seems my parents got my older sister Girls' Festival dolls

93
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,569
but my parents died soon after I was born too, so...

94
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,069
Besides, my sister never took the dolls out

95
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,670
because they brought back sad memories.

96
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,269
How did your parents die?

97
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,369
Well, it seems that my sister was told that

98
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,069
they died of an accident during some research they were doing.

99
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,769
Come to think of it, I remember that.

100
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,469
Pisco once mentioned that your parents were scientists.

101
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,269
Yes, although my mother was not all that well known.

102
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,269
My father, Atsushi Miyano

103
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,069
seems to have been pretty well-known in the field

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,070
as a mad scientist who was ousted from academic circles.

105
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,069
As a mad scientist?

106
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,769
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

107
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,669
You developed that drug because you took over

108
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,469
what your parents were doing, didn't you?

109
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,369
Just what kind of drug was it?

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,969
A secret drug...

111
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,969
A secret drug that's used to revive the dead.

112
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,469
Will this answer satisfy you?

113
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,869
Then, don't tell me

114
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,369
the stuff that was written in the diary was...

115
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,770
Just as I thought.

116
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,469
The thing you were looking at on the computer the other day

117
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,069
was a clue to those people, wasn't it?

118
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,769
And after you traced the clue,

119
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,669
you found out where they stopped by

120
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,569
but aside from what you expected, while you were waiting for them,

121
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,369
you overslept.

122
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,669
I guess the story went something like this.

123
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,070
Yeah, well, sort of.

124
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,570
Well, you don't have to worry.

125
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,169
The goal of my research

126
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,869
has nothing to do with making a dream-like drug like that.

127
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,369
Most of the people here on earth

128
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,369
would find no value in the stuff I'm involved in now.

129
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,569
That's right.

130
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,669
It's like the Girl's Festival dolls that are important

131
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,370
only for the girls of this small country.

132
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,069
Let's go from the top. The Emperor, the Empress.

133
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,469
Three Court Ladies, the Five Musicians,

134
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,769
the two "guardians", the Minister of the Left and Minister of the Right.

135
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,369
And on the fifth step are the Three Pages,

136
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,269
expressing the human emotions of laughter, worry and anger!

137
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,869
You've passed with flying colors!

138
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,769
Then, are you going to give me this doll set?

139
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,169
Yes! I'll have it delivered to you by courier right away!

140
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,269
-All right! -Make sure you thank grandma later, okay?

141
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,469
Okay!

142
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,669
Shall we start cleaning up, then?

143
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,069
We went out of our way to line them up,

144
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,069
and we're going to put them away already?

145
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,069
It can't be helped, because it has to be packed to send out.

146
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,169
Oh, wait! Let's all take a picture in front of it first!

147
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,370
I brought daddy's digital camera with me!

148
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,169
Okay, here goes.

149
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,970
Say cheese!

150
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,670
My, I wonder who it is.

151
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,369
Oh, Mr. Tsumagari of Room 503.

152
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,470
Hello.

153
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,569
If it's about that thing, I'm sure my husband already refused.

154
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,169
Yes, but I just can't give it up.

155
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,569
I brought an appraiser with me today,

156
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,269
and I thought I'd ask him one more time.

157
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,770
How do you do?

158
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,469
This way, please.

159
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,969
This is really something.

160
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,669
This is a fine Hina doll set.

161
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,469
A famous doll craftsman in Kyoto seems to have made it.

162
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,270
And? How much will you sell it to me for?

163
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,369
Are you buying these dolls?

164
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,169
Too late, mister!

165
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,669
They were already given to Ayumi!

166
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,769
No, I don't have a daughter so I'm not interested in dolls!

167
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,269
What I want her to sell me

168
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,669
is the hanging scroll behind all of you.

169
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,969
That's the Thunder God that was drawn

170
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,769
by an artist of the Edo era named Tetsuyama.

171
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,869
I have the Wind God which is the other half of this hanging scroll,

172
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,369
and I really want to make it a complete set.

173
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,369
But, my husband says he has no intention of selling it,

174
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,069
and besides, it doesn't look to be something so valuable.

175
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,969
Huh? Don't you know?

176
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,169
How valuable that hanging scroll is!

177
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,669
Do you have any idea how much insurance

178
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,669
your husband's late father placed on it?

179
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,569
Well, no.

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,669
20,000,000 yen! It's 20,000,000 yen!

181
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,469
That much?

182
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,769
I told your husband that I would pay him double that.

183
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,769
Besides, I feel sorry for this hanging scroll.

184
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,269
If kept in this manner, the value of this scroll will go down.

185
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,569
I think it'd be wiser to sell it

186
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,569
to a professional collector like Mr. Tsumagari.

187
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,569
But my husband...

188
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,369
We will not sell it.

189
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,069
No matter how much money you dish out for it.

190
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,069
Mother...

191
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,069
Okay, I'll be back again tonight

192
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,269
just about the time your husband comes home.

193
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,069
I'm sure he'll agree to sell it.

194
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,270
If I mention the story about him making a great loss in stocks...

195
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,469
Let's put away the dolls and hurry on home too, then.

196
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,269
How nostalgic.

197
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,969
It's already been 10 years since we last decorated them.

198
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,269
The dolls look happy that they were taken out of the box

199
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,469
after such a long time too.

200
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,170
Mother.

201
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,569
Ayumi, would it be okay to decorate these dolls here

202
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,969
until Girls' Day Festival this year?

203
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,269
I guess mother wants to say goodbye to them.

204
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,069
Sure!

205
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,169
But, can I stay here a while longer then?

206
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,169
Because I have one more picture I want to take.

207
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,969
Why don't you have mother serve you some sweet sake then?

208
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,269
I thought we were out of the ingredients to make it from scratch.

209
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,469
Oh, no.

210
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,669
I have to go out soon too.

211
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,270
I'll go buy it then! The supermarket is right there!

212
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,970
Thank you very much!

213
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,069
Ayumi, isn't it about time you tell us?

214
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,769
Just what do you want to take a picture of?

215
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,369
A picture of all of us having a good time!

216
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,169
We just took one like that a while ago!

217
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,270
Something even better.

218
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,169
Which way was it?

219
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,470
This way.

220
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,369
Okay, just a little while more to go!

221
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,769
Come on, let's go.

222
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,870
Oh, okay!

223
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,370
I think it was just around this corner.

224
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,769
Isn't that the appraiser?

225
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,769
I thought you went home.

226
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,169
Well, I forgot my cell phone.

227
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,169
I called my cell phone, then the lady answered

228
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,969
and told me that it's in the living room.

229
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,869
She told me I could get it when I go over tonight,

230
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,369
but I may get important phone calls so...

231
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,169
I decided to pick it up now.

232
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,869
But, it seems that no one's home.

233
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,570
You mean grandma isn't home?

234
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,869
Oh, he's right. Nobody's home.

235
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,370
No one is here...

236
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,569
Hey, the door's not locked!

237
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,570
Grandma, are you sleeping?

238
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,470
What is this sound?

239
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,769
I think it's the sound of the fax machine.

240
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,570
It's coming from this room.

241
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,869
What the heck is going on?

242
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,670
The room is super messed up!

243
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,769
The fax seems to be from her husband.

244
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,069
Hey.

245
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,170
That doesn't seem to be the only place.

246
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,269
Burglary. A burglar broke in after we left.

247
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,570
By the looks of it, maybe the other rooms are messed up too.

248
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,770
Ayumi!

249
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,869
I'm glad. The dolls seem okay.

250
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,769
This room looks untouched.

251
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,170
I wonder where grandma is, though.

252
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,169
It seems that grandma's not the only one who disappeared!

253
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,669
Look!

254
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,070
The hanging scroll of the Thunder God is gone too.

255
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:52,834
Let's call the police! Please call the police!

256
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:54,135
Okay!

257
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,234
Grandma?

258
00:14:57,235 --> 00:15:00,834
Oh, so I did miss you, after all.

259
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:03,234
Where were you, grandma?

260
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,234
Well, when I looked, I found out that I had also run out of sugar,

261
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,934
so I went to buy some.

262
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:12,334
By the way, why are you all looking pale-faced about?

263
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,035
Well, the thing is...

264
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,934
Setsuko, I thought you went out.

265
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:21,334
I forgot my wallet so I came back to get it.

266
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:22,534
The bedroom's...

267
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:23,734
Oh, my.

268
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:26,835
Oh, so we were just about to call the police...

269
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,034
Mr. Tsumagari!

270
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:36,234
What's up? I heard somebody scream.

271
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,334
Oh, well, the thing is...

272
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,334
A burglar, a burglar broke in!

273
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:44,935
Let's talk after the police get here.

274
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:49,034
I see, so from what I've gathered here...

275
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:53,134
Those children came here to decorate the Hina dolls,

276
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,534
and after that Mr. Tsumagari who extremely

277
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:59,134
wanted the hanging scroll that was stolen,

278
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,734
brought appraiser, Mr. Mie with him.

279
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:05,835
Officer, I don't really go for that remark.

280
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:11,434
And after the two men left, you five went out shopping.

281
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,734
Yeah, to buy the ingredients for making sweet sake!

282
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,234
Ingredients for sweet sake?

283
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:18,134
Mother was going to make sweet sake for everyone,

284
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,134
but we were out of the necessary ingredients.

285
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:24,334
Since I had to go out, I asked the children to go get it.

286
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:28,834
After that you were here alone, Grandma Yayoi?

287
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:31,434
Yes, exactly.

288
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:34,434
Did you notice anything then?

289
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:36,334
Like strange noises.

290
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:38,334
It was quiet,

291
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:42,834
until the cell phone that he forgot in the living room rang.

292
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,135
Yeah.

293
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,734
Oh, you forgot your cell phone in the living room?

294
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:50,134
We were shown into the living room first,

295
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,534
because the children were in the Japanese room.

296
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:56,434
But, we wanted to see the hanging scroll as soon as possible,

297
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,634
so forced our way immediately into the Japanese room.

298
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,034
And, after the phone call,

299
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:04,534
you seem to have gone out shopping too, but for what?

300
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:06,634
I went out to buy sugar.

301
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:11,734
I realized that we were out of sugar, so I rushed out to get some.

302
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:14,734
Do you know about what time it was?

303
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:19,834
Well, it was right after I hung up so...

304
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,134
Then, I can tell what time it was!

305
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,834
Just before I hung up, I heard the sound

306
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,234
of the fax machine on the other side of the line,

307
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,034
so if we look at the time the fax was sent,

308
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:32,134
we can find out what time it was!

309
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,034
Who was the fax from?

310
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:36,034
I think it was from my husband.

311
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,934
Then where is that original fax?

312
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:41,435
In the living room.

313
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:47,734
My God, they really went all out messing up the room.

314
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,834
So this is the fax you received from your husband.

315
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:52,134
Yes.

316
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:55,534
15:28.

317
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:57,934
What else was stolen besides the hanging scroll?

318
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:02,934
Nothing. Only here and the bedroom were ransacked.

319
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:06,434
Even the wallet that was on the shelf above the TV

320
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,734
was left untouched.

321
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:10,635
May I have a minute with you, Officer Momose?

322
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:13,434
It seems that the burglar

323
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,234
broke in from the veranda facing this window.

324
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,234
Just as I thought.

325
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,634
Why do you think that this is the way the burglar broke in?

326
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,434
We're on the 6th floor.

327
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,134
It's a common target

328
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:27,234
for burglars who use a rope to get down from the roof.

329
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:31,234
They seem to think that people living on the top floor of condos are rich,

330
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,234
and most times the windows aren't locked anyway.

331
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,734
You sure know a lot, don't you, Haibara?

332
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:40,835
Yes, because I live with an old man who likes to watch wide-shows on TV.

333
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,234
If I'm not mistaken, you're the first ones

334
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:46,834
who realized that the room was ransacked?

335
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:51,134
Yeah, when we got back from shopping, the front door was unlocked.

336
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,534
And when we heard the sound of the fax machine

337
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,734
and came into the living room, it was all messed up!

338
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,834
At that time, the clock on the fax was 15:40!

339
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:02,134
Which means that the burglary took place

340
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:06,234
between 15:30 and 15:40, a period of 10 minutes.

341
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:08,534
I wonder.

342
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,634
The burglar went down on the veranda

343
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:12,834
and came in through that window, right?

344
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,735
If it were me, I'd be too scared to come in.

345
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:20,134
See, if you close the window,

346
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:23,734
nothing is in view from the veranda because of the curtain.

347
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:26,434
If the burglar opens the window wanting to look inside,

348
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,034
the curtain would flutter in the wind,

349
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,934
and the lady on the phone would notice.

350
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:35,934
And, besides the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

351
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:39,134
Which means that the fax kept coming in

352
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,834
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

353
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:46,534
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

354
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,534
where noise is constantly coming from?

355
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,534
But, it's just the sound of the fax.

356
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:54,134
The more so frightening because it's the fax!

357
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,334
Because if the fax completes coming in and the buzzer sounds,

358
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,934
somebody in the house may come to take a look at it!

359
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,534
I see.

360
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:06,934
Beside, it's strange that the burglar didn't notice her wallet

361
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:09,134
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

362
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,834
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

363
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,634
True...

364
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:16,234
The strangest thing is,

365
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:20,234
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

366
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:23,334
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

367
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,234
You idiot, only a professional would know

368
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:29,134
if that scroll is really worth that price.

369
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:34,634
Which means that the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

370
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,134
Yeah.

371
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,734
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

372
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:41,334
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

373
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,934
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

374
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,834
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

375
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:50,534
Which means that the culprit has no definite alibi

376
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:54,834
and on top of that had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

377
00:20:54,835 --> 00:21:00,035
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

378
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:03,034
Come to think of it, you were loitering around

379
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,534
in front of this house, weren't you?

380
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:06,534
I just told you, didn't I?

381
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,934
That I came to get my cell phone, but nobody was home.

382
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,234
But, the door wasn't locked!

383
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,634
Well...

384
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:15,234
Did you lock the door when you left the house?

385
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:20,734
Well, I think I did, but I was in a rush so...

386
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:24,535
By the way, why were you at the front door a while ago, mister?

387
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:27,434
I came to check things out

388
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:30,134
because Mr. Mie didn't come back for some time.

389
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:33,534
-Were you all here? -Yes.

390
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:38,134
Then, you also knew that he forgot his cell phone, right?

391
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:44,134
Yes, since he was by me until I started talking to grandma.

392
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,034
You mean you left while he was on the phone?

393
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:49,134
I just went to buy some cigarettes!

394
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,534
In other words, just as this child just said,

395
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:54,834
you two do not have an alibi yet.

396
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:59,134
Hey, will you cut out just suspecting us?

397
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:02,034
Those two are going to get 20,000,000 yen too

398
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,135
if insurance money comes in!

399
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:09,534
I'm just saying even you two can carry out something like this!

400
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:12,835
-What a thing to say? -Stop it.

401
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:16,334
We sure are in a fix.

402
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,034
All four of you have motives, no alibi and on top of that,

403
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,734
all of you are capable of carrying out the crime.

404
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:24,635
The key to nailing down the culprit is...

405
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,135
in the Japanese room!

406
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:06,134
Hey, Conan.

407
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:08,534
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

408
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,634
Oh, sorry,

409
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,234
I'm in the process of thinking now.

410
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:15,935
But we better hurry or the steps will...

411
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,934
But the steps...

412
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:23,135
Thanks, Ayumi! I've solved the mystery!

413
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:24,734
Next Conan,

414
