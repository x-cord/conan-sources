1
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,093
Smells good.

2
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:07,093
How's this coming along?

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:11,353
It's delicious.

4
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:15,353
All that's left is to add the secret ingredient.

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,312
Let's see. Pork, potatoes.

6
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:25,033
Carrots, onions.

7
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,212
Daikon radish?

8
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:27,903
Burdock root.

9
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:32,413
Burdock root? In curry?

10
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:34,972
Like daikon radish, it's a root vegetable.

11
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:36,772
It's got good texture and tastes good, too.

12
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,543
I see.

13
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:42,923
Chicken, beef, seafood.

14
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,803
Enoki mushrooms and spinach.

15
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:52,092
And finally, plenty of love.

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,803
Sounds like it'd give you heartburn.

17
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:05,073
That's right. I'm absolutely certain.

18
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,612
I did it for Erina.

19
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:10,653
No, Shohei-san did nothing wrong.

20
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:14,652
Please calm down. Tell us what happened.

21
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:16,743
Excuse me, Inspector Megure.

22
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:20,192
Mori-kun, when did you get here?

23
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:23,342
Wherever there's a case, Mori Kogoro is there.

24
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:27,383
By the way, Inspector, what do you like to put in your curry?

25
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:31,133
Mori-kun, is this really the time to be asking that question?

26
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,262
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,592
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

28
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:40,282
A man protects his beloved wife!

29
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,273
What is the secret ingredient that changes the case?

30
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:44,232
Always determining the one truth

31
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,613
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

32
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:48,693
his name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:32,943
"The Man Who Loved Too Much!"

34
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,342
Let's review what happened.

35
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,853
This afternoon you went to the department store to buy a birthday present for Erina-san.

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:48,102
When you returned, you noticed that the window by the entrance was broken.

37
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:53,122
You quietly entered the house and looked in the living room,

38
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:56,292
where you saw the dead man ransacking the room.

39
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,653
A burglar, huh?

40
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:07,793
The man noticed you, raised his knife, and came towards Erina-san.

41
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:13,803
However, Shohei-san fought back using a golf club that was in the living room.

42
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:18,932
When the burglar fell, he hit his head on that object and died.

43
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,902
Th-That's right... It... It was me.

44
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:26,563
But Shohei-san was preoccupied with protecting me.

45
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:32,472
We identified the dead man by checking his phone.

46
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,943
Masuoka Susumu, 38 years old.

47
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:39,322
He previously committed forcible entry and theft on three occasions,

48
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:40,642
and had a criminal record.

49
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,572
So he had previous offenses, huh?

50
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,953
By the way, did that bag belong to the dead man?

51
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:52,713
Th-That jewelry is mine.

52
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:56,202
That matches their statement.

53
00:04:56,203 --> 00:05:01,343
Yeah. This is a tragedy that occurred when a husband tried to protect his beloved wife.

54
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,353
Certainly seems that way.

55
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:08,233
Make sure you're honest when you testify to the police or at the courthouse.

56
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:13,502
As long as they recognize Shohei-san's pure and noble love for Erina-san,

57
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,613
I'm sure everything will be fine.

58
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,042
And then repent for your crimes accordingly.

59
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,663
Right, Inspector?

60
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,743
Looks like you won't have to do any sleeping this time.

61
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:27,123
Thank you!

62
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,752
But there are a few other things I'd like to confirm.

63
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:31,302
Let's go, kid. We've got shopping to do.

64
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,223
Okay.

65
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,013
Tomatoes, avocados.

66
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,442
Why don't we go all the way and make goya champuru?

67
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:45,223
I don't know about champuru, but goya curry sounds pretty good.

68
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,523
Is this...

69
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,663
A birthday card?

70
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:56,273
Keep on being a beautiful lady Shohei

71
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,143
What's this doing here?

72
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,182
What are you doing? Let's go.

73
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:10,063
I'm going to use their bathroom. Hold on.

74
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,043
Jeez.

75
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:26,303
There's only one pair of shoes.

76
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:29,642
The golf bag is back here?

77
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,212
Yes, that's right.

78
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,813
Erina and I entered through this entrance.

79
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:42,363
No, he entered through the back door alone and grabbed a golf club.

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,992
Huh? Conan-kun?

81
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,862
Sorry, but I was hoping to use your bathroom.

82
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:48,952
Go ahead.

83
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,243
Thanks.

84
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,433
Hey, Erina-san.

85
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,532
What is it?

86
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,813
That shelf behind you is full of photos of you.

87
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:16,313
My husband takes pictures of me practically every day and puts them on display.

88
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:19,592
Shohei-san must really love you.

89
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:20,692
Yes.

90
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:26,003
He tells me he loves me every day and is completely devoted to me.

91
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:30,482
Even though I've never told him that I love him,

92
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,333
he loves me more than anything.

93
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,073
But it's not right.

94
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:38,003
Erina-san, are you okay?

95
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:39,463
Watch your step.

96
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:44,593
That's my precious collection.

97
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:48,092
They're all European. They're valuable and expensive.

98
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:53,723
Sorry. But it's a good thing none of your photos or teacups were broken.

99
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,192
You're right. Lucky us.

100
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:00,362
Erina-san, could I speak with you?

101
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,113
Coming!

102
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,493
The rest of the house was thoroughly ransacked,

103
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:11,413
but their valuables are undamaged.

104
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:13,483
It can't be a coincidence.

105
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,023
Just this spot...

106
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,023
That chair was knocked over, too.

107
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:32,093
Was the culprit sitting in this chair?

108
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,773
But why would a burglar sit in a chair?

109
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:39,523
Huh?

110
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:42,523
Only that section of the wall is a different color.

111
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,533
Was the calendar moved?

112
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,653
What's this doing here?

113
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:51,573
What's this dent?

114
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,583
Was this calendar moved to hide this?

115
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,613
This was no ordinary burglary.

116
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:32,903
They lied about everything.

117
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:35,123
Something must have happened.

118
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,113
What happened here?

119
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,002
I knew you were taking too long.

120
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,332
You shouldn't be wandering around back here.

121
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,813
Come on, we're leaving.

122
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,322
Mori-kun, you're still here? I thought you left.

123
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:05,102
Sorry. We'll be leaving right away.

124
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,693
Please do.

125
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,812
Yes, sir. Come on, let's go.

126
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:11,662
Let go, Mister. They've got curry.

127
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:12,613
Curry?

128
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:14,703
Hey, you're right.

129
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,202
I detect the delicious smell of curry.

130
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:21,642
That smells great. Is that tonight's dinner?

131
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:22,213
Yes.

132
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,962
We're making curry today, too.

133
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,242
You two are going to cook?

134
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:27,953
Yes.

135
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:32,723
Normally Ran handles all the cooking, so we thought we'd surprise her today.

136
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,472
We've been thinking about how we can make a tasty curry.

137
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:39,392
Do you have any secrets to making a tasty curry?

138
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:42,853
If you do, I'd appreciate it if you could tell us.

139
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:45,602
Well, uh...

140
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,462
Why don't you tell them, Erina?

141
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:47,983
What?

142
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,983
About your secret ingredient.

143
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:52,742
Secret ingredient?

144
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:56,432
My Erina's curry is always exceptionally good.

145
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,373
Not even I know what the secret ingredient is.

146
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:02,372
It's so good, I could eat it every day and never get sick of it.

147
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:03,873
Right, Erina?

148
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,872
Uh, yeah.

149
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,362
What's the secret ingredient?

150
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:11,122
Could you tell us?

151
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:15,653
Uh, the secret ingredient I put in my curry...

152
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,623
...is love.

153
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,253
I think about my beloved husband while I cook.

154
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:33,282
Hey, Erina-san. Can I try that curry?

155
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,093
No!

156
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:40,533
I-I'm sorry. I'm not confident in my cooking today.

157
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:43,682
Hey, kid. Show some restraint.

158
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:47,043
Er, sorry about that. Truly.

159
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,093
What did they burn?

160
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,673
It was probably that.

161
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:02,023
What's this?

162
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,732
Enough, kid.

163
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,373
Mister, look at this.

164
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:10,983
There's something written on this notepad.

165
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:13,492
What's this?

166
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:17,952
"I love you. I truly love you."

167
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,363
What is this?

168
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,492
I wrote that.

169
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,032
You did?

170
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,752
Yes. Go ahead and read the rest.

171
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,412
The rest?

172
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:32,383
"So let's go to Lake Yamanaka today."

173
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:37,052
I planned on taking her there as a birthday surprise.

174
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,902
But I was too embarrassed to tell her directly,

175
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:42,392
so I'd been practicing by writing it on that paper.

176
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:45,893
Lake Yamanaka is a famous tourist spot.

177
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:50,903
But, Shohei-san, don't you tell Erina-san that you love her every day?

178
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,653
I don't see why you'd need to practice.

179
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:58,632
No, Shohei-san wrote this.

180
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:02,663
Shohei-san is the only person who would write that he loves Erina-san.

181
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:08,722
No, this isn't Shohei-san's handwriting.

182
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,543
Does that mean Masuoka wrote this?

183
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:16,452
Was it Erina-san who was sitting across from Masuoka-san?

184
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,053
Not only that, but they were alone together.

185
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:20,293
I love you?

186
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:28,562
The culprit died when he hit his head on that, right?

187
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,382
So, what?

188
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:32,943
Isn't that a boat weight?

189
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,012
A boat weight?

190
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,573
Yeah, look. It says 3 kilograms on it.

191
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:42,643
Shohei-san and Erina-san, why is this in your living room?

192
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,202
Because I—

193
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:47,002
You bought it?

194
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:49,963
Ah, you must have a boat.

195
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,333
Yes, I was thinking about buying a boat.

196
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,593
These are rope fibers.

197
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:03,722
Could the culprit have brought this here?

198
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:08,103
What? The culprit brought it? Uh...

199
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:11,363
I, um...

200
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,152
Shohei-san, I'm sorry,

201
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:22,422
but could you and Erina-san come down to the station and tell us more about the case?

202
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,542
Honey, you need to take your medicine first.

203
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:26,213
My medicine?

204
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,623
That's right. You need to take it right away.

205
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:33,342
He has a chronic disease. His medicine is in the bedroom.

206
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,703
Come on, quickly.

207
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:44,763
You nearly told them the truth, didn't you?

208
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:47,142
No, I just...

209
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,642
Keep it together.

210
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:52,273
Sorry. I'll be careful.

211
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:59,052
It's true. I'd do anything for you, Erina.

212
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,403
I love you. I love you, okay?

213
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,913
I hate this about you.

214
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:09,783
I wish you'd disappear and leave me alone.

215
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,293
That's why I asked him to do that.

216
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,933
Asked him to do that? Disappear?

217
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:18,173
Crap!

218
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,103
Ow!

219
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,712
There you are. We're getting out of here.

220
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,803
We're going shopping.

221
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,722
Inspector, sorry for staying so long.

222
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:31,342
Hey, you brat! You'd better wait for me in the entryway.

223
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:35,193
Excuse us. We should get going.

224
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,263
Take care.

225
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,463
Thank you. Excuse us.

226
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,133
We're leaving!

227
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,733
Leaving...

228
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:51,803
Leaving...

229
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,272
A-Are you all right?

230
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:56,833
What is it, Mori-kun?

231
00:15:57,213 --> 00:16:00,463
We'll be leaving after I solve this case.

232
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:01,992
What did you say?

233
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:04,632
It's already clear what happened.

234
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,472
Shohei-san acted in self-defense while protecting Erina-san.

235
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,783
Self-defense.

236
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:13,342
It certainly looks that way.

237
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:18,652
But Shohei-san and Erina-san lied about the entire case.

238
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,983
The two of them are fooling us.

239
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,542
They lied?

240
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:27,493
They're fooling us? What are you talking about?

241
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,493
I found something.

242
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,862
On my way here,

243
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:34,993
I found a birthday card for Erina-san by the entryway,

244
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:39,753
as well as Shohei-san's footprints leading to the back door.

245
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:45,633
Shohei-san, you left alone and returned alone through the back door.

246
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:49,633
You've got mud from around the back door on the hem of your pants.

247
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:57,023
Alone? Where was Erina-san then?

248
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:00,153
She was meeting with Masuoka inside this house.

249
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,323
With Masuoka? Hold on, why would she be meeting him?

250
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:08,323
Because Masuoka wasn't a burglar.

251
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:10,323
What? Who was he, then?

252
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:11,903
Just listen.

253
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:17,333
Masuoka probably told Erina-san to invite Shohei-san on a trip.

254
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,012
At their destination, he'd kill him using a knife,

255
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,513
use ropes to tie a weight to him, and submerge him in the lake.

256
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,822
But Erina-san had a problem.

257
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:30,093
She didn't know how to invite Shohei-san on a trip.

258
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,922
After all, she'd never told him she loved him.

259
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:36,603
I've never told him that I love him.

260
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:41,063
Masuoka had Erina-san practice by writing a note.

261
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:43,613
That was the note we found.

262
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,613
"I love you. I truly love you."

263
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:50,082
That's when tragedy struck.

264
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,613
Shohei-san came home.

265
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,123
He mistook their meeting for an affair.

266
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,133
An affair?

267
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,623
I-It was a misunderstanding?

268
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:04,292
That's it.

269
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,543
Pour your heart into your writing.

270
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:08,682
Pour my heart into it...

271
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:12,433
That's right, ma'am. "I love you."

272
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,453
Okay.

273
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:16,803
"I love you."

274
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:23,803
Erina loves that man?

275
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:44,082
Then Shohei-san's rage was directed towards Erina-san.

276
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,202
You were cheating on me with this guy, Erina?

277
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:49,752
But I love you so much.

278
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,772
This can't be true, Erina.

279
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:55,933
You're married to me, but you've been seeing that guy?!

280
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:04,592
There's a dent hidden beneath the calendar behind me.

281
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,562
You can check it later.

282
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,443
Mori-kun, hold on. I don't understand.

283
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,792
Invite? Kill? Submerge?

284
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,712
What are you talking about?

285
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,453
What did Erina-san ask Masuoka to do?

286
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:20,552
While looking for Conan,

287
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:23,713
I happened to overhear them speaking in the bedroom.

288
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:27,583
I wish you'd disappear and leave me alone.

289
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:30,093
That's why I asked him to do that.

290
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,593
"Asked him to do that"?

291
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,593
"I wish you'd disappear"?

292
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:41,102
Erina-san asked Masuoka to kill Shohei-san.

293
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:43,122
Kill Shohei-san?

294
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,023
Sh-She put a hit on him?

295
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:48,652
N-No! I didn't do it.

296
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,283
Detective Takagi, could you check inside the curry?

297
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:56,153
What's this?

298
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:03,813
Erina-san, is this the secret ingredient you included for Shohei-san?

299
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:10,152
Erina-san intended to use that money to pay Masuoka for Shohei-san's murder.

300
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:13,423
She invited Masuoka here while Shohei-san was out.

301
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,173
Y-You're wrong.

302
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:20,183
There's blood on those bills. It's probably Masuoka's.

303
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:24,563
And if thoroughly examined, Erina-san's fingerprints may turn up, too.

304
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,442
After Masuoka was killed,

305
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:33,452
there was still a mountain of evidence left of the hit on Shohei-san.

306
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,763
Erina-san couldn't fool Shohei-san.

307
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:41,573
So she convinced him to lie instead.

308
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,932
I'm sorry, Erina.

309
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,563
What should I do?

310
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:52,352
If the police find out that I tried to have you killed, I'll be ruined.

311
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,593
Erina, what should I do?

312
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,072
Fool them.

313
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:58,723
What?

314
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:02,603
If you love me more than anyone,

315
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:07,783
Lie for me.

316
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,602
It's not my fault.

317
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,733
That's right! It's not her fault!

318
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,622
It's all my fault.

319
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:22,723
It's my fault that I couldn't become Erina's ideal husband.

320
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:25,742
Because I couldn't die for her.

321
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:30,123
Because I couldn't keep her secret.

322
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,693
It's not Erina's fault.

323
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,593
Right, Erina?

324
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,993
My Erina?

325
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,143
You creep.

326
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:16,132
This tastes really good.

327
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,192
You're not such a bad cook when you try.

328
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:21,073
Right? The word impossible is not in my dictionary.

329
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:24,922
The final secret ingredient is a pinch of salt.

330
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,062
It's salty now.

331
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:27,592
What? Then we'll add some sugar cubes.

332
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:28,563
Now it's too sweet.

333
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:29,612
Ponzu, then.

334
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,082
How about yakiniku sauce?

335
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,532
No, this calls for wasabi.

336
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,072
How about red peppers?

337
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,083
And finally, you've got to add an egg.

338
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:40,412
Hello, Ran-neechan?

339
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,943
Sorry, but could you pick something up on your way home?

340
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:44,553
Bring us something!

341
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:52,393
The victim was shot while sleeping on the sofa.

342
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:55,033
He was shot with that shotgun, right?

343
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,343
It's a bloodstain.

344
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:59,932
This must've splattered here when he was shot.

345
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:04,803
But since there's no blood on the curtains, that means they were open then, right?

346
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:09,073
You're saying one of us killed him?

347
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:13,503
