1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:03,847
What did you just say?

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:06,347
Tamanosuke was arrested?

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:07,448
Yes.

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,247
Conan, please save my brother...

5
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:11,447
Calm down, Megumi!

6
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,347
What on earth is going on?

7
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:16,047
He's being charged for killing Mr. Nabeshima

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:17,848
who is in charge of stage settings.

9
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:24,547
Tamanosuke would never do a thing like that!

10
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,647
But, they say he was found lying on the ground

11
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:28,947
holding a knife, right beside Mr. Nabeshima.

12
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:31,347
You mean he was passed out?

13
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:34,047
Moreover, he seems to have been wearing

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,847
a blood smeared mask of the phantom.

15
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:38,147
So, they say that this phantom fuss up to now

16
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:40,047
was all the doings of the leader.

17
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,947
No way. Dad, let's go to the police station now.

18
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:44,748
Okay.

19
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,847
"Interrogation Room 1" -You were called out by a letter?

20
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,048
Yes.

21
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:56,647
"Be gone!"

22
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:00,047
"I want to put flowers to the small dying village."

23
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:02,747
"Stone monument's morning, at the base I will wait."

24
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:04,047
"Rausu."

25
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:05,547
This is also a code where the "sa" in the sentences

26
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,347
must be removed to read, right?

27
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:08,947
Just like the other blackmails

28
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:11,247
received from the phantom of the Konpira or what-nots.

29
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:12,547
That's right.

30
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:15,748
And if you redo it to make a normal sentence...

31
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:19,947
"I want to talk to you about Renge".

32
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:23,447
"I'll be waiting for you at the open lot by the monument".

33
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,948
And, when you got to the site...

34
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,547
Exactly!

35
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:40,447
But why would somebody do something like that?

36
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:44,748
That's because that person is indeed the phantom of the Konpira.

37
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:47,147
He's the one who sent letters

38
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,847
demanding that the heroine be changed,

39
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:51,547
dropped the big lantern on top of Romi

40
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,347
and switched her mouthwash to something else.

41
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:55,647
That's the only thing thinkable!

42
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:00,047
About that, Mr. Rausu was saying the same thing.

43
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:02,047
He said though, that he was called by you.

44
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,347
What?

45
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:07,547
No, no, I'm not saying that Tamanosuke is the phantom.

46
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:10,947
But, it's true that he asked me to come meet him.

47
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,247
So, this is the letter.

48
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:16,547
Tamanosuke says that he received a letter exactly like this.

49
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,847
However, "park" had been changed to "monument"

50
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,047
and your name is written as the sender.

51
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,747
And did you go there?

52
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:27,247
I did, but Tamanosuke didn't come.

53
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,747
Most naturally,

54
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,847
because at that time he was at the scene of the crime.

55
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:36,047
Then, did you meet or see anyone at the park?

56
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,548
Yeah, I did.

57
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:45,347
Romi?

58
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,347
So, although you didn't notice that Mr. Rausu was there,

59
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,947
you were in the vacant lot of the park.

60
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,448
What did you go there for?

61
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:57,548
"I was practicing my voice in secret."

62
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,047
I see.

63
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,347
I'm honored

64
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,447
to be able to conduct investigation together with you, Mr. Mouri.

65
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:08,847
The evidence that you have deeming Tamanosuke Ito to be the suspect

66
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:12,347
is the murder weapon knife that he was holding, was it?

67
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,348
Yes!

68
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,847
But Tamanosuke was passed out, wasn't he?

69
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:20,547
It could be that someone else made him hold the knife, right?

70
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,548
That's right.

71
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,747
I'm sure that's what happened.

72
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:24,847
And, what do you have to say about that?

73
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,847
He did have a wound on the back of his head.

74
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,647
But it could be that he fought with the victim but slipped,

75
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:34,747
and hit his head on the corner of the pedestal or something.

76
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,848
Corner of the pedestal?

77
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,447
Please explain.

78
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:40,647
All right.

79
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:44,547
Behind the victim that was lying on the ground, is a memorial monument

80
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,548
and there is a pedestal.

81
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,847
And what is his motive for killing the man?

82
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:52,747
Most likely, money problems.

83
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:55,447
It seems that the victim used to demand advance payments

84
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:57,147
and other things quite impossible to do,

85
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:00,247
being that he was a staff member from the time of the former leader.

86
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:02,247
Therefore, Tamanosuke finally...

87
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,248
That can't be...

88
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:04,248
You're not serious, are you?

89
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:07,547
Another thing! The most serious point is...

90
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,847
that he tried to frame Mr. Rausu up as the phantom of the Konpira,

91
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:15,347
place the blame on him and win Renge's heart over.

92
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:18,747
That just can't be because those two are already...

93
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,047
In love with each other to begin with.

94
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,847
Although it's vexing to think so.

95
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,047
So, he wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.

96
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:29,147
That's why! It's all probably because Mr. Rausu appeared.

97
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,447
You can never tell what goes on between a man and a woman

98
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:33,347
just by looking on the outside, you see.

99
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:34,948
No.

100
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,247
I guess they won't be showing the play today.

101
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:40,247
Not with the leader taken to the police as a suspect.

102
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:44,148
How disappointing. Renge Kataoka's acting was pretty good.

103
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,647
You believe Tamanosuke, don't you?

104
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,147
And I know he believes in me too.

105
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,447
That's why he let me substitute for Romi.

106
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,647
You were fantastic.

107
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:01,047
But, I was scared.

108
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,047
I was so sure I couldn't do it.

109
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:06,047
But the angel of music,

110
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,847
the phantom encouraged me.

111
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,047
What?

112
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,347
You're not the one, are you?

113
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,247
You're not suspecting me, are you?

114
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:18,148
I don't know what or who I should believe.

115
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:20,147
If you're going through so much suffering,

116
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,547
drop this acting bit all together!

117
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,948
Renge, I want you to spend your life together with me.

118
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,547
Is he serious?

119
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,547
I'm sorry. I'm worried about the troupe leader right now

120
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,647
and can't think of anything else...

121
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:37,148
Okay, then please relay this to the leader.

122
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,347
The damage I have incurred as a sponsor is great.

123
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,747
I hate to say this, but if things go on as is,

124
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,147
I have no choice but to pull out.

125
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,347
Oh no!

126
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:47,347
However, when it comes to you, it's a different story.

127
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,148
I will not give up, no matter what.

128
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:53,847
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:56,347
I didn't mean to eavesdrop but...

130
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:58,147
Hey, hey, is it true

131
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:00,547
that you were encouraged by the phantom?

132
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:03,147
But, I couldn't jump up for joy.

133
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:06,247
When I heard the applause, I kind of got carried away for an instant...

134
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,647
Don't worry, you've got talent!

135
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:12,547
But the new heroine being encouraged by the phantom,

136
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:15,647
that's how it goes in the Phantom of the Opera too.

137
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:18,147
Yes, that scares me too.

138
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:20,247
I wonder who on earth it is.

139
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:23,747
If it's not Tamanosuke, could it be Mr. Rausu after all?

140
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,847
Or, could it really be the phantom?

141
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:28,447
A ghost or a monster?

142
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,048
No, that's impossible.

143
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:40,848
Here it is!

144
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,848
What is it, Conan?

145
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:46,548
What's that?

146
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,647
A speaker?

147
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:51,648
Yes, a wireless. It probably goes from here to...

148
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:56,247
In fact, I heard the voice of the phantom that day too.

149
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,847
Really, Conan?

150
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:00,347
Which means, in other words...

151
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:04,747
The phantom of the Konpira is neither a ghost nor a monster.

152
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,047
I'll go ask dad one more time!

153
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,448
I'm going with you!

154
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,248
I've got to rush too!

155
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,947
There's something that's been bothering me from the beginning.

156
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:19,447
The letters that are read by removing the letter "sa" and the blackmails.

157
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,347
The phantom of the Konpira moving around

158
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,947
just like the phantom in the Phantom of the Opera.

159
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:26,647
Everything that is happening seems to be unscrupulous

160
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:30,047
and deliberately attract the attention of others.

161
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,347
But the killing itself gives me a totally different impression.

162
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,548
That could be a clue to something.

163
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,547
So, this is the corner of the pedestal.

164
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,648
It's a great place for the killer to hide.

165
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,547
Dad! Please do something!

166
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,247
We've come this far...

167
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:11,347
At this rate, Tamanosuke's stage will be forever gone!

168
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:14,147
Don't worry about that!

169
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:17,447
I just got word from Officer Ohnishi a while ago.

170
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,847
Tamanosuke Ito has been acquitted.

171
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,547
But, on the other hand, Tatsuhiko Rausu

172
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:25,047
is being interrogated as a prime suspect.

173
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,048
I'm sure that they're on the right track this time.

174
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:31,147
At the scene of the crime, the fingerprints of the victim

175
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:33,347
as well as that of Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu were detected

176
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,747
on the cane used to climb up the stone steps.

177
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,347
They say that the fingerprints probably rubbed off

178
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:40,047
when he struggled with the victim.

179
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,448
Moreover, in his car, they found...

180
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:50,547
You gotta be kidding. I don't know of that cane!

181
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,447
I don't remember putting something like that inside the trunk!

182
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,447
It seems that the phantom in question appeared at the showing yesterday

183
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,747
and that there was somewhat of a commotion.

184
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,748
Although it seemed as if most of the audience

185
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,047
thought it was just a part of the show.

186
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:05,148
Isn't it then that you used the projector?

187
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,447
I see! So, that's how it was done...

188
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,647
You gotta be kidding!

189
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,547
Are you saying that I did that?

190
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:20,547
If you use a remote controller, you could've operated the projector

191
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:23,447
even from the audience where you were seated.

192
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:24,448
Absurd.

193
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,147
And for the tape recorder and transmitter.

194
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:32,547
Was it Renge? You used these to make her hear the voice of the phantom.

195
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:35,847
And from the room backstage we confiscated the speaker.

196
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:38,847
You did all this to grasp her heart.

197
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:41,447
You wanted to set Tamanosuke up so that you could make her yours.

198
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,047
Isn't that right?

199
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,248
You gotta be joking!

200
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:49,347
Brother! Brother!

201
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,547
Sorry to have worried you.

202
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,847
Where's everybody?

203
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:53,147
They're at the hotel.

204
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:56,647
Let's go, we've got to decide what we're going to do about today's show.

205
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,747
Yep.

206
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,848
Conan, thank you.

207
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:03,847
The problem is the pedestal.

208
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:07,548
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from up there...

209
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,611
That's right!

210
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,111
An alibi. I've got an alibi!

211
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,811
Too bad, but that also...

212
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:23,611
So you lied about practicing your voice at the vacant lot of the park?

213
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:26,611
"I was afraid that they would take my role away from me".

214
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:32,711
"I thought that maybe if I testified in Mr. Rausu's favor..."

215
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,911
So, that's what she said.

216
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,312
What?

217
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,411
Why would she say something like that?

218
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:41,211
Huh, what's the matter?

219
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:44,311
I'm sorry, may I go to the restroom?

220
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,811
One more thing. The projector used to project the phantom.

221
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,611
If it's possible to move it using a remote controller from the audience,

222
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:51,811
the same could be done from elsewhere.

223
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,712
That's right! Like from above the stage!

224
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,411
Officer.

225
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,911
You're Mr. Mouri's...

226
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,411
Pops Mouri told me to ask you.

227
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,611
Mr. Mouri has a question?

228
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:07,711
Where were Mr. Rausu's fingerprints on the cane?

229
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:10,211
On the tape.

230
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,212
Tape?

231
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,911
Right, although the color and the way the tape

232
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:14,611
is wrapped around the cane differs depending on the shop.

233
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:16,211
Well, it's sort of like a guide.

234
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,011
Which shop did that cane belong to?

235
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:22,211
As to that, we haven't found a shop that carries that cane yet.

236
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,411
We thought we'd find it right away

237
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:27,211
because it's unusual to wrap the cane with luminous tape.

238
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:28,812
Luminous tape!

239
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:36,711
I got it! I know who's the real killer!

240
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:39,111
Tatsuhiko Rausu has fled!

241
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,511
What?

242
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:43,211
I'm sorry, it was just for a split second when I was off my guard.

243
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,212
After him right this minute, on the double!

244
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:00,111
You don't love me! You don't love me! You don't love me!

245
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:02,311
Let me go! Let me go!

246
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:06,111
But, you are destined to be with me forever.

247
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:07,912
You can never part from me!

248
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,611
The unscrupulousness is the same.

249
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,411
Why would the culprit go out of the way to let their whereabouts be known?

250
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,111
I've no choice but to go!

251
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,711
Conan!

252
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,311
Have you seen Renge?

253
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:33,811
Tamanosuke.

254
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,111
This is...

255
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,711
Don't tell me that Rausu got her...

256
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:40,311
There he is! I looked all over for you, Conan.

257
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:42,312
What's up, you two?

258
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,211
Renge, where are you?

259
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,411
Renge!

260
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:50,412
Over there!

261
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:54,411
Rausu! Where's Renge?

262
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:55,812
Hold it, Rausu!

263
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,411
Let's die together, my beloved child!

264
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,511
Let's fall to the pit of darkness together!

265
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:05,211
Let me go! Let me go!

266
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:06,612
Hold it, Phantom!

267
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,812
Let her go!

268
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,712
Renge!

269
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:30,811
Stop it!

270
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:31,911
Sonoko?

271
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,911
Phantom of the Konpira!

272
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:37,411
I already know that you are not Mr. Rausu!

273
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:42,311
I also know that your original purpose was not murder.

274
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:43,411
Isn't that right?

275
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:45,812
Stop all this, Romi!

276
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,011
-What? -No.

277
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:53,012
That's right. You were acting strange to begin with.

278
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:03,311
All of this was what you created and what you acted out.

279
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:06,511
You mean all that was an act? Why'd she do something like that?

280
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,212
Of course is to frame Mr. Rausu.

281
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:20,311
Romi, why?

282
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:23,311
To take revenge on his father.

283
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,511
You mean the former owner of Rausu Concieron who passed away.

284
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:30,011
That former owner overtook my father's business,

285
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:32,111
which lead to my father's illness that eventually killed him.

286
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:34,311
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

287
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,711
What?

288
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:40,011
Being alone, the only thing I could do was to act!

289
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,711
Taking revenge didn't even cross my mind.

290
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,011
That's when I got this offer.

291
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:49,811
I felt as if my father and mother were shouting "now's the time".

292
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:52,211
That's why you accepted my offer.

293
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:55,511
But, I wasn't planning to kill anyone to begin with.

294
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,711
I was satisfied if I could spoil this show

295
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:02,211
and taint the name of the sponsor, Rausu Concieron.

296
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:05,411
That's why I pressured Renge.

297
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:07,611
I thought that she would never make it,

298
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:10,612
that she would spoil the entire show.

299
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,911
But, I made a big mistake.

300
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:19,211
It had slipped my mind, that Renge was also an actress.

301
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,211
If I were her,

302
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,911
I would've used the pressure to give me a boost.

303
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,012
Romi.

304
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:28,612
On top of that, the guy found out.

305
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:35,112
Now all my debts are gone.

306
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,611
Could this be a windfall from heaven?

307
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:42,811
An incomplete avenging of my parents' death would not be forgiven.

308
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:44,311
I felt as if I heard them say, "Kill this guy and frame the other guy

309
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:47,611
to make it look as if he did the killing"!

310
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,711
So, you called Mr. Nabeshima out to the vacant lot,

311
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:53,811
hid behind the monument and waited.

312
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:58,311
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from on top the pedestal,

313
00:15:58,312 --> 00:15:59,911
it had to be someone short.

314
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:02,611
So, I figured that if it were a woman,

315
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:06,011
it's possible that the knife would come right about

316
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,312
where Mr. Nabeshima's neck is.

317
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,511
The luminous tape that was on the cane

318
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,012
was the one that Mr. Rausu had accidentally touched.

319
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,111
The police would most naturally think that Tamanosuke

320
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:28,312
was put unconscious by Mr. Rausu who tried to take Renge away.

321
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:33,611
You then deliberately appeared before Mr. Rausu,

322
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:36,211
and schemed to change your testimony about him later

323
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,711
just so that you could give him a bad image.

324
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:42,411
Moreover, while he was waiting in the park for Tamanosuke,

325
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:45,411
you put the projector into the trunk of his car.

326
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:48,912
But, he found out after all.

327
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:59,212
Come on out! I know you did it!

328
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:07,111
I thought that I had no choice but to carry out what I did to the end.

329
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:11,512
Rausu, who flees from the police, kills himself as well as Renge.

330
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,612
But, even that young lady over there saw through everything.

331
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,412
No, Romi!

332
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,912
What a pitiful, unhappy person.

333
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:50,911
Shoots!

334
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,411
Tamanosuke!

335
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:53,612
Conan!

336
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,011
Romi, you took somebody else's life away,

337
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,211
and now you try to take your own life away.

338
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:27,012
Do you intend to blame what you just did on your parents too?

339
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,411
No matter what reason there may be,

340
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,711
you did what humans should never do.

341
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,811
You must make amends for what you did.

342
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,911
You aren't allowed to die!

343
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:42,211
Besides, you deliberately left the pamphlet of this place

344
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,211
in a conspicuous place like that

345
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,711
because you wanted someone to stop you,

346
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:49,212
from what you were about to do.

347
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:06,211
I'm glad, it's all thanks to you, Sonoko.

348
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,611
Did I do it again?

349
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,412
While you were sleeping, yes.

350
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:14,511
I'm sorry, I'm going to continue acting,

351
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,411
together with the troupe leader, all my life.

352
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,811
Renge.

353
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,112
Okay.

354
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,112
It's a lot of fun!

355
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:16,411
It requires quite a bit of strength.

356
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:18,612
It kind of feels good, though.

357
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,311
Never mind kneading the udon,

358
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:25,612
I really need a glass of beer. I need beer!

359
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,412
He's the same wherever he goes.

360
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,911
Next Conan's Hint:

361
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,812
"Premier ticket"
