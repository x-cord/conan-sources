1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:05,304
The world's largest conch pearl, Fairy Lip.

2
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:09,514
In order to face off against Kid, whose target is the jewel,

3
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:15,064
Hattori and I came to Suzuki Jirokichi's Suzuki Museum.

4
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:19,183
Also there to take on Kid was Inspector Morofushi Takaaki

5
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:22,744
of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,083
But despite that,

7
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:29,824
Kid was able to steal the pearl frozen inside a block of ice.

8
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,823
Find the question that solves the mystery!

9
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:36,863
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,883
Both Kid and Heiji are targeting lips!

11
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,103
Where will the missing jewel and their love end up?

12
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:42,713
Always determining the one truth

13
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,543
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,104
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:32,305
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips (Part Two)

16
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,054
The fairy's lips are mine Kaito Kid

17
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:35,815
Damn it!

18
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,184
I knew the ice wasn't enough to keep it safe!

19
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:43,565
But what are all these rings?

20
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,444
It's a floral ice performance.

21
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:47,365
What?

22
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,245
It's an art that involves drilling holes with an electric drill

23
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:53,074
and using food coloring to stain the ice

24
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:58,245
to make it appear as though there are real flowers inside the ice.

25
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:02,505
Kid simply used that method to create rings instead of flowers,

26
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,005
with unimaginable speed, in order to throw us off.

27
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:10,944
But this room was pitch black.

28
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:12,265
How did he do it?

29
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:15,145
You guys inside didn't see anything?

30
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,355
Nah.

31
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:19,164
Like the old man said, it was pitch black.

32
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:19,935
Yeah.

33
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,645
Maybe he went under the sheet.

34
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:27,155
The clear sheet over the ice was stained black by the ink.

35
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:31,734
He could've drilled the holes by slipping inside and turning on a light.

36
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:36,165
There are tools next to the ice, so that must've been it.

37
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:37,435
I see.

38
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,434
That would allow him to secretly drill the holes.

39
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:40,544
You're right.

40
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:43,675
Since the light couldn't get out, we didn't notice.

41
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,884
I've had enough of this farce.

42
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:46,675
What?

43
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,424
You're the only ones who entered this room.

44
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:53,425
I know one of you is Kid!

45
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,474
You're going to be stripped and thoroughly searched.

46
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:57,435
Prepare yourselves!

47
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:58,935
B-But...

48
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,225
Help, Heiji!

49
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:07,115
He's going to strip me naked!

50
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,865
I-I wouldn't want you to be naked...

51
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,204
I know.

52
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,584
What about the sensor inside the ring?

53
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:18,154
If someone exits through those doors with the ring,

54
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:19,874
the sensor triggers an alarm, right?

55
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,125
That's right.

56
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:26,754
Then wait to search us until after the alarm has sounded.

57
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:27,635
Good thinking, Heiji!

58
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,885
We're leaving the room, okay?

59
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:37,395
If the alarm goes off, I'm arresting both of you.

60
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,525
Fine by me.

61
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:51,645
No...

62
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:52,724
Impossible!

63
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,695
Then how did he...?

64
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,455
How did he get the ring outside?

65
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,574
Heiji, thanks!

66
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:00,955
G-Get off of me.

67
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,375
Kazuha-chan's being so bold.

68
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:08,524
I-In any case, this means neither of us are Kid.

69
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,894
Yeah.

70
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,805
This guy is too easy!

71
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,304
F-Fine...

72
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,845
Time to finish this off.

73
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,955
Oh, no!

74
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:26,684
Because of the commotion over Kid, I forgot to get my phone from the glass box.

75
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,195
You're hopeless.

76
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,295
Hey, Inspector.

77
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,814
Is her phone over there somewhere?

78
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:34,985
Jeez...

79
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,075
Is this it?

80
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,924
Thanks.

81
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:39,985
Here.

82
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,494
So cold.

83
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:44,795
It really is too cold in here.

84
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,044
The AC is too cold.

85
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,904
Hey, the ring's already been stolen.

86
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:51,774
We don't need the ice anymore.

87
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,564
Tell them to turn off the AC.

88
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:54,305
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,805
We need to start collecting fingerprints.

90
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:04,004
But, Inspector, we still don't know how Kid stole the ring.

91
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:07,144
Should we really melt the ice?

92
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,944
Right, Inspector Morofushi?

93
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,875
Don't you agree?

94
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:16,075
No. Let's abandon the ice since Kid managed to get around it.

95
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:19,354
For now, we should search every inch of this room

96
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:23,575
to determine how he entered and where he went.

97
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,955
If you say so...

98
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,094
All right. It's perfect.

99
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
Hey, Kazuha-neechan.

100
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,465
Do you need to use the bathroom?

101
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:36,135
You've been keeping your knees together and crouching this whole time.

102
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:40,224
Th-That's right. I'm a little cold from the AC.

103
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,984
Hey, you shouldn't ask girls that.

104
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,804
If you're going to the bathroom, I'll go with you.

105
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,644
I want to wash this ink off my face.

106
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,444
Y-Yeah.

107
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:51,895
In that case, see you later.

108
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,775
But now that the jewel has been stolen,

109
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,165
I'm going to take what's mine.

110
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,035
The substantial compensation I'm owed.

111
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:05,365
I know.

112
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:13,505
Kansuke-kun, why are you calling so late?

113
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,754
Don't give me that!

114
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:21,984
Komei, you said you'd call once you caught that Kaito whatever thief.

115
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,584
It's way past when he said he'd come.

116
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,224
Why haven't you called?

117
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,145
That's right.

118
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,385
Everyone's waiting at the station for you.

119
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:32,775
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:38,444
The thief left a card saying "the jewel is mine" and vanished.

121
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:41,104
Seriously? He beat you?

122
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,425
What?!

123
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,455
You don't seem very disappointed, though.

124
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:52,715
"A commander neither delights in victory nor despairs in defeat."

125
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,284
A commander does not become overjoyed when he wins,

126
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,724
nor does he become dejected when he loses.

127
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,715
More sayings?

128
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:04,245
Besides, this battle isn't over yet.

129
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,034
More importantly, what about that other thing?

130
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,484
What about the package really addressed to you?

131
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:13,355
I'm planning on picking it up tomorrow.

132
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:16,434
I suppose it's already tomorrow since it's past midnight.

133
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:20,934
But you don't remember the name of the officer

134
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,764
who left the envelope in your locker, right?

135
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:26,134
No, but despite being rather blurry,

136
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,824
the name written on the note stuck to the envelope

137
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,625
could be read as my mine.

138
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:35,754
But do you know anyone in Tokyo?

139
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:39,635
Didn't you have a younger brother at the MPD?

140
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,715
Yes.

141
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:45,635
Perhaps my brother knows the officer who had the package.

142
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:49,594
Why don't you have your brother check it out, then?

143
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,054
He left the force a long time ago.

144
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:56,375
I haven't heard anything from him since he said he found another job.

145
00:08:57,535 --> 00:09:02,765
I have no idea where he is or what he's doing now.

146
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:09,285
Well, since Kid already came and left, let's take a taxi home.

147
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:10,205
What?

148
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,205
Taking a taxi would be a waste.

149
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,375
But there's still about four hours before the trains start running.

150
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:20,194
Then let's take a nap in the museum somewhere.

151
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,434
Yeah.

152
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,634
I'll go ask Jirokichi-san.

153
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,765
I'll go with you.

154
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:31,224
Despite everything, those two sure are close.

155
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,145
I know.

156
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:36,104
No, Heiji-niichan's sticking by her so she doesn't escape.

157
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,525
Escape?

158
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:41,405
That Kazuha-neechan is actually Kaito Kid.

159
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:44,824
What?!

160
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,785
Seriously?

161
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,774
I'm sure of it.

162
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,404
She's been bending her knees this whole time,

163
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:55,334
and the real Kazuha-neechan refers to herself as "atashi,"

164
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:58,295
but that one calls herself "uchi."

165
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:01,024
He's right.

166
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:04,055
Then why is he still here?

167
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:08,475
There's only one possible reason.

168
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,815
It's so soft.

169
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:18,815
I bet you could sleep soundly on this couch.

170
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,184
You're right.

171
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,464
Then let's go get Ran-chan and the others.

172
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:24,814
But I don't like AC units.

173
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:26,825
I doubt I can sleep without a fan.

174
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:31,044
If you can't sleep, I'll sleep next to you.

175
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,124
Wh-What are you talking about?

176
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,064
Just kidding.

177
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:37,045
That would make it harder to sleep.

178
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,245
Enough already.

179
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,365
Everything you've been saying is ridiculous.

180
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,485
What?

181
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:07,945
Looks like I'll have to cover that ridiculous mouth...

182
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,865
in order to keep you quiet.

183
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,365
What?

184
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,745
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

185
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:19,965
Wait!

186
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,495
Wait!

187
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:25,355
Wait!

188
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,555
Looks like I'll have to cover that ridiculous mouth...

189
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:38,315
in order to keep you quiet.

190
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:39,815
Whoa.

191
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:41,315
Whoa.

192
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:42,815
Whoa!

193
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,565
Wait...

194
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,065
Wait!

195
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,235
Wait!

196
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,105
Wha...

197
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:58,315
Wh-What's all the noise for?

198
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,724
Y-You surprised us.

199
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:05,795
W-We came in a hurry since we were so sleepy.

200
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,664
That was close.

201
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:13,055
I can't believe Hattori hasn't noticed that's Kid in disguise.

202
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:16,284
Come to think of it, he did become a crap detective

203
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:20,185
when Kazuha-chan got involved at Ebisubashi Bridge in Osaka.

204
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:24,065
Hey, this room is pretty big.

205
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,815
There's even a soft couch.

206
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:30,865
I wouldn't mind sleeping in here until noon.

207
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,775
After all, I am the Sleeping Kogoro.

208
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,365
Seriously?

209
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,515
It's been about four hours since then.

210
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,245
Should be ready soon.

211
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,794
Hey, it's melted quite a bit.

212
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,565
I was worried since it was around three meters tall,

213
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,195
but it has been hot lately.

214
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:14,835
I'm going to go make my report.

215
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,905
Is something the matter?

216
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:21,415
I seem to have dropped a contact inside the glass box.

217
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:24,004
Could I go in and get it?

218
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,314
Sure.

219
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,524
Thanks.

220
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:29,474
The floor is wet from the melted ice, so be careful.

221
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,675
Okay.

222
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,675
Where was it?

223
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,635
Let's see.

224
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:42,765
All right!

225
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:49,525
The world's largest pearl is mine!

226
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,575
"One hundred saw-wings are no match for one raptor."

227
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:55,945
Wh-What?

228
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,455
Saw-wings refers to sparrows,

229
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:01,075
and the raptor refers to the hawk.

230
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:04,054
In other words, even if a hundred swallows come together,

231
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:07,045
they cannot defeat a single hawk.

232
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,295
It seems you attempted to throw us off

233
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:12,905
by making countless rings appear in the ice,

234
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,125
and drilled a large hole through the middle

235
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:21,165
to make us believe you'd stolen the real ring.

236
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,925
But you can't fool my eyes.

237
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:31,235
One hundred fake rings can't compare to the beauty of a true conch pearl.

238
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:32,824
I see.

239
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:36,115
You knew, so you were waiting to see what I'd do.

240
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,345
Yes.

241
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:41,205
I thought I'd try to catch you in the act.

242
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:46,835
Then naturally, you knew this was my disguise.

243
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,065
Of course.

244
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,504
Your first person pronoun switched from "atashi" to "uchi,"

245
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,735
and you were crouching to make yourself appear shorter.

246
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:58,184
The rest of you noticed as well, right?

247
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:58,825
Uh...

248
00:14:58,825 --> 00:14:59,475
Yeah...

249
00:14:59,475 --> 00:14:59,955
Of—

250
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:00,975
Of course!

251
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:03,054
Seriously?

252
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:05,515
But if you knew all that,

253
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:08,775
you should've retrieved the real ring.

254
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,944
It's all white this time.

255
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,524
Don't panic. It's just a smoke screen.

256
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,164
We can vent all the smoke.

257
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:24,955
Since the entrance is sealed, he'll be caught like a rat in a trap.

258
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,545
The smoke is clearing, and...

259
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,894
What's that hole?

260
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:31,965
When did that get there?

261
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,924
So that's his escape route.

262
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,764
You knew?

263
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:40,154
Yes, but I chose to ignore it.

264
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:45,475
I heard Kaito Kid returns the jewel to its owner if it's not the one he wants.

265
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:50,164
Ah, then it'll be returned to me later.

266
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:55,044
If you're the real owner of the jewel.

267
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,184
What?

268
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:58,264
Didn't you say the pearl was found inside a giant oyster

269
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:03,484
sleeping at the bottom of Mie Prefecture's Ago Bay,

270
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:07,625
and that you were drawn to the pearl's unique orient effect?

271
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,434
Y-Yeah.

272
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:14,954
But real conch pearls are only harvested from pink conches

273
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,064
in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.

274
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:20,505
And it's not the rainbow "orient effect" that defines conch pearls,

275
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:25,095
it's their beautiful "flame pattern" wavy lines.

276
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,985
In other words,

277
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:31,185
you're not the real owner of that jewel.

278
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:35,404
It belongs to that girl who said her grandfather received it as a gift

279
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:38,065
from a wealthy Caribbean man.

280
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:42,084
You can tell us all about it later.

281
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,325
Oh, um, actually...

282
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:49,794
You noticed that gemstone broker was suspicious, too?

283
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:53,824
Yeah, at least I noticed this one was fake right away.

284
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,665
What do you mean, "this one?"

285
00:16:57,425 --> 00:17:02,595
Heiji, are you saying you didn't notice Kid was disguised as me?

286
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:03,925
Y-You idiot!

287
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:06,784
I noticed right away, but I was waiting to see what he'd do!

288
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,225
Tell me, then!

289
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:10,145
What was different?

290
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,745
I-It was...

291
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,145
What?

292
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,394
Th-The seaweed!

293
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:21,225
The fake Kazuha didn't have any seaweed in her teeth!

294
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,905
Ran-chan, I knew it was seaweed!

295
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:29,844
A-Anyway, I wonder where that thief went.

296
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:34,415
It's likely he sped things up because he was suspicious of the jewel's owner,

297
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,915
so he's probably...

298
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,425
I'm sorry, Grandma.

299
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:45,425
I wish you could've taken the jewel you got from grandpa to heaven with you.

300
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,515
But I couldn't get it back.

301
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:50,824
I wish I'd asked you more about that pink pearl

302
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,575
while you were alive.

303
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,864
Exactly 50 years ago,

304
00:17:56,865 --> 00:18:00,614
while a wealthy Caribbean man was traveling around the world by boat,

305
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:05,445
his pregnant wife suddenly went into labor.

306
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:09,224
By chance, your grandfather who was a surgeon

307
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:11,705
happened to be on that same boat on his honeymoon.

308
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,794
Though it wasn't his specialty,

309
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:17,454
he used his medical knowledge to help with the birth

310
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:22,554
And it was with gratitude that the Caribbean man

311
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,845
gave this Fairy Lip to your grandfather.

312
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,465
Yamamoto Moena-san.

313
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:29,845
Y-You're...

314
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,195
Kaito Kid!

315
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:39,384
The details of the event were written on the son's blog in Spanish.

316
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:44,615
That broker probably plotted to steal your jewel after reading it.

317
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:51,115
Unfortunately, this jewel doesn't seem to have been the one I wanted.

318
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:56,825
May I add a touch of color to your grandmother's cruise through the afterlife?

319
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:04,965
Yes.

320
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,745
Of course.

321
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:37,595
What? A package was found in Date-san's locker?

322
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:39,084
Yeah.

323
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:42,874
To be precise, inside the package sent to Date-san

324
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,985
was an envelope with a note asking that it be sent to an inspector in Nagano.

325
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:53,445
We'd left there it since he passed away in a traffic accident one year ago.

326
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,495
The writing on the note had bled, so it was pretty hard to read.

327
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:02,854
Was the sender's name blurry, too?

328
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,625
There wasn't one written.

329
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:07,425
Look, there's only a circle.

330
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:11,444
I can't believe it was left in his locker for a whole year.

331
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,414
I can.

332
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,894
It was stuffed full of things he should've thrown out like photos

333
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,435
and things from his police academy days.

334
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:20,575
Huh?

335
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:24,685
Sato-san, you don't have good memories of the police academy?

336
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:27,544
Of course not.

337
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:32,494
Because Date-san and his class were so unruly,

338
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:37,494
they were unbelievably strict on my class only.

339
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,875
Matsuda-kun was in that class, too.

340
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:45,314
Come to think of it, weren't Date-san and Matsuda-san in the same class?

341
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,795
Why do you only refer to Matsuda-san as Matsuda-kun?

342
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:53,555
Because unlike Date-san, I became a police officer before Matsuda-kun.

343
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:55,175
Is there a problem?

344
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,245
No.

345
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,055
This is the envelope.

346
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:03,904
You're sure it's addressed to you?

347
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,685
Yes.

348
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,534
It is surely addressed to me.

349
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,914
Then let's check its contents.

350
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:09,565
All right.

351
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:13,305
This...

352
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,075
It's a phone.

353
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:18,575
There's a hole through the middle, though.

354
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:20,344
That's definitely a hole.

355
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:22,225
What's it from?

356
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,835
There's a black stain around the inside of the hole,

357
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:30,915
and on the back is a uniquely written H made to look like a scratch.

358
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:36,595
"With life comes death, and life is short."

359
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:37,775
What?

360
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:39,954
"People cannot avoid death."

361
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,884
"Our short lives are destined to end."

362
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:45,975
It's what a Chinese general once said.

363
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:49,245
This phone belonged to my younger brother.

364
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:53,985
He said he quit the force, but if this was delivered here,

365
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:56,824
then he was probably working for the Public Security Agency

366
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:59,735
and lost his life while working undercover.

367
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:03,765
After all, this is probably a bullet hole, and this black stain is probably blood.

368
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,685
Right?

369
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:09,014
Morofushi Takaaki-sama

370
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,005
Bro, starting today, I'm a cop too!

371
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:11,935
Hiromitsu...

372
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,585
Metropolitan Police Department

373
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,524
Thank you for today.

374
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:19,435
Not at all. Thank you for coming.

375
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:29,225
Bro!

376
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:32,735
I made a friend in Tokyo.

377
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:35,465
His nickname is Zero.

378
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:41,525
Pretty cool, right?
