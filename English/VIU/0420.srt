1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,318
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,618
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,018
Thoughtfulness and kindness for the one you love.

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,518
Brings about misunderstanding,

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,218
but at long last, the true killer is found in the homeland of mythology.

6
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:10,818
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:12,718
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,919
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:59,483
We came on a sightseeing trip to Izumo, the homeland of mythology,

10
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:03,384
and we become acquainted with a woman named Eiko Esumi there.

11
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:08,583
The following day, Eiko's fiance is killed

12
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:12,384
and a robbery case of a sword worth 10,000,000 yen occurs.

13
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:17,683
And of the four suspects that were summoned to the police

14
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:21,383
were Eiko and her childhood friend.

15
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:25,183
Please tell me where and what each of you were doing

16
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,083
at around 13:00 yesterday.

17
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:30,083
It was my day off yesterday,

18
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,383
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

19
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,083
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

20
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,983
I was at Hinomisaki.

21
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:41,883
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

22
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:43,083
No.

23
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,283
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

24
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,284
Could it be that they're lying?

25
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:55,384
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 2)"

26
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,483
Are you sure you didn't see wrong?

27
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,583
Of course not.

28
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:02,683
I've known her since she was born.

29
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,783
She was Eiko of Hinodeya.

30
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,683
It was after noon yesterday?

31
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,483
Yep. Just about 13:00.

32
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:13,484
She always sits on that chair over there.

33
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:18,784
Eiko was here at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed?

34
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,183
Since there's a witness, Eiko's alibi's been established.

35
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,783
But why did she say she was at Hinomisaki?

36
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,184
Let's go tell Pops and the others.

37
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:33,183
It's just as she and Conan are saying.

38
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:36,783
I was at Old Taisha Station.

39
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,283
-What? -What?

40
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,483
I go there a lot when I have time.

41
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:45,483
I feel relaxed when I go there.

42
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:48,484
It is also the place where the history of my mother and father started.

43
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:53,683
My mother happened to stop by when on a trip and came here to Izumo.

44
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,383
She just happened to spend the night at my father's inn.

45
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:59,683
They were both attracted to each other and eventually got married.

46
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,583
Then I was born.

47
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,283
Although the railroad line has already been discontinued,

48
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:05,683
when I go there,

49
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:08,483
I feel like I can see the beginning of everything.

50
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:11,583
I like that station.

51
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,883
No matter how much you look for witnesses who've seen Eiko at Hinomisaki,

52
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:17,083
you wouldn't find them

53
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,384
because she didn't go there.

54
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,783
If you were at Old Taisha Station,

55
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:25,583
why didn't you say so to begin with?

56
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,883
Why did you lie about it?

57
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,583
Well...

58
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:32,183
Because Mr. Fukuma said what he did, right?

59
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,184
What?

60
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:36,183
It was my day off yesterday,

61
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,583
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

62
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:42,083
You were more surprised than anyone else back then, weren't you, Eiko?

63
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:47,183
Because you were there, but Mr. Fukuma wasn't.

64
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:49,083
He killed Mr. Wanibuchi for me,

65
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:52,683
that's the only thing I could think of.

66
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:57,983
So I couldn't tell the truth if I mentioned Old Taisha Station.

67
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,083
It would contradict his.

68
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:03,684
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses.

69
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,483
If we were at the same place,

70
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:09,083
there's no way that we wouldn't have seen each other.

71
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:14,883
Since Mr. Fukuma lied before you, you couldn't help but lie.

72
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:18,283
Hinomisaki just happened to cross my mind

73
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,283
since I like it there, too.

74
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,683
I see, so that's the story.

75
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:25,083
But if Ms. Esumi is innocent,

76
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,383
Mr. Fukuma's activities become questionable.

77
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:35,183
He took the sword away from the murder site not to protect Ms. Esumi,

78
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,383
but to hide what he did.

79
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,184
I don't think that's right.

80
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:46,383
Eiko as well as Mr. Fukuma just had a mutual misunderstanding.

81
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:48,683
A mutual misunderstanding?

82
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:51,883
If you tell Mr. Fukuma that Eiko has been cleared from suspicion,

83
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,783
I'm sure he'll tell you everything.

84
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,684
I'll bring Fukuma here.

85
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,283
Eiko, it wasn't you?

86
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:05,883
I was at Old Taisha Station right through.

87
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:09,383
But then, why?

88
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,684
Was this there?

89
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,683
What is this?

90
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,483
Where did you find this?

91
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,284
Where else?

92
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:24,383
Could you explain in chronological order please?

93
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,583
Yes.

94
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:30,483
Yesterday at noon, I did go to Inome Cave.

95
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:34,783
But it wasn't to kill Mr. Wanibuchi.

96
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:38,383
The day before yesterday, Eiko told me that...

97
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:40,783
she was called out by Wanibuchi.

98
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,883
He told me to come to Inome Cave at 13:30.

99
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,183
Why's he asking you to come to a lonely place like that?

100
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:50,783
I'm sure he's up to no good.

101
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,183
Don't go!

102
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,783
I'll go in place of you.

103
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,183
I'll have a good talk with him

104
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,083
and make him give you up, once and for all.

105
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,383
Ryo.

106
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,984
Noon tomorrow, at 13:30.

107
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,984
So yesterday, in order to talk it out with him...

108
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,284
Wanibuchi?

109
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:17,784
Eiko?

110
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:21,383
You found this there?

111
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:24,883
I recognized it right away because this is what I gave you.

112
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:27,783
I will have to keep it for a while.

113
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,583
The key is this pendant.

114
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:34,683
I thought you went despite me telling you not to go.

115
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,783
Thinking that Eiko had killed him,

116
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:41,583
you impulsively stole the sword to make it look like a robbery?

117
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:44,083
Oh, yes.

118
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,983
The story makes sense.

119
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:48,483
I'm sorry, Ryo.

120
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:52,483
I lost that pendant several days ago.

121
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,183
I couldn't make myself tell you.

122
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:57,083
So that's what you meant, Conan,

123
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,883
when you said they had a mutual misunderstanding.

124
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:02,883
They both thought that their partner was the killer.

125
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:06,483
They both lied to protect each other.

126
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:09,683
How cute. How so very cute.

127
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,083
It's not cute!

128
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:14,683
How dare you both confuse the case the way you did!

129
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:18,683
Mr. Fukuma, you stealing the sword is nothing other than a crime!

130
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,383
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,883
If you didn't take the pendant away,

132
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:26,383
maybe the fingerprints of the real killer were on them!

133
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:30,383
I completely thought it was Eiko, so I...

134
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,883
If so, the more so!

135
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,984
Trying to cover up somebody else's crime is not love!

136
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,283
Ryo.

137
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,183
I understand.

138
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:45,883
Which means that the one who killed Mr. Wanibuchi is Kazuya Ishitobi.

139
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:50,383
That jittery attitude of Mr. Ishitobi sure is worth suspecting.

140
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,983
The way Mr. Fujie acted surprised

141
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:56,583
when I introduced myself also bothers me.

142
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:00,283
The real killer had this pendant, right?

143
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:01,783
Probably.

144
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:05,683
And he dropped it when he killed Mr. Wanibuchi.

145
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:08,884
Rather, he deliberately put it near the corpse!

146
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,383
You said you lost it several days ago, didn't you?

147
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:17,883
Before that, did you see Mr. Ishitobi or Mr. Fujie?

148
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:19,183
Come to think of it...

149
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,183
Come on, Eiko!

150
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:25,083
If it's for you who he loves, I'm sure he'll listen.

151
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:30,283
Marry him and please tell him not to take us over!

152
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,483
Please!

153
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:34,383
Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Fujie?

154
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:37,783
Are saying you want our daughter to sacrifice herself

155
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,783
for the sake of saving your wedding hall?

156
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:43,683
I'm pleading knowing what a selfish request this is.

157
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,683
Please. Eiko, please!

158
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,283
Please let me think it over.

159
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:51,583
Eiko, there's no need to think it over!

160
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,383
Please leave, Mr. Fujie.

161
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,883
How cruel

162
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:59,283
to tell you to sacrifice yourself for his own convenience. Eiko...

163
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:01,483
Come to think of it,

164
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,984
it was after that, I realized that I had lost the pendant.

165
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,483
So, it's Mr. Fujie.

166
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:11,383
But Mr. Fujie has the alibi of having been at Matsue Castle.

167
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:14,283
His name was on the name list of the castle tower.

168
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:18,383
Let's go take a look at Matsue Castle, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,383
Right, if the killer didn't try to frame Eiko up as the killer,

170
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:25,984
Mr. Fukuma wouldn't have had to steal the sword, too!

171
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:38,283
This distinct way of writing is unmistakably Mr. Fujie's writing.

172
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,483
Judging from what's written before and after his signature,

173
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,383
13:05 doesn't seem to be a lie.

174
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,183
I guess it was just a waste of time.

175
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:47,983
I just thought there may be a possibility.

176
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,083
Which means, there's only one person left.

177
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,284
Let's hurry back.

178
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:55,483
Conan?

179
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:58,783
Okay! I'll catch up with you right away, so go ahead.

180
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,684
Really? Right away, okay?

181
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:04,883
Something is bothering me.

182
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,684
The time here fits in too well.

183
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,983
What is going on?

184
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:15,883
Logging in the time suddenly started from yesterday?

185
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,983
Hey, will you lend me your eraser?

186
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,483
I can't seem to do it well.

187
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:24,383
If written in a pencil, it could be erased.

188
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,083
But this, you can't.

189
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,684
No, maybe...

190
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,184
Hey, will you please lend me your eraser?

191
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,983
Hey, Ran! Hurry up!

192
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:38,783
Yep! Wait!

193
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,783
Conan's not here yet!

194
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,883
Not that brat again.

195
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:44,883
Wait, Pops!

196
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:45,984
We're leaving you behind!

197
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,483
Yes, this is Yamane.

198
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,484
What?

199
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,083
Yeah, okay.

200
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,783
Mr. Ishitobi couldn't have committed the crime.

201
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,383
Yesterday, a little after noon time,

202
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,983
in the suburbs of Izumo,

203
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:03,383
there was a hit and run accident around 13:00.

204
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:06,883
At about the same time, Mr. Wanibuchi was killed in Inome Cave.

205
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,083
And?

206
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:12,983
The driver was finally found through eye-witness reports

207
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,083
and just arrested.

208
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:16,983
It is Mr. Ishitobi.

209
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,084
What?

210
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,783
I get it.

211
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:25,483
He wasn't jittery because he killed Mr. Wanibuchi,

212
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,283
but because he was afraid we would find out about his hit-and-run case.

213
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:31,283
But if so, what about this case?

214
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,883
It's not Mr. Fukuma or Ms. Esumi.

215
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,483
Mr. Fujie has a definite alibi

216
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:39,983
and the possibility of Mr. Ishitobi being the suspect is gone.

217
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,883
All the suspects are innocent.

218
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:43,984
Right.

219
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:47,583
Mr. Mouri!

220
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,483
Dad, are you all right?

221
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,083
So we're back where we started.

222
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:53,384
Pops.

223
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,583
Yes, I'm Fujie.

224
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:13,083
This is Mouri, I'd like to see you.

225
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,683
I'll leave the time and place up to you.

226
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:18,284
I'll tell you the reason when I see you in person.

227
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,083
Yes, Mouri here.

228
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,883
This is Fujie. I have something I want to talk to you about.

229
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:28,083
You want to talk to me?

230
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,584
I'll be waiting for you at Hinomisaki.

231
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:40,377
What a magnificent lighthouse it is!

232
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:41,378
Yes.

233
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:46,177
It's 43.65 meters and is said to be tallest in Japan.

234
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:48,077
What a beautiful lighthouse!

235
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,777
It was built in Meiji 36 or 1903.

236
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:56,677
So it's been here for over 100 years.

237
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:57,678
100 years.

238
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,677
And he said to wait for him at Hinomisaki, but where?

239
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,177
That's right.

240
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:06,377
At this time, the lighthouse is already closed,

241
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,677
so it must be that observatory up ahead.

242
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:09,777
Let's go.

243
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:10,778
Yes.

244
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,278
What could he want to talk to me about?

245
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,177
Mr. Fujie, thank you for waiting.

246
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,877
What did you want to talk to me about?

247
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,978
Aren't you the one who asked me to come?

248
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:31,077
Please, may I meet someone nice?

249
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,277
He's here! The Sleeping Kogoro!

250
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,977
Sleeping Kogoro?

251
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,478
So this is the rumoured...

252
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,777
Mr. Fujie, you analogized Mr. Wanibuchi to the Eight-forked serpent.

253
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:50,177
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

254
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:53,277
A monster that swallows up whatever it targets as prey.

255
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,077
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

256
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:02,077
It's true that Mr. Wanibuchi may have been a hated existence.

257
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,678
But that doesn't mean it's okay to kill him, Mr. Fujie.

258
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:11,177
What a thing to say.

259
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,677
Is it about that again, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,477
That's right, Mr. Mouri.

261
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:20,777
You even confirmed his alibi at Matsue Castle yourself!

262
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:23,277
That was a trick.

263
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,177
A trick?

264
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:27,277
You thought of killing Mr. Wanibuchi

265
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,578
when you went to Eiko's house several days ago, isn't that right?

266
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,577
You pleaded with Eiko, asking her to marry Mr. Wanibuchi

267
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:42,177
and to ask him to quit taking over your wedding hall.

268
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:48,077
But of course, the selfish plea was not heard.

269
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,478
And in your grief...

270
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:55,578
You happened to pick up something you didn't expect to.

271
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:02,577
A thought flashed through your mind.

272
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,477
You made two calls the day before yesterday, didn't you?

273
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,777
One was to Mr. Wanibuchi.

274
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,777
It went something like this.

275
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:15,377
I'll give you a great idea on how to make Ms. Eiko Esumi your very own.

276
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:18,177
It's best for both of us to meet where there aren't many people.

277
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,977
I'll see you at Inome tomorrow at 13:00 then.

278
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:23,877
Your other call was to Eiko.

279
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,578
You pretended to be Mr. Wanibuchi.

280
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,877
I want to see you tomorrow,

281
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,677
please come to Inome at 13:30 tomorrow.

282
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,577
That phone call wasn't from Mr. Wanibuchi?

283
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,777
He used Mr. Wanibuchi's tone of voice.

284
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,177
Come to think of it, he said he had a cold.

285
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:39,577
His voice was not like always.

286
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:43,677
13:00 and 13:30, you designated different time

287
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:48,677
because you didn't want Eiko to witness you killing Mr. Wanibuchi.

288
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:51,777
And yesterday at 13:00,

289
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,378
you carried out your scheme.

290
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,777
Mr. Wanibuchi's wristwatch stopping at 13:05 was not what you planned,

291
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,677
but you had no choice but to carry out what you did.

292
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,977
So you sped over to Matsue Castle by car

293
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:13,977
to log your name in on the name list and establish your alibi.

294
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:17,077
It would be impossible to log in from that time, Mr. Mouri.

295
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,777
No matter how fast you drive there by car,

296
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,977
you can get to Matsue Castle only after 14:00!

297
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:22,677
It's not impossible.

298
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:26,977
You went to Matsue Castle twice yesterday, didn't you?

299
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:27,978
Twice?

300
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:31,778
First, it was early in the morning, in order to set up the trick.

301
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:03,377
You used an alias and logged in your name and the time

302
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,377
and at the same time you switched the pens.

303
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,377
Switched the pens?

304
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,277
You switched the pen to one you could erase using an eraser.

305
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:15,577
After killing Mr. Wanibuchi, you went back to Matsue Castle again

306
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:19,078
and looked for a random log in around 13:00.

307
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:37,477
So the very moment that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed,

308
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:39,777
your alibi that you were at Matsue Castle,

309
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,977
an hour away from the murder site was established.

310
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:45,277
It was a false alibi.

311
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,177
It can easily be proven if you try it out.

312
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:50,478
There are ball pens that can be erased using erasers.

313
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,077
When you think about it,

314
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,177
when logging in on name lists like these,

315
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,377
the name, address and date are written,

316
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,377
but the time is usually not written.

317
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,077
The fact is, nobody was writing in the time

318
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,777
until the day before yesterday.

319
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,277
However, yesterday,

320
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,577
since the first person wrote in the time,

321
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,777
everyone started logging in the same way.

322
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:12,877
If the first person writes something in a certain way,

323
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,777
everyone who follows thinks that it is to be done this way

324
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:19,877
and follows the first pattern without hesitation.

325
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:23,177
You used this behaviour of people to carry out your trick.

326
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,977
How about it, Mr. Fujie?

327
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,477
What proof do you have

328
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:31,177
that I am the first one who logged in yesterday morning?

329
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:34,577
The name Icihiro Yamada sure sounds like an alias,

330
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:37,877
but the problem is the address, Naruse-shi, Tokyo.

331
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,677
Naruse-shi, Tokyo?

332
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,677
So what makes you say that I wrote it?

333
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:46,177
Why is Naruse-shi a problem?

334
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:51,277
Mr. Fujie, you used to live in Tokyo during your university days, right?

335
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,977
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

336
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,477
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

337
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,977
I confirmed and found out

338
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:02,077
that the dormitory that you lived in four years ago

339
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,077
was located in Naruse-shi.

340
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,777
That only shows that there is a point of contact.

341
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:08,177
But that's no answer.

342
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,177
It could be that a person by the name of Ichiro Yamada

343
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,777
who actually came and wrote it, right?

344
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,777
That's not possible,

345
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:18,977
because a place called Naruse-shi does not exist in Tokyo anymore.

346
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:19,978
What?

347
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,377
It merged with Haido-cho that is next to it,

348
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,578
and the name Naruse-shi is gone since a year ago.

349
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:30,478
You didn't know until now, did you?

350
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:38,377
I see. Naruse-shi doesn't exist anymore.

351
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,977
Mr. Mouri, the fact is back then,

352
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,577
I thought I was doomed already.

353
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,477
I'm Mouri.

354
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,877
That famed detective?

355
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:51,777
I figured that you'd disclosed the truth in time.

356
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:53,078
It's just as I thought after all.

357
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,777
How beautiful.

358
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:10,177
I love the sunset that is viewed from Hinomisaki.

359
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,477
I won't be able to see it for some time now.

360
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,578
I wanted to take a good look at it so I wouldn't forget it.

361
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:23,277
I know how selfish I am.

362
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:24,877
Despite knowing this,

363
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:29,477
I didn't want Wanibuchi to take over my precious business.

364
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:32,677
I didn't want the monster to swallow it.

365
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:34,377
I was desperate.

366
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,077
I know.

367
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,877
-Fukuma. -Yes?

368
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:40,277
Be sure you protect Eiko.

369
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,078
Who knows what monster would appear again in the future.

370
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:45,978
I will.

371
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,577
What a beautiful sunset!

372
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:52,977
Conan!

373
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,577
Where were you this whole time?

374
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:58,177
Hey, I hope things work out for the two.

375
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,977
I'm sure they'll work out just fine.

376
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,878
After all, they were born in the land where the God of matchmaking resides.

377
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,778
There!

378
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:40,277
I'm not going back to Tokyo until the coin makes it in there!

379
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:42,078
This time for sure! There!

380
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:44,578
I did it!

381
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:45,578
No way.

382
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,877
No! Oh, no!

383
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,277
Dad.

384
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,477
Hey, hey.

385
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:56,478
I don't think it's cool to interfere with other people's wishes.

386
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:58,878
"Next Episode"

387
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,577
10 years later, on this day,

388
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:04,277
before the sun sets at that memorable place.

389
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,277
November 24th, 4th grade, class A,

390
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:09,877
Kinoshita...

391
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:13,878
"The Hint Is: Animal" -This could be a code that indicates the place.

392
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:21,578
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

393
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:27,878
Next Conan, "Ginkgo Colored First Love (Part 1)"

394
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,877
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,177
"The promise of 10 years later."

396
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,477
Next is the love story of you-know-who.

397
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:50,977
It's not that way with Shinichi and me anymore.

398
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,177
No, it's not about you, Ran.

399
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:53,178
What?
