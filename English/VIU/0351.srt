1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,971
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:06,071
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,771
Tracking down a cell phone case leads us to

4
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:09,571
revealing an unexpected case.

5
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:10,971
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,971
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,372
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:59,831
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 2)"

9
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,219
Thank you very much!

10
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,118
Yes.

11
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,118
I see. Yes.

12
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,318
I understand.

13
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,818
Yes, thank you.

14
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,018
And?

15
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,818
I found three prospective people!

16
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,518
They called from day before yesterday to today.

17
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,118
Three people?

18
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,918
And? What did they have to say?

19
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,918
The first one said he wanted to go the interview site of a company

20
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,018
but forgot the paper that he had written the address on at home

21
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:31,318
and said he may be excluded from the interview if they found out.

22
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,418
And asked to somehow have them give him the address.

23
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,918
The second call was from a man

24
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,318
who said his daughter who had run away from home

25
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,318
and that he wanted to specify

26
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,318
from where the phone call was placed.

27
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,718
The third call was from a person who said that the cell phone

28
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,918
of a person who he had befriended during his trip

29
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,318
was mistakenly mixed up in his bag.

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,118
He wanted to thank that person

31
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,818
as well as return the cell phone

32
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,618
so he wanted the name and address of that person.

33
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:00,818
He's the one!

34
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,518
He's the only one who mentioned cell phone so far!

35
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,818
Yes!

36
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,718
On top of that, only this last person

37
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,218
asked to have the phone number too.

38
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,318
And, what's the number?

39
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,918
Well, since they were going to refuse answering him,

40
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,918
they didn't take his number down.

41
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,618
Besides, all three seem to have called from outside

42
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,518
and not their residence,

43
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,218
so they don't know who called at all.

44
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,418
-From outside? -Yup.

45
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,118
One called the day before yesterday

46
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,118
from the platform of Beika Station,

47
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:32,218
the next one called yesterday at noon from sports shop Apollo

48
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,818
and yesterday at sundown

49
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,518
another called from Restaurant Colombo.

50
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,218
The problem is...

51
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,418
they don't remember which person it was

52
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:46,418
that asked for the cell phone number.

53
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,418
Oh, right.

54
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,818
It seems that only the person who asked for the phone number

55
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,618
suddenly hung the phone up from his side.

56
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,718
Suddenly?

57
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,118
Yes. They say they heard a sound

58
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,918
on the other side of the line at that time.

59
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,118
A sound that interrupted conversation.

60
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,719
A loud sound.

61
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,118
Well, it seems to have been so sudden that

62
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:10,918
they didn't seem to have time to make out what the sound of the was.

63
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,718
I guess we have no choice but to get in touch

64
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,119
with the place that these three people called.

65
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,118
I've passed one of the universities that I applied.

66
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,018
Oh, I'm happy for you!

67
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,218
Thanks.

68
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,218
I guess you're relieved.

69
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,719
Here's your change.

70
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,818
Now, for the first one.

71
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,919
Yes.

72
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,918
The Tohto Kanjo Line will be coming in shortly!

73
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,718
What? The public phone on the platform?

74
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,318
The night before last.

75
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,418
There were many passengers using the phone so...

76
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,518
I thought so.

77
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,318
I mean I understand.

78
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,518
Hey! Could it be that guy?

79
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,618
You know that person who was standing in front of the phone

80
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,118
that looked to be contemplating whether to call or not.

81
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:59,318
Come to think of it, yeah.

82
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,718
He was wearing this expensive looking coat,

83
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,718
with a frightening and taut look.

84
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,618
He comes around to the station recently.

85
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,018
Didn't you hear a loud sound in the background

86
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,618
when this person was on the phone?

87
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:11,718
A loud sound?

88
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:12,818
Yes.

89
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,118
Of course, all the time!

90
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:19,318
Because this is a train station after all. See!

91
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,818
The train for Kenbashi will be coming shortly.

92
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,218
Please stand behind the white line.

93
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,318
Oh!

94
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,918
The announcement at the train station!

95
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,218
-Hello? -It's true that you can hardly hear.

96
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,118
Hello!

97
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,218
Did you hear that? That's the loud sound.

98
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,618
Thank you. I understand very well now.

99
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,418
But, do you happen to have any other information

100
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,318
on that frightening man?

101
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,818
Yeah, maybe I'll see him again tonight.

102
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,718
I see him a lot recently on the platform.

103
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,718
Well, if you see him, please contact us!

104
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,018
Yes, all right.

105
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,318
Thank you for your help!

106
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,718
Yes!

107
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,318
About noon yesterday, there was a man with a short hair cut

108
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,518
that came here asking to use the phone. He's the one, right?

109
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,318
He said that the battery of his cell phone went dead

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,618
and that he had no loose change either,

111
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:14,618
so he wanted to borrow the phone.

112
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,318
A loud noise?

113
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,418
Yes.

114
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,918
Was there noise loud enough back then

115
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,518
that you had to stop talking?

116
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,518
Yeah. I'm sure you're referring to the sound of the construction

117
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,618
that's been going on for about a week in front of the bank.

118
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,019
See! It's started again!

119
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,918
It's like this intermittently from a little after noon time!

120
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,618
The sound of construction.

121
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,418
Huh? About sundown yesterday?

122
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,018
Oh! He must be one of our customers!

123
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,018
He's reticent and always wearing light colored sunglasses.

124
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,618
He unusually seems to have forgotten his cell phone

125
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:56,818
and asked for loose change in order to use the phone.

126
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,818
So, I remember him well.

127
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,418
Huh? A loud noise?

128
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,618
Yes, did you hear a noise loud enough that you had to stop talking?

129
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,718
I wonder. This road is known for being quiet.

130
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,519
Hello, everyone!

131
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:18,318
I, Shuhei Baisho with your ballot, with you voting for me

132
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,318
will work along with you to create a quiet town!

133
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,718
Did you hear that loud sound?

134
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,618
It's like this every noon and at sundown.

135
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,518
It seems that the campaign car usually takes this route.

136
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,518
A political campaign car.

137
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,418
When will that customer come to your shop again?

138
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,518
He comes everyday,

139
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,618
so when he comes again, I'll give you a call.

140
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:42,318
Thank you. I'll be waiting for you to call me then.

141
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,918
All of them sure sound suspicious.

142
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,818
All of the three cases seem to fit the description.

143
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,818
This is?

144
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,318
Huh?

145
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,818
What's this? This cell phone is strange!

146
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,918
Look at it, Pops. See.

147
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,718
Kid! Don't tell me you broke it?

148
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,218
No. The phone numbers that are saved in this cell phone.

149
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,519
Most of them start with the same four numbers.

150
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,518
1028.

151
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,718
1025. True.

152
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:22,718
Almost all the figures are similar.

153
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,018
Maybe they all live in the same neighborhood!

154
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,918
Stupid! I just told you

155
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,318
that there are no 10 digit numbers that start with 1.

156
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:36,618
I'm pretty sure that the owner of this cell phone, that chubby man

157
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:39,018
who got to know people on the job or something,

158
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,618
put numbers in order besides their names.

159
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:45,619
Hey. Among those numbers, which are the smallest ones?

160
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,719
This is it.

161
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:54,418
It's more than 1,000. He sure knows a lot of people.

162
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,218
Yeah. Maybe he was a door to door sales man

163
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:01,518
and just numbering his customers.

164
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,218
Then what is the number behind it supposed to be?

165
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,218
And this! What about this black dot?

166
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:10,519
Some are marked and some are not.

167
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,018
Maybe he marked the people

168
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,918
who are prospective buyers with the black dot.

169
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,718
The number towards the end like "150" and "600"

170
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,318
could be number of products he sold, or...

171
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,018
If so, that's strange?

172
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,118
Because there are no people before the numbers 1022,

173
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,918
that are at the start of the all the numbers,

174
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,418
and see look carefully!

175
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,019
There are two people with the number "1031"!

176
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,019
One.

177
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,718
Two.

178
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,118
True.

179
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,318
And, this too.

180
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,618
There's a person numbered 1101

181
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:51,518
but why isn't there anyone with the numbers 1032 to 1100?

182
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,918
If he was numbering everyone in order,

183
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,918
why does the number jump suddenly from 1031 to 1101?

184
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,118
Could it be that...

185
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,718
it's a calendar?

186
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,918
Calendar?

187
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,218
1031, October 31st.

188
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:11,818
1101, November 1st and so forth.

189
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,418
I see!

190
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,418
Everything falls in place that way.

191
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,818
Hold it.

192
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,218
If this number stands for the end of October last year

193
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,018
and this other one the 1st of November,

194
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,118
it's just about the time the Tohto Congress election was held.

195
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,019
Oh!

196
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,018
Besides, back then it was a pretty busy time

197
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,618
with the community baseball tournament

198
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,518
and preparations for the autumn festival and all.

199
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,718
So, it's for sure that this guy's not from this community.

200
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,119
Hey! That's not the point.

201
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:41,918
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,919
No problem.

203
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,218
If the four digits at the top are dates,

204
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:50,518
the numbers behind them could be the time that he made the visit.

205
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,518
"150", 1:50.

206
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,718
"600", 6:00 sharp.

207
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:57,018
Then why are the surnames written in Kanji

208
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,618
and the names in Katakana?

209
00:10:58,619 --> 00:10:59,718
Because when he visits the house,

210
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:02,118
the surname is written on the name plate,

211
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:07,318
but he can only get the name of the person after he talks to them.

212
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,218
It could be that the person was angry at the guy

213
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,618
for selling him something he didn't want.

214
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,418
What? Who?

215
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,518
The guy who called using an a number that was not displayed.

216
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,518
The one who shouted for the owner of the cell phone to take the call.

217
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,018
And the same one who called the telephone company

218
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,318
asking for the name and address of the owner of the cell phone.

219
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:26,918
The man with the frightening face.

220
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,918
If we can find out who and where he is,

221
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,218
we can get the phone number of this cell phone from him

222
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:37,318
and figure out the identity of the chubby guy.

223
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:43,518
Darn! We wouldn't have to think so hard if that guy didn't die.

224
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,918
I wonder if that's how it really is.

225
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,118
It's strange after all.

226
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,818
The place where that cell phone was forgotten.

227
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,018
It's strange that it was folded in two,

228
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,618
with the antenna sticking out and under the sofa.

229
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,518
That's true, that it's strange.

230
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,018
It's as if the cell phone was asking for someone to find it.

231
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,318
Talking of the phone ringing,

232
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,590
the gruff person who was the second one to call said,

233
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,819
"Did it ring?"

234
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,418
Maybe the chubby man made the gruff man call

235
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,718
and was planning to secretly give him the cell phone.

236
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,118
Don't be silly.

237
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,318
Then, why didn't he call the gruff man over to this shop?

238
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,618
If the phone rings, the employee of the shop would find it first

239
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,818
and he could never give it away secretly, could he?

240
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,618
Exactly! It's just as Pops says!

241
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,118
-Right? -He would never come back for something

242
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,918
he was planning to hand over secretly!

243
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,718
He couldn't have made mistake as to the place either.

244
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,818
Mistake?

245
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:46,918
You know, like I always make a mistake too.

246
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,918
Come to think of it, before getting run over,

247
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,318
the chubby man asked for directions at the convenience store.

248
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:54,618
I see! That's right.

249
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,618
If he wasn't familiar with this place,

250
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,118
there's a possibility of him making a mistake.

251
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:02,318
Then, the most suspicious would be...

252
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,518
Apollo!

253
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,218
He could've made a mistake because this shop Poirot

254
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,718
sounds similar to Apollo, the sports shop?

255
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,118
I see!

256
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:13,818
But, Azusa, I think it's hard to believe that

257
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,418
he'd mistake a sports shop for this coffee shop, don't you?

258
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,518
I guess so.

259
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,018
Azusa!

260
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:24,318
Why is the name of this shop called Poirot?

261
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:29,018
Yup. I wonder if you know, Hercule Poirot.

262
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,718
The master likes him, that's where we got the name!

263
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,918
Conan, do you know Poirot?

264
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,618
The man's that a bit plump.

265
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,218
Yup! I've seen him on TV!

266
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,718
He's the one that always says, "You know, my wife she..."

267
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,418
The detective that's wearing the wrinkled up coat, right?

268
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:46,018
No!

269
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,818
He's not Poirot, but Colom...

270
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,018
Bo...

271
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,918
Don't tell me!

272
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,318
Maybe he made a mistake because they're both detectives?

273
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:58,618
Besides, Colombo is located on 5-chome like we are.

274
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:00,518
So, if that chubby man

275
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,518
remembered the shop as one on 5-chome that has the name of detective,

276
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,118
it's understandable that he would make a mistake.

277
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,018
Let's go!

278
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,019
Where to?

279
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,518
Where else?

280
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,218
The other detective's shop!

281
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:17,218
-Wait! -Hey! I'm going too!

282
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,518
Me too!

283
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,919
The identity of the chubby man is becoming clear!

284
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:31,860
The man with the sunglasses that I told you about over the phone

285
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,260
hasn't come yet.

286
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:34,460
Oh, yeah?

287
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:37,060
Could we wait for him here, then?

288
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,160
Yeah.

289
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,160
Are you going to be all right, Azusa,

290
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,660
taking off from work like this?

291
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,860
Yes. Master's there

292
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,960
and as long as go back by sundown when it'll start getting busy.

293
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm so concerned that I can't work this way anyway.

294
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:50,060
Hey, mister!

295
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:53,060
Did that customer ask you something?

296
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,360
Yeah.

297
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,860
From just a while ago, each time he comes here, he keeps asking me

298
00:14:56,861 --> 00:15:00,660
whether anybody found a forgotten cell phone here.

299
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,860
Just as I thought.

300
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,961
-There seems to be no doubt about it. -Right.

301
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh! There he is.

302
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,460
Welcome!

303
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:16,460
It's him. But what did you want with him?

304
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,461
Oh, just a little something.

305
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,560
I'll go talk to him.

306
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:24,060
If I talk to him, I'm pretty sure I can tell

307
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,860
whether he's the person who called or not.

308
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:28,060
No! I'll go first!

309
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,961
-Huh? -In times like this, men should go first.

310
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,860
What's the matter, Mr. Detective?

311
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,160
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

312
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:46,460
Talk to that man after you hear my deduction out.

313
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:51,360
First for the strange names in Katakana that were in this cell phone.

314
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:53,560
Although it's made to look like names of people at first glance,

315
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:57,360
these are actually the short form of a certain name.

316
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:58,860
A certain name?

317
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:00,860
Please show me the cell phone.

318
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,360
Just what do you mean?

319
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,360
There are names that are saved on the cell phone

320
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,760
that are very unnatural as names of people, aren't there?

321
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,760
Could you be referring to Sho Kenbashi and Chiyo Daitoma?

322
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,660
True. I've heard of places named like that,

323
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:19,560
but not so with the names of people.

324
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:24,260
Right! Those probably are the names of place.

325
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,860
For example, Sho Kenbashi stands for Kenbashi Shopping Arcade

326
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,160
and Chiyo Daitoma stands for Daitoma Community.

327
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:32,860
True that it falls into place if so.

328
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,160
Ken Aida stands for Aida Construction Company.

329
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,360
Seisaku Ishizawa stands for Ishizawa Manufacturing Company.

330
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,960
Furthermore, the 10 digit numbers that are

331
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,760
registered together with the names.

332
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,660
The 4 numbers at the top are dates.

333
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:47,660
The numbers after that denotes cash,

334
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:49,160
and the black dot shows that the company in question

335
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,660
is in the black.

336
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,960
In other words, it's about income.

337
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,960
The ones without the black dot means just the opposite.

338
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,460
That is, expense.

339
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,860
If you consider that the dates are focused

340
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:01,260
during the election time of last year,

341
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,060
-there is just one answer. -It can't be.

342
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,460
Under-the-counter accounting book of election campaign funds?

343
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:07,860
Exactly.

344
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,760
I have no idea how the chubby man

345
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,960
got a hold of the under-counter accounting book,

346
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:18,660
but there's probably no mistake that he was extorting money for this.

347
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:22,160
He probably put the copy of the accounting book into the cell phone

348
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,760
to show the one he was extorting that he really had the info.

349
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,760
Which means that the man is...

350
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:31,460
Most probably some man hired by Congressman Baisho,

351
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:35,360
who runs his election campaign car through this area.

352
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:37,460
-What? -He probably

353
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,660
wanted to get back the under-the-counter accounting book.

354
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:43,960
That man hung up part way calling the telephone company.

355
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:48,160
Because he heard the Shuhei Baisho's election car coming.

356
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:51,360
He didn't want people to think that anybody connected to Baisho

357
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,660
was searching for somebody who had information on the account book,

358
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,460
so he hung up without thinking.

359
00:17:56,461 --> 00:18:00,060
The one who chose this shop as the place to get the info,

360
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,460
is that man wearing sunglasses, who frequents this shop.

361
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,160
He was supposed to ring the cell phone here

362
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:08,160
and secretly get hold of the information

363
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,660
but the chubby man made a mistake!

364
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:15,860
But, I wonder why the chubby man didn't call our shop

365
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,360
after he realized he made a mistake?

366
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,060
Probably because he realized

367
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,660
only after the time he promised to ring the cell phone.

368
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,860
Because if it worked out the way it should have,

369
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:29,360
the chef of this shop was supposed to have found the cell phone

370
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:32,260
and the man wearing the sunglasses was supposed to come pick it up

371
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,960
as something he forgot.

372
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,960
Even if he went to the wrong shop, if he calls the cell phone,

373
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,260
the guys could come pick it up at Poirot.

374
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:45,460
But he didn't want the guys to hear his voice.

375
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:51,260
So, he probably carried everything out using faxes and e-mails,

376
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,060
because he didn't want the guys to get anything on him,

377
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:57,360
including his face and voice that would identify him.

378
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:59,360
That's why he even ended the contract with the cell phone company

379
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:02,960
and peeled off the product number.

380
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:07,460
Then why did the chubby man rush back to Poirot?

381
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:10,860
He wanted to confirm whether the man wearing the sunglasses

382
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,960
really got hold of the cell phone.

383
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:15,560
Because if someone picked it up and delivered it to the police,

384
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:18,760
his plans for getting cash would go down the drain.

385
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,560
But, under these circumstances,

386
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,560
that man wearing the sunglasses

387
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,260
would probably refuse to talk no matter what we ask him.

388
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,060
-Don't worry, there's still a way. -Huh?

389
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,660
Okay, Conan?

390
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,160
Yup!

391
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,460
Let's go, Azusa!

392
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,461
Huh?

393
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,261
-Hurry! -Conan?

394
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:42,060
Hey, Azusa! I wonder who forgot that cell phone.

395
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,660
If the owner can't be found, give it to me, okay?

396
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,560
This is the first time I've seen a cell phone

397
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,360
with such a strange pattern!

398
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:52,060
Huh? There are many strange names and letters in it!

399
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,160
Conan.

400
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,860
Hey you! Kid!

401
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,160
I mean, sonny.

402
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,560
You see, that's my phone.

403
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,960
What? Really?

404
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,560
Then, show me proof!

405
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,160
Proof?

406
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,460
Yup, if this is yours,

407
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:10,760
you should know the number of this cell phone, right?

408
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:14,260
I'll call it with my cell phone and see if it really works.

409
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,060
Will you give me the cell phone number?

410
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,260
Cut out the blabbering, hurry up and...

411
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,260
There's a policewoman!

412
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,160
I think I'll give this to that policewoman.

413
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,860
Hold it. Okay.

414
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:30,660
I'll give you the number now.

415
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:34,760
I got hold of the chubby man's phone number,

416
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:37,460
and from that number the police tracked down the apartment

417
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:39,460
where the chubby man lived.

418
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:43,260
The man seems to have been a journalist

419
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:45,160
and a copy of the under-the-counter account book

420
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,660
was found buried below a heap of receipts.

421
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:52,460
The names, dates and amount of cash were clearly written in it

422
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,860
and it was more than enough to serve as evidence.

423
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:57,460
All the people who received money from

424
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,960
or who were given money from Congressman Baisho

425
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,460
during the election campaign

426
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,661
were arrested, one after the other.

427
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,117
"Cafe Poirot."

428
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,717
Welcome!

429
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,817
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

430
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,917
A cup of hot coffee, please!

431
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:39,117
I'm an unknown detective that is fighting

432
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:41,517
with the dark aspects of society.

433
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:44,117
No, let me revise what I just said.

434
00:22:44,118 --> 00:22:47,817
I am Kogoro Mouri, a renown detective!

435
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,617
Hello!

436
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,717
Thank you so very much for yesterday.

437
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:55,717
If anything should ever come up again, make sure you tell me, okay?

438
00:22:55,718 --> 00:22:57,117
Yes, sir.

439
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:59,917
Yes, there is no case that I cannot solve.

440
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,817
Take for instance, that student.

441
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:03,717
He has successfully passed the university exam,

442
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:06,017
and doesn't have to come here to study anymore,

443
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,017
and yet he comes here frequently.

444
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:11,218
I'm sure that something else is blossoming inside him now.

445
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,418
A case!

446
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:17,117
Yes! This is Detective Mouri.

447
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:18,617
Hello, dad?

448
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:19,717
It's me.

449
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,417
Yup, what is it?

450
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,417
I think I'm going to be a bit late because of club practice today,

451
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:25,417
so could you go shopping for me?

452
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:28,017
Yes. Of course.

453
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:31,617
Potatoes.

454
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,117
Carrots, onions, pork, and apples!

455
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:36,817
Yep.

456
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,617
I figure we're going to be having curry tonight?

457
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,617
Bull's eye! Just as expected of a great detective!

458
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,917
Okay, got you! It sure is an important case!

459
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,917
I'll head off to the site immediately!

460
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,917
-Oh, no! -What's the matter, dad?

461
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:52,217
Hot, my coffee! My coffee!

462
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:55,318
Business sure is slow, eh, Pops?

463
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,117
During this season, I'm sure the bass

464
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:07,918
are waiting for bait in hiding at the shore side.

465
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:18,717
A person died there 6 months ago.

466
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,718
This is no coincidence!

467
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,817
Next Conan,

468
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:26,718
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 1)"

469
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:45,117
Next Conan's Hint:

470
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:46,817
"Trolley track."

471
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,417
Fishing? You caught nothing, right?

472
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:50,318
Well, it's way better than

473
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,918
not fishing at all and just holding buckets.
