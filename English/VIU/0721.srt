1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:03,292
We, who came to an Aso, Kumamoto sightseeing tour,

2
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,192
got involved in a case in which

3
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:06,892
the confidential data of Kumamon Foods was stolen

4
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:10,692
and an amount of 10,000,000 yen was being demanded.

5
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:13,792
The culprit had hidden the USB memory stick

6
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,392
with the confidential data inside it

7
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:18,392
into the Kumamon stuffed doll,

8
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,592
but from a queer turn of fate,

9
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:23,992
that doll falls into the hands of Justin, who we ran into on our tour.

10
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,892
Going on the words that Justin had left behind as clues,

11
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:31,992
we somehow managed to find him.

12
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:36,292
But right after that, to our surprise Justin is kidnapped,

13
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:39,892
stuffed doll and all, by the culprit right before our eyes!

14
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:43,892
Is there a spy accomplice to the culprit among us?

15
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:47,492
And who on earth is the culprit?

16
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,692
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:04,492
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,292
The mystery gathers at Kumamoto Castle.

19
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:08,492
The mystery involving the USB memory stick is disclosed.

20
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:10,092
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:11,892
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:14,192
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:48,902
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Kumamoto Edition)"

24
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:54,402
After that, we got no demands from the culprit

25
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:58,202
and stayed overnight at a hotel in Kumamoto City.

26
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:02,602
It sort of turned out to be a strange trip!

27
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:07,202
-What? -Hey, Genta!

28
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:08,402
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:11,002
No, that's not what I meant!

30
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,802
It's not your fault, Ayumi!

31
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,202
So saying she'd be bothered about it either way, right?

32
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,602
Yeah.

33
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,602
Mr. Mouri!

34
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,202
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

35
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:26,302
Did you get a call from the culprit or something?

36
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:29,902
Yes, sir. Kumamon Foods got a call

37
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,202
from the culprit telling them to bring 10,000,000 yen to Kumamoto City.

38
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,402
Therefore, Mr. Kumada and the others have come here

39
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:37,802
and are gathered in the conference room.

40
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,902
Okay.

41
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,802
Ran, take care of the children, will you?

42
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,702
Yep.

43
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:48,002
Huh? Conan?

44
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,502
I'll go look for him.

45
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,502
Okay, please do.

46
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:08,702
Yes. I'm with the people from the police right now.

47
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:11,102
What on earth shall I do?

48
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,102
-Here. -Thank you.

49
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,002
A child's been kidnapped?

50
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:27,002
What on earth are the police doing anyway?

51
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,802
We're very sorry.

52
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:33,302
Did the culprit specify the site of the deal?

53
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,602
No, he just said he'd get a hold of me later.

54
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:40,302
Why would a mere data of the company being stolen

55
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,402
turn into a kidnap case?

56
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,802
Hey, Inoue!

57
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,702
Just what do you mean by "mere data of the company being stolen"?

58
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,902
I'm sure you know how important that data is

59
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:51,702
to our company too, don't you?

60
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:53,002
But being the situation it is now,

61
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,902
the child's life is above all priority, right?

62
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:58,102
What? You dare stand against me or what?

63
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:02,402
Well, well, let's not get all heated up.

64
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,002
For the time being,

65
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,702
let's wait for the next call from the culprit.

66
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,102
What's this?

67
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,702
Feeling of something not being right.

68
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,702
The child's life is more important than the data...

69
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,602
That's true, but...

70
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,102
Conan.

71
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,302
Ai. Don't scare me like that.

72
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:24,502
I want a word with you.

73
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,702
"Kumamoto Ramen shop"

74
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,802
Three orders of Kumamoto ramen, please!

75
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:38,202
Why do you want to take my Kumamon?

76
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,702
Come on, tell me.

77
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,002
Shut up and eat.

78
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:51,102
No! Don't!

79
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,402
This is Justin's!

80
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,102
Just what're you doing to mommy?

81
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,302
I'm going to turn anybody

82
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,802
that does something bad to mommy to the police!

83
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,202
Name card?

84
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:05,802
Right, probably her husband's.

85
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,002
The name "Naoto Takamori" was written on it, you see.

86
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:11,102
Then, Jessica was placing a call to her husband?

87
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,802
But, wouldn't she normally have her husband's number

88
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,802
registered in her cell phone?

89
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,102
I don't know why,

90
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:20,902
but that name card was of Higo Foods.

91
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,402
Higo Foods?

92
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:24,102
If I remember correctly, wasn't that...

93
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,902
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

94
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:31,602
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

95
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:34,202
we're finished!

96
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,802
Justin's father is the president of Higo Foods.

97
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:40,302
Could this be a mere coincidence?

98
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,002
Or...

99
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:46,602
Hey!

100
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:48,502
Where are you guys going?

101
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:53,202
We managed to make it through without Ran seeing us, you see.

102
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:55,302
Just what do you think you're doing?

103
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:56,302
Come on, let's go!

104
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:58,402
So, where are we going?

105
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,402
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

106
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,702
are going to go look for Justin!

107
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,702
That's dangerous.

108
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,602
Oh, no! He caught us in the act.

109
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,702
That wound on your arm...

110
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:13,402
You got hurt when an accomplice of the culprit

111
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,602
hit you with the bag he had, didn't you?

112
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,402
But next time, maybe you won't get away

113
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,302
with just getting hurt, you know?

114
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:26,502
Were you there back then, Mr. Inoue?

115
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:29,302
President, did you call for me?

116
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,302
You're late, Inoue!

117
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:32,502
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,902
But why are the police here?

119
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,602
If I remember correctly, didn't you come here

120
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:39,402
after the president called for you?

121
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,502
I heard about it from the president,

122
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,002
that a girl called Ayumi got hurt.

123
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,002
You're Ayumi, aren't you?

124
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,502
Yes, sir. But I'm to blame.

125
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,702
Because I interfered.

126
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:59,202
If you so insist, I'll go with you.

127
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,602
After all to begin with, our company is to blame

128
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:04,002
for getting our confidential data stolen.

129
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:13,302
During the 2nd call from the culprit,

130
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:16,102
I heard the sound of a tram in the background.

131
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:20,202
But there are two tram lines in Kumamoto,

132
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:24,802
with a total of 35 tam stops.

133
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:27,102
With only that much to go on...

134
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:30,902
"Found lost stamp book"

135
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,602
That's...

136
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,602
It's this.

137
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:37,802
No doubt about it. This is Justin's stamp book!

138
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:40,002
He deliberately left it behind a while ago,

139
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,302
to let us know his whereabouts, right?

140
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:45,202
Was he with someone else?

141
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:48,002
The thing is... He was with a suspicious looking man

142
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,902
who was wearing sunglasses and a mask.

143
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:53,402
I wonder if that was his father?

144
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:56,902
Which means he's still with the culprit.

145
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:00,202
And, would you have any idea which way they went?

146
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,302
If I remember correctly, it was...

147
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,102
"Shimotori Arcade" -They walked through the arcade

148
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,102
and went toward the castle.

149
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,402
Oh, no. She found out.

150
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,502
Hello, Ran?

151
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,602
Hey, Conan. Where are you?

152
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:16,702
Is everyone else with you too?

153
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,302
Just what do you brats think you're doing, going off on your own?

154
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,002
We're not only going around on our own.

155
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:23,002
Mr. Inoue's here with us, too.

156
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:24,302
What?

157
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,502
-I don't care who you're with. -That American-Japanese boy

158
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,102
that we just saw was really cute, wasn't he?

159
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,902
-You can say that again! -That's why brats like you guys...

160
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,202
Excuse me!

161
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:37,102
The American-Japanese boy, what kind of a boy was he?

162
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,902
It's him.

163
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,502
It's Justin, after all!

164
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,602
Where did you take this picture?

165
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:44,802
A little ways ahead.

166
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,502
Just about in front of the Karaoke shop.

167
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:50,202
I see.

168
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,602
He's not here.

169
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,802
Maybe he already left to go elsewhere?

170
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,902
Excuse me.

171
00:09:56,902 --> 00:10:01,802
Didn't you see an American-Japanese boy about our age?

172
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,302
-We did! -We did!

173
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,902
We saw him around that convenience store over there.

174
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:08,602
He even winked at me, you know!

175
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,202
He was awesome!

176
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,802
Is he a child model?

177
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:13,102
Just as expected.

178
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:14,602
Yeah.

179
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:17,202
He's doing all this deliberately

180
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:20,302
to let us know where he is.

181
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,402
He's pretty sly.

182
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:23,852
"Bronze statue of Seishoko"

183
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:26,852
Hey, look, look. Take a look at him!

184
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:29,252
He's so cute!

185
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,752
He's so adult-like.

186
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,452
My, he's cute!

187
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:33,852
Really!

188
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,452
Awesome!

189
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,752
Just what do you think you're doing, brat?

190
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,052
We're standing out too much!

191
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:47,452
"Josai Garden"

192
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:52,552
Stay still and play over here.

193
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,352
Don't you dare do anything funny.

194
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,252
I'm keeping my eyes on you, understand?

195
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,052
Okay.

196
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,352
Did you get the money ready?

197
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,052
Yeah! It's right here!

198
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:09,352
Listen well.

199
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,352
Put the bag of money

200
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,452
under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle!

201
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,352
If I even get a glimpse of the police,

202
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,552
I won't guarantee the child's life, get that?

203
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,752
I'm sure that they'll...

204
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:26,252
Let me go! What do you think you're doing?

205
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:30,952
Watch out!

206
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,452
I'm sure that they'll...

207
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,052
Kumamoto Castle?

208
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,452
I was told to put the bag with the money

209
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,452
inside under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle.

210
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:51,052
This'll probably be our last chance.

211
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:54,352
We've got to nab the culprit no matter what, this time!

212
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:57,952
But if the culprit was where we goofed on the previous deal

213
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:00,352
and watching from close range,

214
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,752
there's a possibility that all of our faces have been seen.

215
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:04,852
Yeah.

216
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:08,652
If he finds out that we're keeping watch from close by,

217
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,052
the child's life will be endangered.

218
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,952
I've got one!

219
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,752
An idea!

220
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:19,052
Why not let I, Kogoro Mouri take care of this?

221
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,652
Hey, wait. Are you going to be all right, dad?

222
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:28,052
I hope you find your friend soon.

223
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,552
Thank you.

224
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,452
Like the woman at the ramen shop was saying a while ago...

225
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:36,252
Could the kidnaper of the child be his father?

226
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:39,052
The kidnapper of the child?

227
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,952
Conan!

228
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:44,652
There was a person who saw Justin at Wakuwaku-za!

229
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:46,052
Wakuwaku-za?

230
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,652
Where are we headed for next?

231
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,152
Shut up and come with me!

232
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,952
There he is!

233
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,452
The kidnapper's with him, too!

234
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,552
He's not getting away!

235
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,352
What took you guys so long?

236
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,252
Stay away!

237
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:10,352
Don't move! Or else, I'll...

238
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:16,452
Darn! Hold it!

239
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,252
Pass!

240
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:22,452
Give it to me!

241
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,152
Conan!

242
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:32,152
You brats!

243
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,452
Ai!

244
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:35,952
No, I'll get it!

245
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,352
Stay out of my way!

246
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,852
Too bad!

247
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,452
Darn it!

248
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:00,752
Leave the rest to me and go after the culprit, Conan!

249
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,952
Okay, I'm counting on you, Ai!

250
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,652
"Kumamoto Castle"

251
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:12,652
"Honmaru Goten"

252
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,752
All of you!

253
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:32,052
Intruder! Nab him!

254
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:34,852
Aye...

255
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:44,952
I'm the boss of this castle!

256
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,552
One word from me and this is what you get!

257
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,752
Officer Kosugi helped you out by showing his police badge, didn't he?

258
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:53,952
Darn it!

259
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:57,252
Don't you care what happens to the kid or what?

260
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,852
He's only bluffing!

261
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:03,352
I'm over here!

262
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,352
Justin!

263
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,852
Mommy!

264
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,252
Darn it!

265
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,652
That voice...

266
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:16,352
You're Mr. Koda, aren't you?

267
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,452
Don't!

268
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,352
Koda?

269
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:24,252
I received mail from you saying that you wanted me to contact you

270
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:26,052
when we figured out Justin's whereabouts and so I did.

271
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:30,352
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

272
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:34,652
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

273
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:37,152
Mt. Daikanbo?

274
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:38,152
I see!

275
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:40,752
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

276
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:43,452
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

277
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,952
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

278
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,252
That's...

279
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:49,352
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

280
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:52,052
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

281
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,852
I've got to let Mr. Koda know!

282
00:15:56,652 --> 00:16:00,352
I had no idea that you were up to something like this.

283
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:02,852
I needed money!

284
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:05,152
I lost a great deal of money gambling

285
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,852
and had a large debt borrowing from a loan shark.

286
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:10,152
I had to make ends meet!

287
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,752
I was stabbed with a knife

288
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:13,652
saying that they won't be lenient with me just because I'm a cop.

289
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,152
They threatened me saying that the next time around,

290
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:16,452
they won't spare my life.

291
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:19,952
So that's the truth of why you were stabbed by a thug.

292
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,652
Who's the culprit?

293
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,852
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

294
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:30,052
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

295
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,052
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

296
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,352
Who cares which it is!

297
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,852
You're the officer who went after the man that fled back then.

298
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:41,252
I get it. Everything's clear now!

299
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,352
Ai, can you hear me?

300
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:47,152
Why'd you dare rob our company?

301
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:49,652
How'd you know about the confidential data?

302
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:53,352
Maybe somebody else stole it.

303
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,952
Because on the day that Kumamon Foods was robbed,

304
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:00,152
Mr. Koda was still hospitalized, right?

305
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:06,052
Then where's the confidential data for the new product?

306
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,752
Where'd my Kumamon go?

307
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,352
As to that, we know where it is.

308
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:15,252
Come with me!

309
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,052
I found it!

310
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,752
Really, Ayumi?

311
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:22,952
See. The memory stick is intact right here, too!

312
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,452
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,052
Well done, Ayumi!

314
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,752
You did it!

315
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:31,352
Thank you! You've saved our company!

316
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,352
Yep! Here you go!

317
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:37,052
No! Don't give it to him yet.

318
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:39,052
Just what do you...

319
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,152
The great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

320
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,752
Off I go!

321
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,352
Dad?

322
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,752
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

323
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:05,052
Mr. Inoue, I have a question I'd like to ask you.

324
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,552
What could it be?

325
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:11,452
Isn't this case something you yourself planned and acted out?

326
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:18,152
Just what do you mean by that?

327
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:21,452
I'm asking you whether you're the one

328
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:26,352
who stole the confidential data of Kumamon Foods, Mr. Inoue.

329
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,852
Just what do you think you're saying?

330
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,552
I heard from Conan

331
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:34,052
that you weren't at Cuddly Dominion,

332
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:36,352
the site of the deal yesterday.

333
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:42,152
And yet you knew about the culprit throwing the bag at her.

334
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,752
You seem to have said that

335
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,852
you heard about this from President Kumada?

336
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,752
However, President Kumada had mistakenly thought that

337
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:54,452
Ayumi Yoshida was Ai Haibara,

338
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,752
and remembered one for the other.

339
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,252
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

340
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,252
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

341
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:06,252
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

342
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,652
Who cares which it is!

343
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:12,452
That's why if you really heard about it from President Kumada,

344
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,952
you would have heard, "A girl named Ai got hit

345
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:16,752
by the bag the culprit threw at her."

346
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:19,352
But you asked not Ai Haibara,

347
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:22,452
but Ayumi Yoshida whether she was okay.

348
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,852
That's because back then...

349
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,752
You were also at the scene of the crime!

350
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,652
To get the money that the executer of the crime

351
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:38,252
was supposed to give you.

352
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:41,352
But the plan failed!

353
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,052
Since you were urgently called

354
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:46,052
by President Kumada to explain the situation,

355
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,152
you made it look as if you rushed over just now

356
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,852
and appeared before us.

357
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:54,952
Isn't that right?

358
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:58,852
I don't remember telling you anything like that!

359
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,252
It's true that on that day

360
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,752
I was at the scene where the deal took place.

361
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,652
I admit that.

362
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:08,052
But that's only because I was concerned about the deal!

363
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,252
If you so insist...

364
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,852
Officer Kosugi!

365
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:16,452
You have a USB port on your tablet, don't you?

366
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:19,152
Yes, there is.

367
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,452
Then, you can confirm right now

368
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:25,052
what's inside the USB memory stick that was retrieved, can't you?

369
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:27,152
Well, not really.

370
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,552
What's wrong?

371
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,952
If that's really the data that was stolen,

372
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:33,552
wouldn't you be able to view it right now?

373
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:36,052
If it's confidential,

374
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:39,652
I don't mind you showing it only to President Kumada, you know.

375
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:42,652
How about it, Inoue?

376
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,852
Be it something that you planned and acted out yourself,

377
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:48,652
you couldn't bring yourself to steal the real data.

378
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,052
In other words,

379
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:54,052
confidential data was never stolen to begin with!

380
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:03,552
I couldn't stand the president's overbearing

381
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,852
and haughty attitude towards me,

382
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,052
treating me like his henchman.

383
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:10,852
So, all I wanted to do was give him a little trouble.

384
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,252
But the police turns up

385
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:16,952
and partway it switches to a real kidnap case.

386
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,052
Since gradually start getting more and more serious,

387
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:22,352
I couldn't make myself come out and tell the truth anymore.

388
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:54,552
"Hosokawa Gyobu Mansion"

389
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:01,852
It seems that Justin's father had already passed away.

390
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:05,352
It seems that the phone call that Jessica was making

391
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:09,852
was to discuss the case with a colleague of her father.

392
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:16,352
That's why his name wasn't registered

393
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:17,952
and she was looking at the name card.

394
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,952
Now I understand why Justin was trying to protect his mother

395
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:22,452
anytime something came up.

396
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:27,352
He probably felt like he had to do his father's share, too.

397
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,752
Yeah. Because after all to him...

398
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:35,952
Mommy is number one.

399
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,452
"Next Episode" -I'll never forgive you if you leave now!

400
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,352
Ai.

401
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:46,352
They're important witnesses.

402
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,352
Don't get chicken!

403
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:51,552
He could never make a sound!

404
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,552
Can't make a sound?

405
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:57,952
Wait a sec.

406
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,852
If I remember correctly, this cat...

407
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:03,252
I see! There's one other way.

408
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:08,652
