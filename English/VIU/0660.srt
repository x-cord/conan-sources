1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:03,738
The serial car thefts

2
00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:08,163
that Yumi of the Metropolitan Police Department had named as such,

3
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:10,763
was a malicious case in which the key was tampered with,

4
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:13,363
the car then broken into and the word "Die" was written

5
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,963
on the ceiling of the car.

6
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:18,263
Officer Chiba's car was also attacked,

7
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:22,363
and the new policewoman, Naeko Miike, who came along with Yumi

8
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,663
after they were contacted about the incident,

9
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:26,563
turned out to be Officer Chiba's first love.

10
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,963
There was a time when we looked for

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,863
a video that she was shown on at Teitan Elementary School,

12
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:36,363
together with Officer Chiba in the past.

13
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:40,063
It seems that Officer Chiba was totally oblivious to the fact

14
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,763
that the woman officer in front of him was his first love.

15
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:47,363
So, we thought up a plan to make Officer Chiba and Naeko

16
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,463
investigate the car theft case together.

17
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:52,363
If they both work together,

18
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,863
he would most likely remember her.

19
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:58,763
But, in the basement parking lot that they were investigating,

20
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:00,763
there was a car collision.

21
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:04,263
Moreover, the word "Die" was written with red spray paint

22
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,863
on the inside of the windshield of the car that was hit.

23
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:11,863
Don't tell me that this was also the work of the serial car thief.

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,463
Three people were in the parking lot at the time the accident happened.

25
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:17,963
The person who was driving the car that was hit,

26
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:20,663
Mr. Akitoshi Fukuchi, an office worker.

27
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:25,063
Mrs. Noriko Shigei, a housewife who was driving the car that collided,

28
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:29,963
and free-lancer, Mr. Takero Nawa who was waiting for his friend to come.

29
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:32,663
Is the car thief and person who caused the collision

30
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,263
among the three?

31
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:57,263
If all cases were men,

32
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,163
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:00,863
The culprit and your first lover.

34
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,863
You've got two things to figure out, Officer Chiba.

35
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:04,463
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,463
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,363
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,092
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 2)".

39
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,261
I'd like to make a declaration.

40
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:46,861
As a result of careful investigation...

41
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:50,861
There was no one other than you three, after all!

42
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:54,861
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

43
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,061
No.

44
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:58,361
Why am I, who was hit from behind

45
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,361
also included as one of the suspects?

46
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,961
Why not?

47
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,261
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

48
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:08,261
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

49
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,561
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -Give me a break!

50
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:13,561
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

51
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,661
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -Same here,

52
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,761
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

53
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,461
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -I got to hurry home too,

54
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,161
or my parents will get on my back.

55
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,661
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

56
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:27,361
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

57
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,261
And, they didn't say anything

58
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,261
about that flashy wing on your car?

59
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:35,061
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

60
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:38,161
No, they haven't seen it.

61
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,761
Come to think of it,

62
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,761
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

63
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,161
Yes.

64
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,561
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

65
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,061
I wonder why.

66
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,361
How should I know?

67
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:57,161
The wing on your car is much flashier

68
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,661
and the position of the wing is higher too.

69
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:03,461
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

70
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,261
maybe you'll find something more.

71
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,361
If so,

72
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:09,161
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

73
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,861
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

74
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,961
I'll go get it then!

75
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,361
Thank you!

76
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:19,161
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

77
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,161
Why?

78
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:21,761
If there are a lot of pictures,

79
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,561
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

80
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,961
It's the duty of men to help women!

81
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,661
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

82
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:04,961
What's with you guys staring into each other's eyes

83
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,861
like in some romantic move?

84
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,261
Go on,

85
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,361
hurry and go take pictures.

86
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,661
Yes!

87
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,361
I wish you wouldn't go giving the eye to new-comers.

88
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:20,661
Giving the eye?

89
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:24,661
I think it's best that we explain things to her.

90
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,861
You can say that again.

91
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,161
Oh, boy.

92
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,861
What? You mean they're each other's first love

93
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,461
and are still in love with each other,

94
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,261
but Officer Chiba still isn't aware who she is?

95
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,161
Are you serious?

96
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,161
Yep!

97
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,761
Hold it.

98
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,061
Miwako and Officer Takagi...

99
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:48,361
Then, there are Officer Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi, the teacher.

100
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:49,561
On top of that...

101
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:54,461
if those two get it on well...

102
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,361
Bye, Yumi.

103
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,761
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:02,361
See you.

105
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:06,461
I've got to stop them.

106
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,061
It's true that there are pictures taken from various angles.

107
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,161
But, including my car, I can't think of anything

108
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,761
that the cars that have been victimized have in common.

109
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,761
Don't tell me, she's asking about the mileage of my car?

110
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,361
I wonder what it was.

111
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:25,561
Don't you remember?

112
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,661
No, I don't remember.

113
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,861
I thought so.

114
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:35,461
Huh? I wonder if I voiced anything about the mileage?

115
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,861
Stupid.

116
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:41,361
So, let's hurry and go show the pictures to Conan!

117
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,761
He may come up with some interesting ideas again, you see!

118
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:48,061
She's obviously deliberately getting in the way.

119
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,961
It seems everything worked out the opposite of what was planned.

120
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,561
True.

121
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,361
Although the position of the wing is lower than that of Mr. Nawa's car...

122
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,261
I wonder why the car was attacked.

123
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,261
This is the second car that was vandalized, wasn't it?

124
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,261
Yes. It's the car of an officer worker

125
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,861
who was on his way home from golf.

126
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,561
There seems to be a lot of golf bags in the car.

127
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,961
It seems he had the golf bags of his friends inside too.

128
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:18,961
Wait a sec.

129
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,661
Could this be...

130
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,261
Hey, wasn't there any accidents near here

131
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,961
where a child was involved recently?

132
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,661
Yes, there was, last month.

133
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:38,761
The car that caused the accident

134
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,261
belonged to a high school teacher.

135
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,461
I heard that the driver completely admitted it to be his/her fault

136
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,861
and the case was settled out of court.

137
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,061
What kind of car was it?

138
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,061
An ordinary station wagon.

139
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,361
It seems that the family was on their way to the beach.

140
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,361
They seem to have had

141
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:59,361
a lot of floats, beach balls, rubber boats and etc. loaded in their car.

142
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,461
There's no mistake about it.

143
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,961
The culprit is the person trying to force open

144
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:09,061
the eyes of the person whose eyes are closed.

145
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,161
And, so, Conan?

146
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:19,061
Have you figured something out from looking at that picture?

147
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:21,261
Huh? About what?

148
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,161
So!

149
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,661
Anything about serial car thief that sprayed the word "Die"

150
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:28,261
on the windshield with red spray paint,

151
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:30,761
who tried to make it off on that car,

152
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:36,761
but couldn't because she crashed into the car in front!

153
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:40,761
Moreover, since we closed off this parking lot after that accident,

154
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:43,361
the people who were here back then was

155
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:46,761
Mr. Fukuchi who was in his car that is said to have been hit from behind,

156
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,961
Mrs. Shigei, the owner of the car that was vandalized,

157
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,961
as well as the very car that hit Mr. Fukuchi's car

158
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:57,361
and Mr. Nawa who claims that he was waiting for his friend to show up.

159
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:01,761
So, Conan? Who of the three is the car thief?

160
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,661
Beats me.

161
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,161
I'm just a child, you know.

162
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,661
Don't tell me that you're not telling me despite knowing who it is.

163
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,661
Hey, Yumi...

164
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,361
The department store is asking

165
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:18,161
if they can start letting the customers into the parking lot already.

166
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:21,361
We've got no choice, let them in.

167
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,361
Okay, I guess we get to go too, don't we?

168
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:27,461
No! Because the culprit is among one of you three!

169
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,061
Then, why don't we do this?

170
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,061
Let's have the three come to the police station for now

171
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,661
and have them give their names, address,

172
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:38,661
as well as the reason why they're here and all the details to you, Yumi.

173
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:40,961
As for Officer Chiba's car

174
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,361
that was vandalized before the other cars were,

175
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:47,161
how about having the other policewoman take charge?

176
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,561
I guess so.

177
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,861
The young should work together.

178
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,261
Great idea, I guess.

179
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,661
I agree!

180
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:55,561
Yep, yep!

181
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,661
Well...

182
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:00,561
since I'm off duty, it doesn't bother me.

183
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,861
It... it really doesn't bother me either.

184
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,661
No way!

185
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,461
You belong to the second department

186
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:08,061
of violent crime investigations third division, don't you?

187
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:10,061
So you should be going after murderers!

188
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,161
But, you told me to cooperate with you just a while ago.

189
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,361
A while ago is a while ago, and now is now!

190
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,161
What?

191
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,161
She's getting in the way again.

192
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,261
Yep.

193
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,761
You go tell the department store to open up the parking lot.

194
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:23,861
Yes!

195
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:26,561
You go on home, Officer Chiba because you're just getting in the way!

196
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,261
Getting in the way?

197
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:31,061
Hey, do you have any acquaintances

198
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:34,061
that would print Ita cars, Officer Chiba?

199
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,561
I do.

200
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,061
How soon can it be printed?

201
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:41,061
Well, it's like a seal, so...

202
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,261
If it's just an ordinary character in stock

203
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,461
and only to be printed on one side,

204
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:45,561
I think it can be completed in two or three hours.

205
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,861
If so...

206
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:50,361
-What's this about? -Tell me about it too.

207
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,461
-Me too. -Tell me too!

208
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,261
Yes. It's okay to let the customers in,

209
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:58,061
but please inform them that they must avoid and go around

210
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,461
the scene of the accident.

211
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,761
I informed the department store.

212
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:07,261
Then, have the three come to the police station

213
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,161
and let's start interrogating them separately.

214
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,061
I think two or three hours...

215
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,561
That will do.

216
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,159
Hey, Takagi.

217
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,559
Have you seen my car key?

218
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,659
Oh, that...

219
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,259
Yumi took it with her a while ago.

220
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,859
Yumi did?

221
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,859
She said, "We'll do a little decorating, give me a sec".

222
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,459
Decorating?

223
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,759
Don't tell me, not again...

224
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,959
She's planning to stick on those weird stickers!

225
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,159
Stickers?

226
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,259
The ones that look like the green beginner driver stickers.

227
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,559
The ones that say, "Beginner lover's driving"!

228
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,059
I didn't realize that the sticker was on my car last time

229
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,859
and went to a murder site with it on

230
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:04,659
and was embarrassed to no end, you see!

231
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:09,059
Well, if they're magnet type or suction type stickers,

232
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,959
like the beginner driver stickers,

233
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
they can be removed easily.

234
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,359
Yes. That's it!

235
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,859
No more, because if you continue,

236
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:15,159
Miwako will get angry.

237
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,159
We've finally figured out

238
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,159
what the cars that were attacked had in common.

239
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,959
The first car was an Ita car.

240
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,759
The second car was loaded with golf bags.

241
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,959
The third car had wings.

242
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,559
The fourth one had toy boxes lined out.

243
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,459
And the Ita character that was decorated on the FD car.

244
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,759
The cars that were attacked

245
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,459
all had their rear windows blocked with something!

246
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:49,459
That's why you didn't attack Mr. Nawa's hot rod, right?

247
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,959
A flashy wing was attached,

248
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,859
but the position of the wing was low

249
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,859
and the rear window wasn't blocked off.

250
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,659
So on the other hand, stuffed dolls were lined out

251
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:02,359
blocking the entire rear window of Mr. Fukuchi's car.

252
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,559
Just when the car was about to start off,

253
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,459
you saw this from the driver's seat of your car

254
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,659
and inadvertently crashed your car into someone else's car.

255
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,559
That's right, isn't it?

256
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,959
Mrs. Noriko Shigiei!

257
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,659
After the collision,

258
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,459
you snapped back to yourself

259
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,759
and in order to make it through back then...

260
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,359
you used the spray that you had in your car

261
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,759
to write the word "Die"

262
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,059
to make it look as if the car thief had done it!

263
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,459
You figured that nobody would mentally suspect

264
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:36,459
that a car thief would vandalize his own car,

265
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,859
and you took advantage of this.

266
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,059
Is there something wrong in what I'm saying?

267
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,359
No use trying to flee!

268
00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:00,959
This entire area has been completely surrounded by the police

269
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,859
while you were going through interrogation.

270
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,359
Yes.

271
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,159
This place is near your house

272
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,159
and on the way to the station.

273
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,159
In other words,

274
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,059
we were staking you out thinking that you, after seeing this Ita car

275
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,959
would return home to get the spray and tools necessary

276
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,859
to force open the key and return to the site.

277
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:22,459
Well, since tonight's strategy of using the FD was a trap set by us,

278
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,059
we'll overlook this, but...

279
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,259
as for the other things, spit it out, will you?

280
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,659
You did all this

281
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,659
for your son who died of a traffic accident last month, right?

282
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,359
The cause of the accident was careless safety confirmation.

283
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:42,659
Because the car was full of floats and rubber boats,

284
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,159
the view from the rearview mirror was blocked.

285
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,359
And, since you,

286
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:49,459
who unfortunately was behind that car pushing a stroller along,

287
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,659
wasn't in view of the driver,

288
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:56,859
you decided to attack all the impudent cars

289
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,659
with blocked rear view vision

290
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:02,859
to give them a taste of their own medicine.

291
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,759
But what a sad case

292
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,359
that the victim of an unfair accidental crime,

293
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,059
commits a crime in turn and becomes the criminal.

294
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,759
Yes.

295
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,459
The regulation concerning rear windows is ambiguous

296
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,959
and there are no laws to really enforce them yet.

297
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,359
But, Conan,

298
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,759
it's amazing

299
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,659
how you figured out that Mrs. Shigei lost her child.

300
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,659
It's the discolored part in the backseat of Mrs. Shigei's car.

301
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,659
I realized it when I saw the car in the parking lot.

302
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,159
It's discolored because a child seat was there, right?

303
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,959
If the car was newly bought only last year

304
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,859
and that seat is already discolored,

305
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,559
it means that she had a child till last year, right?

306
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,759
But, it may have been removed because the child already grew up.

307
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,159
If the child needs a child seat,

308
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,659
he has to be younger than us.

309
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,059
So, if she were held back for interrogation as long as she was,

310
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,959
she would've naturally gotten worried about her child, right?

311
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,959
Come to think of it, that person...

312
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,659
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

313
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,359
She was only worried about her husband's dinner.

314
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,559
Right, right! The man said that his daughter was waiting, though.

315
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,359
I see! That's why she got a little angry when I asked

316
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,859
if there were any toys or things in the car.

317
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,559
Yep, because she had no need for things like that.

318
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,959
But, how'd you know

319
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:41,859
that the man had many dolls lined out in the back of his car?

320
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,159
Right,

321
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,259
although we could see that a lot was on the backseat of the car...

322
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,559
That man was saying, right?

323
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,359
That his daughter usually lines them out nicely so the view is not blocked.

324
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,359
In order to do so,

325
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,659
she has no choice but to line them out

326
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:59,459
on the rear window of the backseat, which is behind her head.

327
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,059
I see,

328
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,259
that's why she impulsively hit her own car.

329
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:06,259
She couldn't have possibly

330
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,659
gone into someone else's car while someone was inside it

331
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,759
and write the word "Die".

332
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,459
Right.

333
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,459
She may have wanted to expand the driver's view,

334
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:18,459
if she couldn't warn him by words.

335
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,559
The stuffed dolls would fall with the impact of the collision too.

336
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,459
But, unlike the other cars,

337
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,459
why was only the windshield of that car sprayed with red paint?

338
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:31,759
All the other cars had the word written on the ceiling inside, right?

339
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,359
Lipstick!

340
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,359
Her face was buried in the airbag that was ejected by the impact

341
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,659
and her lipstick got on it,

342
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,259
so she probably hid it with the same color red spray.

343
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,759
I think she tried to make it look as if

344
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,359
the red spray paint word on the windshield got onto the airbag.

345
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,459
Well, if lipstick is on it,

346
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,759
then saliva should also be there,

347
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,259
so we could've come up with the culprit by a DNA test.

348
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,859
Then, it wouldn't have been necessary to set a trap.

349
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:01,159
No, we did the right thing.

350
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,159
We couldn't let her go any further.

351
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,159
We don't want her to commit anymore sad crimes like this.

352
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,859
Then, Yumi!

353
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,359
I'll be leaving.

354
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,959
I may do some interrogation later,

355
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,359
so see you then!

356
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,359
I guess I'll inform Miwako who I borrowed the car from then.

357
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,259
See you, Officer Chiba!

358
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,259
Yeah!

359
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,359
That's right, I...

360
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,059
I've got to go back to the station on Miwako's FD,

361
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,659
so will you take care of our mini police car for me?

362
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,059
Yes!

363
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,959
Well, since you're at it,

364
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,659
why not give Officer Chiba a ride home?

365
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:55,859
Yes!

366
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,459
I feel like I'm being escorted off or something.

367
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,959
I feel nervous.

368
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,359
This is the first time I ever rode a mini police car, you see.

369
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,959
Is that right?

370
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,259
But...

371
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,059
I can't help feeling that this isn't the first time.

372
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,659
That I'm seeing you.

373
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:22,959
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...

374
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:26,159
could you by chance be...

375
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,059
Yes?

376
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,459
Could you by chance be...

377
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,259
Yes.

378
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,459
The officer that gave me a parking ticket at Haido-cho the other day?

379
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,359
Yes.

380
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,459
I was transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department last month.

381
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,959
Just as I thought!

382
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,359
I was sure that I met you somewhere!

383
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,659
I see!

384
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,159
It seems as if Officer Chiba is not aware of anything.

385
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,459
-What? -What?

386
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,259
No kidding?

387
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:23,459
After Yumi tried to give them a chance...

388
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,559
Really.

389
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,059
It was like throwing pearls before swine after all.

390
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,659
Hey, hey.

391
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,959
Maybe it's better to say it's like preaching to deaf ears.

392
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,659
It can't be.

393
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,959
Hey!

394
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,559
What is this?

395
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,759
Please don't get mad at me.

396
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,659
"Next Episode" -Mr. Kogoro Mouri is a very very good person!

397
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:07,459
Yes...

398
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,359
Who are you?

399
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,359
Don't worry!

400
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,759
The case will be solved immediately!

401
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,059
We've got the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri on our side!

402
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,659
Hey, hey.

403
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,059
Next Conan,

404
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,859
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 1)".

405
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,459
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,759
"Key".

407
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,459
In the next episode, Pops will play the good man.

408
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,959
-No darn way. -True.

409
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,359
I guess so.
