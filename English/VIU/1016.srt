1
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:44,557
Hey!

2
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:47,427
What happened? Are you all right?

3
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,136
It hurts... It hurts...

4
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,637
Am I going to die?

5
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,977
You'll be fine, as long as we can stop the bleeding.

6
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:56,517
What's this?

7
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:04,187
Excuse me, could I borrow your scarf?

8
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:06,407
Sure.

9
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,037
Mister, should we press the emergency stop button?

10
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:13,937
Yeah.

11
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:30,796
What's the matter? Did something happen?

12
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:31,937
Someone's injured.

13
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,206
A passenger has been wounded.

14
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,417
Call the police and an ambulance.

15
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:39,286
Hurry it up! Now!

16
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,567
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,376
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

18
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:54,706
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

19
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:56,656
Bullets fly into a moving train!

20
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,417
Track down the sniper who disappeared!

21
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,546
Always determining the one truth

22
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:02,296
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

23
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:05,137
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,697
"The Monorail Sniper Case, Part One!"

25
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,316
Is everyone all right? Where's the injured person?

26
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:10,257
We're fine. We stopped the bleeding. He's sitting inside.

27
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,776
Mister, let's find the culprit quickly.

28
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,887
You don't have to tell me twice.

29
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:18,156
Whoops. Preserving the crime scene is our top priority.

30
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,576
Don't touch anything until the police arrive. Got it?

31
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:22,727
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:29,567
Where did the shot come from? Which way is the wind blowing?

33
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,186
This way!

34
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,947
Hey, wait!

35
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,206
Hello? There's been a shooting near the end of the monorail line.

36
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:42,207
If you close the roads immediately, we can trap the culprit on the artificial island.

37
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,717
Yes, do it. I'll track down the culprit.

38
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:53,847
Inspector Megure, you heard him. What should we do?

39
00:04:56,077 --> 00:05:00,566
Instruct the monorail company to stop service.

40
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:05,346
Contact the Wangan Police Station and have them set up checkpoints

41
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,227
at all Wangan-Toto Station exits.

42
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:12,056
We'll also set up checkpoints on all nine bridges surrounding the artificial island.

43
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:15,916
We'll seal off the entire island and trap the culprit.

44
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:16,737
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:41,367
The moment the shot was fired, the monorail was around that spot on the rail.

46
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,567
The bullet entered through the second window from the front

47
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,677
and struck the victim's arm.

48
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,077
If we can determine the angle of the hole in the window,

49
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,077
the location of the shooting victim,

50
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:07,707
and the monorail's location at that time,

51
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:12,077
then we can calculate where the shot was fired from.

52
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,067
The shooter's location was probably...

53
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:27,797
It's that building.

54
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:31,337
But...

55
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:34,987
How do you know that?

56
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:39,487
What? Uh, my daily horoscope said my guesses would be right today.

57
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:42,247
I see. Your horoscope, huh?

58
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:44,656
Yeah, right!

59
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:48,917
Who would believe that nonsense?

60
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:54,256
Hey, look! I saw someone who might be the culprit over there!

61
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:56,106
What? Really?

62
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,557
All right, kid! Follow me!

63
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:05,437
Wait, Mister!

64
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,696
Excuse me, it's an emergency.

65
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,236
Could you open the door?

66
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:21,367
Judging by the height of the monorail car, the shot was probably fired from...

67
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:29,486
Mister, the fifth floor. The second window from the end was open.

68
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:31,097
What? Really?

69
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,437
Yeah, I was watching from inside the monorail.

70
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:00,337
It's unlocked.

71
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,627
There's no one here.

72
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:25,927
They fled.

73
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,886
This place is empty.

74
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,987
There's no sign of the shooter.

75
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:48,246
Maybe you made a mistake when you thought you saw the culprit.

76
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:51,747
That wasn't a mistake, it was a lie.

77
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,107
There's no mistaking it.

78
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,417
The shot was definitely fired from here.

79
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:44,177
Looks like a man lives alone here.

80
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,916
Mister, could you thoroughly search this apartment?

81
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,826
I'm going to look around outside.

82
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,736
H-Hey, wait.

83
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,026
We're already unlawfully entering.

84
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:53,987
Hey!

85
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:57,937
Hello, this is Takagi.

86
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,817
What is it?

87
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,086
We've arrived at the monorail.

88
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,817
Forensics is currently examining the crime scene.

89
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:10,696
Also, as you suggested, we've blocked off all the roads.

90
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:14,707
Have you figured out anything else?

91
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,707
Yes, it's about the victim.

92
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:21,366
His name is Maruta Daisuke-san, 28 years old.

93
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,006
He works for a construction company.

94
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:27,717
He was shot in the upper left arm, and he's in no danger of dying.

95
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:31,977
The bullet has been extracted, and he's currently resting.

96
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:36,076
He apparently doesn't know anyone who owns a gun,

97
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,977
nor has he done anything to incur someone's ill will.

98
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:42,316
But that's all according to him.

99
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,756
We'll continue with our investigation.

100
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:45,846
Got it.

101
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:48,987
I'll contact you right away if I find the culprit.

102
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,876
They're faint,

103
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:00,137
but there are scuff marks left by something heavy that was dragged down the hallway.

104
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,196
Huh? Conan-kun? What—

105
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,736
It's me. Takagi.

106
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:16,836
Mori-san, why are you calling from Conan-kun's phone?

107
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,766
Did you find the culprit?

108
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,836
No, not yet.

109
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,416
Then is there something you forgot to mention?

110
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,006
I suppose, yes.

111
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,777
Seriously? He must've been talking to the old man until a moment ago.

112
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:34,787
Anyway, there's a location I'd like forensics to examine immediately.

113
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,157
I'm counting on you.

114
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:43,137
What are you doing here?

115
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,586
Nothing.

116
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:50,097
Let's go. Standing around here is just a waste of our time.

117
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:57,727
Let's see...

118
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:03,557
Mister.

119
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,357
What is it?

120
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,697
What do you think this is?

121
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:09,867
Bloodstains.

122
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,117
They lead that way.

123
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,636
That's it.

124
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:19,316
In other words, the culprit is over there. Let's go.

125
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:20,377
Okay.

126
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,607
Hey, wait!

127
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,676
What's the problem?

128
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:31,876
Hey, Conan. We're pursuing a shooter, right?

129
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,427
Yeah, that's right.

130
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:37,227
Do the bloodstains have anything to do with the shooter?

131
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,177
Oh, right...

132
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,737
Checkpoint

133
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,747
Please Stop!

134
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:00,567
It's Takagi.

135
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:01,997
Hello?

136
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:04,306
Mori-san, you were right.

137
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:05,877
Impressive as always, Detective.

138
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,757
I was right? About what?

139
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,257
Oh, please.

140
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:13,007
I'm talking about room 505.

141
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:17,267
As you suspected, we found gunshot residue.

142
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:18,926
What?

143
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:22,397
Then the shot was fired from that room?

144
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:25,397
Yes, but that's not all.

145
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:31,277
We also observed a luminol reaction on the floor.

146
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:33,407
What?

147
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,526
The bloodstains were apparently wiped away after splattering on the floor.

148
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,917
Judging by the volume, the victim was probably...

149
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,167
The scuff marks in the hallway.

150
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:46,436
The scrap of plastic sheet.

151
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:49,667
The bullet that was fired, and the bloodstains in the room.

152
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:56,136
Does that mean your shot in the dark was right?

153
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,506
It's just a coincidence.

154
00:13:58,507 --> 00:13:59,656
Coincidence?

155
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:01,427
Yeah, a coincidence.

156
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:06,187
But I wonder if it was a coincidence that there were bloodstains in that room.

157
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:07,777
Coincidence?

158
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,207
Shot in the dark?

159
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,057
The bullet!

160
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:15,697
Takagi, have you figured out anything from the bullet that was fired?

161
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:22,207
Yes, forensics examined the bullet extracted from the victim's upper left arm.

162
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:30,397
It's a 30-caliber 7.62 millimeter full metal jacket Mauser military bullet,

163
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,717
also known as a Tokarev bullet.

164
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:36,847
You can snipe someone with a Tokarev from that distance?

165
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:37,957
I'm not sure,

166
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,597
but it's hard to imagine the culprit used a handgun to snipe the victim.

167
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:49,857
Which means the victim was coincidentally struck by a stray bullet?

168
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,356
Yes, it does seem that way.

169
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:56,157
Based on current evidence, the culprit shot someone in room 505,

170
00:14:57,437 --> 00:15:03,117
and the bullet passed through them.

171
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:07,437
That bullet flew outside the room,

172
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:12,927
pierced the monorail window, and struck the victim's arm.

173
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,387
Is that even possible?

174
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,887
There's a hundred meters between the window and the monorail line.

175
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:27,147
It passed through a person's body, pierced a monorail window, and struck someone's arm.

176
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:28,897
It's possible.

177
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:33,147
Tokarevs are designed to have excellent penetration.

178
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:35,897
It was a handgun and not a rifle?

179
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,196
Handguns and rifles have different trajectories,

180
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:42,657
but striking the first victim must have applied an angle to the bullet's path.

181
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,907
But that would mean...

182
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:50,946
It's impossible to do intentionally, but with the right series of coincidences...

183
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,417
It's not impossible.

184
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,747
In other words, that's the truth.

185
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,417
Hey, Mister.

186
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:03,427
We found the connection between the culprit and the bloodstains.

187
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:16,187
Found it.

188
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,037
Over here, Mister.

189
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:24,276
We can follow these bloodstains all we want,

190
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:27,566
but won't the culprit escape while we're wasting time here?

191
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,827
What's this smell?

192
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:56,227
Mister, there's a woman tied up in there.

193
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:58,737
This smell...

194
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,007
Mister, it's gasoline!

195
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,736
Damn it. The door is locked.

196
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,037
We'll have to break the window.

197
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,947
Hurry!

198
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:47,617
Run, mister!

199
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:22,727
Mori-san!

200
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:24,956
Detective Takagi.

201
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:25,907
Are you hurt?

202
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,027
We're fine.

203
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:31,036
Did that woman say anything?

204
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,146
Yeah.

205
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:34,537
She was rather frightened and distraught,

206
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,537
but she said while walking around this area,

207
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:40,187
something was suddenly placed against her mouth,

208
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,357
and she lost consciousness.

209
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,176
When she woke up after the attack,

210
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:49,366
she'd been abandoned inside the car.

211
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,826
Does she know who may have wanted to kidnap her?

212
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,937
She has no idea who it could've been.

213
00:18:55,777 --> 00:19:00,856
Detective Takagi, we've confirmed the victim's background and questioned her.

214
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:06,636
We didn't find anything in her background or testimony that would lead us to the culprit.

215
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,506
I see. Thank you.

216
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,637
Yes, sir. Excuse me.

217
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,707
No clues, huh?

218
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:19,607
Anyway, the culprit must have rather violent tendencies to set fire to a car.

219
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,917
They've probably been watching us tracking them down.

220
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,597
They did this to disrupt the investigation.

221
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,347
So, have there been any developments with the apartment?

222
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:34,926
As you suspected, they seem to have wrapped the victim in a sheet

223
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,347
and are transporting them somewhere.

224
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:43,227
Detective Takagi, why is the culprit taking the victim away from the apartment?

225
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,777
Well...

226
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,947
They're obviously trying to hide the evidence.

227
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:55,146
Don't you think carrying the victim around with them is too risky?

228
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:57,207
I suppose.

229
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:02,207
Perhaps there's a reason they have to take that risk.

230
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,377
If you were the culprit, what would you do?

231
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:06,547
What?

232
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:11,016
Well, normally you'd want to get rid of the victim as soon as possible.

233
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,736
But you're still carrying them with you.

234
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:13,886
Where would you take them?

235
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,107
I don't know.

236
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:20,346
If you carried something as large as a body through a normal place,

237
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:22,386
you'd draw attention to yourself.

238
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,937
Where would it seem natural to carry something large around here?

239
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,067
That's it. That place would work.

240
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:32,496
That's right.

241
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,806
There's only one place on this artificial island

242
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,857
where it wouldn't seem unnatural to carry something large.

243
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:42,317
It matches the direction indicated by the trail of blood, too.

244
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:50,017
Toto Market, Tokyo.

245
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:31,236
You certainly wouldn't stand out at Toto Market

246
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:34,386
by carrying something large and heavy,

247
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,387
like a tuna or amberjack.

248
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:40,387
But what is the culprit trying to accomplish by doing that?

249
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,397
Isn't determining that and catching the culprit our job?

250
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:10,667
Toto Market

251
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:23,197
The culprit should be somewhere in here.

252
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:48,057
What did the culprit come here to do?

253
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,516
This place is pretty big.

254
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:52,437
It's big and deserted.

255
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:56,197
It's the perfect place to hide a body.

256
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,047
We're playing hide-and-seek.

257
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:02,697
Are they hiding somewhere, or...?

258
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,707
Why don't you stop playing dumb?

259
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:14,537
The next episode of Conan is "The Monorail Sniper Case, Part Two!"
