1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,639
Triggered by the crime that occurred in Osaka,

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,739
Heiji Hattori, Kazuha Toyama

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:07,839
and Inspector Otaki of the Osaka Police Department

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,439
came to Tokyo to launch investigations.

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,739
The crime site that we, all six of us

6
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,339
including Pops, Ran and I headed for

7
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:19,039
was a condo in Tokyo.

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,639
However, the incident turned out to be a suicide case,

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,939
and was solved just like that.

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,039
While we were ready to leave the site

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,539
and waiting for the elevator...

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,039
Talk of the devil.

13
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,339
-Wh... -What?

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,839
Although it looked be suicide at first glance,

15
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,039
due to the many unsettling points that emerged,

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,839
we decided to investigate it as homicide.

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,739
And through the questioning carried out

18
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,039
by Officer Takagi and the others,

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,539
the suspects were narrowed down to three people.

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,939
By the way, what do you do for a living?

21
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,839
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

22
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,139
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

23
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:03,739
I also handle air conditioners.

24
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,939
Which means you also handle

25
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,339
elevator and security maintenance?

26
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:09,839
By the way, you.

27
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:13,139
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

28
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,239
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

29
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,739
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

30
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,939
Which means that you lost out on stocks because of Mr. Fuura,

31
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,539
and hated him too?

32
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,939
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

33
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,739
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

34
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,139
Oh. It's true that I lost out too,

35
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:35,339
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

36
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,239
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

37
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,239
Because it's my fault too

38
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,239
for not being able to read the direction of

39
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,039
where the stocks were headed for, you see.

40
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,039
This room smells of thinner.

41
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,339
That's because I was coloring

42
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,739
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

43
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:52,539
Freshly severed necks?

44
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,239
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

45
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,139
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

46
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,239
A freshly made severed neck

47
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,539
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

48
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,839
Well...

49
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:06,239
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

50
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,339
Can't you tell by looking?

51
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:12,739
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

52
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,439
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

53
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,639
calligraphy paint and ink.

54
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,939
I'm a cartoonist!

55
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,139
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

56
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,039
Oh, you're the author

57
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,139
of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

58
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,239
that Chiba is hooked on.

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,339
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

60
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,139
to come up with a story.

61
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,639
To make it look as if someone committed suicide

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,939
in the elevator by using a gun,

63
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,639
and kill him.

64
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,739
If I came up with such an amusing story,

65
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,839
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

66
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:44,739
The culprit is probably that person

67
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:45,939
who was hiding that thing.

68
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,839
The question is the trick...

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,339
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

70
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,639
Aim for a 100% solution.

71
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,039
Clear all mysteries and codes.

72
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,839
Murder in an elevator.

73
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,939
Expose the shocking trick together with Hattori.

74
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,539
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,039
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,890
"Everyone was Watching (Part 2)"

78
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,730
I tell you that Heiji!

79
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,230
What's taking him so long?

80
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,530
Come now.

81
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,930
You're going to be spending the night

82
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,430
at our place already so...

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,730
But...

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,930
Oh, he's back.

85
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,530
And, how was it?

86
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,330
Did you figure out who the culprit was?

87
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,330
No. We did talk to the three suspects though.

88
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,330
They all seem suspicious and yet unsuspicious too.

89
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,130
All three of them seem to have a motive, though.

90
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,230
No, the culprit is probably that person.

91
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,430
The question is the trick that was used.

92
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,230
Oh, that's right. By the way, on the doors of the elevators,

93
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,330
all except for the ones on the 2nd and 3rd floors,

94
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,330
there seem to have been an "under inspection" sign!

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,830
I see. That's how people were kept away.

96
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,130
Well, if it was suicide

97
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,730
you'd think that Mr. Fuura put it there

98
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,830
to avoid being interrupted.

99
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,030
Yes.

100
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,530
Hey! If you can't figure it out, why don't you call Kudo?

101
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,730
Huh?

102
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,330
Shinichi?

103
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,530
Yep! Even during that incident

104
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,130
at the family restaurant the other time,

105
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,830
the case was solved in no time at all

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,930
after Conan merely placed a call to him, right?

107
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,930
Idiot. He hasn't figured anything out yet either.

108
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,830
Well, I guess that's one way to do it.

109
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,430
You two are full-fledged only when you work together too so...

110
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,930
Hey, hold it! Just who are you talking about?

111
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,230
The two of us?

112
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,030
Make us full-fledged?

113
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,030
Wait a sec.

114
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,730
If that is used...

115
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,830
I get it! That's why.

116
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,630
Yeah. That word 'Goodbye'...

117
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,430
That was not a message made to look like a mere will.

118
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,230
It was written there deliberately

119
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,130
because it needed to be written there!

120
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,230
In order to join the tricks together.

121
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,330
Huh? Really?

122
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,230
Is it true that no discharge residue

123
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,130
was detected from the three suspects?

124
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,430
Yes, definitely.

125
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,330
I got a report from forensics a while ago.

126
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,030
I see.

127
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,530
I'm sorry I'm late.

128
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,430
I'm Megure from MPD.

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,630
Oh. I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

130
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,030
I'm sorry for sticking my nose

131
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,130
into a case that occurred outside our jurisdiction.

132
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,130
No, don't be. Officer Takagi told me that

133
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,130
you helped out a lot with the questioning and all.

134
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,930
But, is it true that this is a homicide?

135
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,130
You saw Mr. Fuura shoot himself in the head with a gun

136
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,430
through the window of this elevator, didn't you?

137
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,730
Speak of the devil!

138
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,430
Yes.

139
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,630
If so, isn't it suicide?

140
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,530
I thought so too at first but...

141
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,930
The surveillance camera in the elevator

142
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,030
was blotted out with spray paint with the left hand.

143
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,230
The wristwatch that the corpse was wearing was stopped

144
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,230
and so forth,

145
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,230
there were many ambiguous points to consider.

146
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,930
It seemed quite strange to me too,

147
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,130
but you witnessed Mr. Fuura commit suicide.

148
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,730
Inspector.

149
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,030
Let me answer your question.

150
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,630
The culprit held the gun against Mr. Fuura's head

151
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,430
and remarked like so...

152
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,630
'If you don't want to get shot,

153
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,730
look out through the window of the elevator.'

154
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,630
And when the elevator passed through this floor,

155
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,130
the gun was fired.

156
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,930
That's why when we saw that,

157
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,530
we all thought it was suicide.

158
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,230
I guess that's the truth.

159
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,830
That's impossible, no?

160
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,130
You'd all be aware no matter what

161
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,830
if the culprit's hand comes out from the side.

162
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,730
The position of the culprit's hand that is holding the gun

163
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,430
and the position of Mr. Fuura's body that was shot

164
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,030
wouldn't match.

165
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,530
True. I wouldn't do it if I were the culprit.

166
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,730
Such a special effect would be so obvious.

167
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,230
Besides, if so, Mr. Fuura would've put up more of a fight.

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,030
It's hard to think he would stay still enough

169
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,030
to make it look like a suicide.

170
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,630
Are these three people...

171
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,630
Yes. They are the three residents of this condo

172
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,230
who had no alibi.

173
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,730
But why are you here?

174
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,230
I didn't want to come but...

175
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,730
We were told to come here.

176
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,030
We were told that if we came here

177
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,430
we'd find out the truth to the case,

178
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,030
by this boy here.

179
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,630
Yes, I brought the three here!

180
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,630
Because Officer Takagi and Heiji told me to do so!

181
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,830
Conan?

182
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,330
Hey, Conan. Where's Heiji?

183
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,830
I haven't seen him for about an hour.

184
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,230
He said he was going somewhere with Officer Takagi.

185
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,030
Something about he had something to do

186
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,230
at the store in back of this condo.

187
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,530
The store in the back?

188
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,230
What store in the back?

189
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,930
If I remember correctly...

190
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,430
I see! The back!

191
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,530
The culprit used this method of "Helping Hands".

192
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,630
That is, the culprit hid behind Mr. Fuura and shot him!

193
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,630
It would look more natural

194
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,730
than to shoot him from the side, wouldn't it?

195
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,030
If so, when fired at, wouldn't Mr. Fuura's head move

196
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,030
exposing the face of the culprit behind him?

197
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,730
True.

198
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,630
Oh! It's Officer Takagi!

199
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,830
Bang!

200
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,130
Hey, what are you doing, Takagi?

201
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,790
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

202
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,690
Bang!

203
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,590
Hey, what are you doing?

204
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,790
But what we saw...

205
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,790
It was just like that!

206
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,490
So, two people were playing one person after all then!

207
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,590
Takagi and the detective boy from Osaka

208
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,590
tried acting it out!

209
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,590
To show us that if you do it right, it would look natural!

210
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,790
That Takagi...

211
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,290
Hurry down here and explain, Takagi!

212
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,590
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,390
Officer Takagi?

214
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,890
Oh, well you see...

215
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,790
Takagi! Just what was that about?

216
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,690
I just... I was just told to stay here

217
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,090
and watch how everyone reacted by Hattori, you see.

218
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,690
Watch?

219
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,890
And, since when were you there?

220
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,690
Just a little before the elevator came.

221
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,090
No way!

222
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,590
You were in the elevator a while ago, weren't you?

223
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,790
That was...

224
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,490
Officer Takagi's in the elevator again.

225
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,590
In other words, this is the truth of the trick!

226
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,990
A tablet?

227
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,490
Yeah. I had Officer Takagi borrow it for me

228
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,290
from the electric shop behind the condo!

229
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,090
The movie of the face of Officer Takagi

230
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,790
that I read into this tablet a while ago.

231
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,790
I played it again on the tablet by pushing it

232
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,190
against the window of the elevator.

233
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,190
Bang!

234
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,890
Since the window of the elevator

235
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,290
is partitioned with the word 'Goodbye',

236
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,790
if the tablet is used, the trick won't be exposed.

237
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,490
In fact, even though it was all my body apart from the head,

238
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,990
it really looked as if Officer Takagi was on the elevator, right?

239
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,590
In other words, the tablet and my body

240
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,490
both worked to make up just one of me!

241
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,590
But, Heiji. Isn't that a bit too far-fetched?

242
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,590
All you did was pretend to fire, Heiji.

243
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,490
We saw him shoot himself in the head, you know?

244
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,990
If it were as you say,

245
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,990
he had to hold the tablet in his hand

246
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,790
and fire right in front of his eyes

247
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,590
it would've been very dangerous.

248
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,690
And, you can't even be sure

249
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,090
if that movement will match the tablet's either.

250
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,790
Besides there should be another trace

251
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,990
of the remains of a bullet in the elevator too.

252
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,190
Wrong, wrong!

253
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,990
I didn't have time just now so I used only one tablet!

254
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,090
I think the culprit used four tablets!

255
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,690
Using four tablets, you can stream a movie

256
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,390
with timing that matches perfectly!

257
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,190
Four?

258
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,890
Then, are you saying that what we saw

259
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,190
were all movie images?

260
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,490
Right. All except for the face,

261
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,690
it was a movie taken by the culprit who was wearing

262
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,590
the same type of suit that Mr. Fuura was wearing.

263
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,690
But can you hold four tablets with one hand?

264
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,390
I wonder.

265
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,790
The culprit probably stuck four

266
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
onto one large board or something.

267
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,190
If so, all that needed to be done was to place it against the door.

268
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,290
Isn't that how it was done?

269
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,890
You hid the fact that you had four tablets.

270
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,290
Cartoonist, Ms. Naoko Izutsu.

271
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,990
You're the one, aren't you? The culprit?

272
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,090
Hey, wait a minute there!

273
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,190
As for the trick you just mentioned,

274
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,390
anyone could've done it using four tablets.

275
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,690
So, why do I end up being the one who did it?

276
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,590
It's because you're hiding the tablets!

277
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,290
The machine you had on the side of the tracing table

278
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,090
on top of your work area.

279
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,090
That's a mobile router, isn't it?

280
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,890
I'm saying it's strange that you had no computer or tablet

281
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,790
connected to the internet despite having the router!

282
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,290
How should I know?

283
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,890
Maybe the editor in charge forgot it there.

284
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,390
I'm an analog person

285
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,190
and don't use computers and such.

286
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,190
Oh, cartoonists are super, aren't they?

287
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,390
Because you're drawing detective cartoons, aren't you Miss?

288
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,390
Despite that there were only

289
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,290
a few comic books on your bookshelf!

290
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,290
To be able to draw and write all kinds of things

291
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,690
without having to look at anything.

292
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,990
I think that's really super!

293
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,590
True, that unlike fairy tales and fantasy novels,

294
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,490
detective comics would require

295
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,090
a realistic description to some extent.

296
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,690
As for the background of the crime site

297
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,590
or the murder weapon and such.

298
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,890
It's quite impossible to do all that without reference.

299
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,790
If I remember correctly, I think Ms. Izutsu

300
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,290
mentioned having three assistants.

301
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,090
So, three assistants and herself,

302
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,490
would add up to four tablets, eh?

303
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,190
But, how did she make up the image of Mr. Fuura being shot?

304
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,690
She couldn't possibly have told him

305
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,690
to act like he was being shot with a gun, could she?

306
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,790
That's easy!

307
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,190
When she was taking the movie like this,

308
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,990
all she had to do was move the camera a bit.

309
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,090
See! You get an image like he was shot!

310
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,290
Bullets aren't visible either way, besides!

311
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,890
The problem is that the things in the background

312
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,390
also get blurred.

313
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,890
But, it's hard to tell because there's nothing in the elevator.

314
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,190
True.

315
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,290
Wow, Conan.

316
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,090
Well, Heiji told me all this, you see.

317
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,190
Right, Heiji?

318
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,890
Yeah.

319
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,290
I feel like I've become the Sleeping Kogoro, or something.

320
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,590
But...

321
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,890
If we weren't coincidentally

322
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,390
in front of the elevator back then,

323
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,990
this trick wouldn't work.

324
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,390
It's not us! That she wanted to show what she did.

325
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,690
She wanted to show it to Nanami who goes to

326
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,490
the esthetic salon every week at that hour.

327
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,190
First, Ms. Izutsu, probably ask Mr. Fuura

328
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,890
to come to a coffee shop nearby

329
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,890
so that she could introduce a new client to him,

330
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,990
after which she told him that she'd go ahead

331
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,990
and wait for him by the elevator.

332
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,590
She also instructed him to wear the same suit

333
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,590
that was in the image.

334
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,390
Then, Ms. Izutsu who got to the elevator before him,

335
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,190
blotted out the surveillance camera in the elevator

336
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,090
with spray paint.

337
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,290
She closed the door once

338
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,290
and after spraying the word 'Goodbye',

339
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,090
she opened the door again.

340
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,790
Because nobody would push the button

341
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,790
since the "under inspection" sign was hung out,

342
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,490
the elevator would be stopped in position.

343
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,190
All she had left to do was to kill Mr. Fuura

344
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,390
when he was taken aback at seeing the word 'Goodbye'.

345
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,490
Then, she waited for the time

346
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,490
Nanami left for the esthetic salon.

347
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,590
Of course the door of the elevator was left open,

348
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,290
and she pushed the button of the floor that she lived on

349
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,490
which was above the 3rd floor

350
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,190
where Nanami would get on the elevator.

351
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,690
And, just about when Nanami would come to the elevator,

352
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,190
she closed the door and placed the board

353
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,990
with the four tablets attached to it against the door.

354
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,890
She streamed the movie after matching the timing with

355
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,190
when he would be shot in the head

356
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,990
just as the elevator was going pass the 3rd floor!

357
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,090
I see.

358
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,890
After that if she got off at her own floor

359
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,390
and took the board away,

360
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,990
it would end up a perfect murder.

361
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,590
There is no perfect murder to what a human commits.

362
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,390
Ms. Izutsu, in fact, goofed here and there.

363
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,090
One of them was when you stuck out your left hand

364
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,290
when the police said

365
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,790
they wanted to check for discharge residue.

366
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,890
It washes off with water, doesn't it?

367
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,890
The discharge residue.

368
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,390
You were holding the towel, the comic and the lighter

369
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,790
in your right hand,

370
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,890
so I suppose you're right-handed.

371
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,890
You went out of your way to shoot Mr. Fuura

372
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,390
who was left-handed with your left hand

373
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,990
to match his actions.

374
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,790
If you shot him as is with your right hand,

375
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,290
there would be a discrepancy in the discharge residue

376
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,190
that would remain on the grip of the gun.

377
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,890
And the other mistake was the automatic winding wristwatch.

378
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,190
Since Mr. Fuura was wearing a wristwatch

379
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,490
different from yours in the image,

380
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,690
you switched your watch with his

381
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,290
that he gave you some time ago, right?

382
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,790
You also shook it a bit to match the time too.

383
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,090
Well, I guess the two

384
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,190
who are always wearing it already know, though.

385
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,390
If it's shaken only for a little while, it stops right away.

386
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,790
The fact that you didn't know about it,

387
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,390
means that you're the culprit.

388
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,790
That wristwatch isn't mine, you know.

389
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,190
The one Mr. Fuura gave me

390
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,090
was a woman's watch and much smaller.

391
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,790
Then, whose watch was it?

392
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,890
Teacher Mizuki's.

393
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,290
You remember, don't you?

394
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,990
The old man who hung himself to death last month

395
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,390
in this condo?

396
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,190
The teacher? Don't tell me that...

397
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,690
He was my homeroom teacher in high school.

398
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,990
I didn't think he was living in this condo

399
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,790
until I ran into him coincidentally at this elevator, though.

400
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,390
Then, was this murder committed to avenge

401
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,690
the death of your mentor who was driven to commit suicide?

402
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,090
Well, sort of.

403
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,490
My primary motive was because I was sad, maybe.

404
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,290
Sad?

405
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,990
After he committed suicide,

406
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,290
I remembered that I had left my high school album with him

407
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,890
so I asked the manager to let me into his room.

408
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,890
I happened to realize.

409
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,090
That he'd set up a trick to make it look like

410
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,790
he was killed by somebody

411
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,590
while he actually committed suicide.

412
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,090
Don't you think it's sad?

413
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,590
In my cartoons,

414
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,490
a detective would make all kinds of deductions.

415
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,090
And yet, no one realized the trick that was set up.

416
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,290
And the case was closed as a suicide case.

417
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,890
That's why.

418
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,890
I just wanted to carry out what Mr. Mizuki left unfinished.

419
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,490
If not, it would be too unsettling.

420
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,290
You're letting me spend the night

421
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,090
at your place too, Mr. Mouri?

422
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,290
Yes.

423
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,790
It'll probably be difficult to get a hotel room from now anyway.

424
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,790
Thank you very much.

425
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,290
Hey, hold it!

426
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,290
You mean all four of us, you,

427
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,290
this brat, Mr. Otaki and I are going to sleep in your room?

428
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,290
Packed sardines.

429
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,690
Then, why don't you sleep with us in our room, Conan?

430
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,690
Right!

431
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,690
We'll sleep in one line with Conan in the middle.

432
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,390
If it's okay with you two, Ran, I don't mind.

433
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,190
Watch it, you little pervert.

434
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,190
Please excuse me.

435
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,490
Yes, hello. Otaki here.

436
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,290
It's me.

437
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,890
Chief of headquarters!

438
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,790
What seems to be the matter? At this time of day?

439
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,590
A troublesome case has just been reported, you see.

440
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,390
I thought of rejecting it

441
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,390
because it's not in our jurisdiction but...

442
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,390
Since you're in Tokyo now,

443
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,790
I figured I'd have you check it out.

444
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,890
What is it? This troublesome case?

445
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,890
Otaki, do you think they exist in this world?

446
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,690
Vampires?

447
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,890
If you're going to come out, be careful.

448
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,490
The talk about the inheritance

449
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,190
of the estate in question will be discussed after dinner.

450
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,990
The master's whereabouts are still unknown?

451
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,190
No. We've split up and are looking for him though.

452
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,390
A coffin?

453
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,590
No one should go into something like this before dying!

454
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,990
Next Conan,

455
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,890
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (One)"

456
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,590
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,790
"Coffin"

458
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,390
Hattori? Talking in his sleep?

459
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,890
You want me to suck your blood?

460
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,590
Oh, the preview of next week.
