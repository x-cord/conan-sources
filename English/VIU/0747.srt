1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:04,188
Sonoko invites Kyogoku to come to the Suzuki residence.

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:09,988
But he ends up being disliked by Tomoko, Sonoko's mother.

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:15,588
Moreover, he sees Sonoko getting all excited over talk of Thief Kid.

4
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,388
Thief Kid?

5
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:18,788
What's going on?

6
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:20,888
Advisor!

7
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:25,488
I, here am called Makoto Kyogoku.

8
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:29,788
I'm a greenhorn that is now courting Sonoko.

9
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,888
You're Sonoko's boyfriend.

10
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:36,088
And, just what do you want with me?

11
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:38,588
I've heard that you're in possession of a jewel

12
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:41,588
that a thief, what's his name is seeking.

13
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:43,788
If so, I would like to offer you my services.

14
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:45,888
Won't you please assign me, Makoto Kyogoku

15
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,788
to guard this for you at the foot of the table, if you will?

16
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,288
"Sonoko"

17
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:54,188
What kind of guy is he?

18
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,788
I hear that he practices karate.

19
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,788
He's no ordinary karate practitioner, you know!

20
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:01,088
He has won 400 World Karate Championships with no losses,

21
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:04,488
an invincible prince of attacks!

22
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:10,188
Four... four-hundred championships, no losses?

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:16,088
Don't put any guards into the exhibition room of the jewel?

24
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,388
Thief Kid's coming to steal, you know?

25
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:22,788
Advisor Suzuki called me a while ago

26
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:26,188
and said that they would get in the way of the newest security systems.

27
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:34,088
One man is being surrounded by men armed with guns?

28
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:37,088
Of course they're just airsoft pellets,

29
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,588
but still, with this number of men at this range...

30
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,888
Moreover, the man in the middle

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,688
is wearing a gas mask that interferes with his visibility.

32
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,388
You'd think that it'd be impossible for him to avoid the pellets, huh?

33
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:02,288
He's the world's most formidable security system.

34
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,988
Tomoko makes a proposal to Kyogoku

35
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,388
and Kid does likewise, to Sonoko,

36
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,888
each asking their target to make a bet with them.

37
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:16,288
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

38
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,888
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

39
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,588
Thief Kid's surprising strategy.

40
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,588
Where will the security system battle lead to?

41
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,088
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,888
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:27,388
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:14,656
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 2)".

45
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:18,112
Hang in there, Makoto!

46
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:19,512
Sure thing.

47
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:22,512
I...

48
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,812
believe in you.

49
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:28,012
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

50
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,212
with these fists of mine!

51
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,312
Come along now, Sonoko.

52
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:51,812
I also have faith in you

53
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:55,512
and believe that you will keep your word.

54
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,212
Yes, I will.

55
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,612
Of course.

56
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,212
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

57
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:14,112
Won't you like to make a bet with me?

58
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,612
Make a bet?

59
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:17,812
Right.

60
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:21,912
If you succeed in protecting the jewel...

61
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:23,912
I'll accept that as fate,

62
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:27,412
and approve of you going with Sonoko.

63
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:32,012
If you fail and that thief surpasses you...

64
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:35,312
I'll have you give up Sonoko, no questions asked,

65
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,912
understand?

66
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:51,412
Kid, Kid, Kid...

67
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:58,912
-Kid! -Kid!

68
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:01,312
-Kid, Kid. -Kid!

69
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:05,512
What? A letter from Kid was delivered here to this museum?

70
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:09,512
On top of that, it's addressed to this man again?

71
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:10,712
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,512
About 100 letters. All at once.

73
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:14,812
"Makoto Kyogoku" -A hundred?

74
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,212
It looks like it has to be heated again.

75
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:25,612
Hey, hey, we can't be heating up all 100 letters, you know.

76
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:29,012
Please get ready some candles and candle stands.

77
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:33,412
I think we can save time by doing so.

78
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,412
Hey, somebody!

79
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,812
Bring some candles and candle stands!

80
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,512
What? What's this?

81
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:48,512
"I never let go of a prey I catch because I'm the world's greatest thief.

82
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:51,412
Nothing is impossible for the magician under the moon.

83
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,412
My opponent is the world's most formidable security system?

84
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,112
What a laugh."

85
00:06:56,112 --> 00:07:01,612
I mean, none of these mean anything at all!

86
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,512
Stand back, move back!

87
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,812
Move back a bit more, please!

88
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,312
Please don't get any closer than this!

89
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,612
You can't call this an exhibition at all.

90
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,612
But, what is this anyway?

91
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:21,812
This large number of letters...

92
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:27,412
Is it to throw Kyogoku who's protecting the jewel off?

93
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,212
Or...

94
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,912
-Kid! Kid! Kid! -It is closing time.

95
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:35,912
Thank you for visiting today.

96
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:38,912
All guests please quickly leave the premises.

97
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:41,412
It is closing time.

98
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:45,112
Thank you for visiting today.

99
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:48,112
All guests please quickly leave the premises.

100
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:54,212
Okay, I'm ready when you are, Phantom Thief Kid!

101
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,712
I'll make you pay for all you've done so far!

102
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,312
Rather, he will!

103
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,212
I've got a bad feeling.

104
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:09,412
It seems that he's falling for Thief Kid.

105
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:11,412
What's the matter, Conan?

106
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,412
You look scary.

107
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,712
Ran!

108
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:20,212
What do you think?

109
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,712
I chose the most orthodox one.

110
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,312
I... I think it looks nice on you.

111
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:27,712
Oh? I'm glad!

112
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,012
Orthodox?

113
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,812
It's so open at the breasts.

114
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:38,112
Makoto!

115
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,012
This is the one I chose!

116
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:43,912
Don't forget, okay?

117
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,212
Okay.

118
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:58,112
Well, there's five minutes to go before the scheduled time.

119
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:01,212
Will everyone please leave this exhibition room?

120
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:09,012
If anyone should come in here before all is completed,

121
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:11,512
I shall deem them to be my enemy

122
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,512
and repress whoever with all my might.

123
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:18,712
-Yes... -I got it.

124
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,012
I'll leave the rest to you.

125
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,112
Okay!

126
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,012
Be it us or anyone else,

127
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,212
don't let them into this room!

128
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,712
Yes, sir!

129
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:44,012
I've got to go to the ladies' room!

130
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,912
Hey!

131
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:50,512
Those are letters that were received from Kid, right?

132
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:51,712
Yeah.

133
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:53,512
There are so many.

134
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:58,512
Did the person from the post office come to deliver them?

135
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:00,612
No. Sonoko told me

136
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:04,912
that the postman gave them to her directly a while ago.

137
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,912
Sonoko did?

138
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:09,812
Was she wearing those clothes back then?

139
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,512
Good work!

140
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,012
Yeah, she said that she changed first

141
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,212
and went outside to check things out,

142
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:20,912
then coincidentally saw a postman that she knew.

143
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,812
May I please have a look at the letters?

144
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,012
I won't take them out of the bag!

145
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,012
Hey!

146
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:34,812
It doesn't react to black light after all.

147
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,812
Which means...

148
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,012
Don't tell me that Sonko's...

149
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,512
Black... blackout?

150
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,419
I'm sorry, Makoto.

151
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:07,453
Kid, Kid, Kid!

152
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,226
Black... blackout?

153
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:15,526
Something's shining.

154
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,726
Moreover, there are a lot of them.

155
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,526
Florescent paint?

156
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,826
Huh? Something's rolling over here.

157
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:32,426
No! Ran, stay away from it!

158
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,026
Stay calm!

159
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:40,926
It's the usual anesthetic gas!

160
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:43,426
So long as you wear the gas mask, this is nothing!

161
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:53,826
Darn!

162
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:01,526
Why you, Kid?

163
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,426
This voice is Sonoko's.

164
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,826
Makoto! May I come in?

165
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,726
Makoto!

166
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,826
Sonoko, what on earth's the matter?

167
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:33,526
The Phantom Kid suddenly caused a blackout

168
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,626
and filled the entire museum with anesthetic gas!

169
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:40,226
I had this gas mask that I received from one of the officers

170
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,726
so I didn't fall asleep, you see.

171
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,126
Thief Kid fired his cards gun at all the other officers

172
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:47,526
and removed their masks.

173
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:54,626
What the...

174
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:55,726
Since there was something

175
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:58,226
that looked to be florescent paint on the gas masks,

176
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:02,026
Kid probably used it as a guide to...

177
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:05,926
Which mean that he's still nearby.

178
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:09,026
I think he already fled.

179
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:12,726
It seems that a card from Kid was received before the blackout

180
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,126
saying that he got hold of the jewel.

181
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,526
No way!

182
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,726
As you can see,

183
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:20,126
I've been wearing this jewel pendant around my neck right through.

184
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:23,326
At any rate, let's verify it in a bright place!

185
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,026
Whether the jewel is genuine or not.

186
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:34,326
It's hard to tell just by the light of the moon through the skylight.

187
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,326
If so...

188
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,526
Let's use candle light.

189
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,726
Right!

190
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,126
There were candles that were used to heat the letters up.

191
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:48,126
If I remember correctly, the genuine stone was green, right?

192
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:53,626
It's red? It's shiny red!

193
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:57,226
So, Kid switched it for the genuine one after all.

194
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,226
But...

195
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:02,226
When on earth? How?

196
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,126
Okay, then.

197
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:06,826
For the time being,

198
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:11,726
I'll go hand this fake over to the Inspector.

199
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,426
Okay.

200
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:17,726
Will you go look after the officers who were put to sleep then, Makoto?

201
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,326
You...

202
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:27,626
aren't Sonoko, are you?

203
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,926
What're you talking about?

204
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,726
I'm really me!

205
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:33,426
Though this jewel may be fake.

206
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,126
The jewel's genuine!

207
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,626
Conan?

208
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:44,626
Alexandrite under sunlight with a strong blue green spectrum

209
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:49,226
or the florescent light within this museum is dark green in color

210
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:52,326
but if placed under incandescent light

211
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,326
with a strong red spectrum or candle light,

212
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,626
it turns vivid red.

213
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,126
In other words,

214
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,226
the reason why so many meaningless letters

215
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:03,526
that needed to be heated were sent over

216
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:08,126
was to have candles brought in here!

217
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:13,226
You hid those letters somewhere in this museum beforehand,

218
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,226
and after disguising yourself as Sonoko, probably passed them on, right?

219
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:17,726
If you sent them out through the post office

220
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:19,626
and by some mistake heat is applied to them,

221
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,026
your heating trick would go down the drain.

222
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:23,526
As proof this,

223
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:26,726
barcodes for separate management printed by the post office

224
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,026
weren't on any of the letters, were they?

225
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:34,026
That is, the invisible ink that reacts to blacklight.

226
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,526
Then, are you insinuating that Kid ripped off my clothes

227
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:40,626
to disguise himself?

228
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:41,726
No.

229
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:48,126
Sonoko took her clothes off herself and gave it to you, Kid!

230
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:51,426
In order to settle the bet that Sonoko made with you!

231
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:53,026
Bet?

232
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:55,826
Yeah.

233
00:15:55,826 --> 00:16:01,026
Whether or not you, Mr. Kyogoku would be able to see through

234
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,526
Kid disguised as Sonoko.

235
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:14,126
Heck! He dodged?

236
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,326
Rats, bummers!

237
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,626
Where'd he go?

238
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,026
Where is he?

239
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,226
The Green Emperor is mine!

240
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:54,426
Well, you only have yourself to curse for your incompetence to fly.

241
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:57,726
Mr. World's Most Formidable Security System, no?

242
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,426
You rat...

243
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,026
Stand back.

244
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,126
Huh?

245
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:20,226
Broke the pillar with Karate?

246
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:23,526
Don't tell me that he plans to down the ceiling by breaking the pillar?

247
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:27,426
Monster!

248
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,826
I'd better split.

249
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,626
No joke.

250
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,426
He... he flew?

251
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,426
He's sure the world's most formidable.

252
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,026
Okay.

253
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,726
Will you please give it back to me?

254
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,826
The jewel

255
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,826
as well as Sonoko's heart.

256
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:13,226
Yes, since the jewel isn't what I was after,

257
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,826
I can give it back to you,

258
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:20,326
but not so with Sonoko's heart.

259
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:21,426
What?

260
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,526
It's not a question of giving anything back to you

261
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,926
because it hasn't been stolen to begin with.

262
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,126
At the point that I asked to make the bet with me.

263
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:42,926
Okay! I'll make the bet with you, but...

264
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:45,426
make sure you don't hurt Makoto.

265
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:49,726
Because he has a large tournament to compete in next week.

266
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,426
Who's there?

267
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,726
Thief Kid?

268
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,326
Well, well...

269
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:02,426
It seems that my coming here couldn't be kept a secret.

270
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,726
So, make up a story to tell your friend.

271
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,626
And, especially to that boy wearing glasses.

272
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,426
Well, unfortunately,

273
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:18,626
it seems you got slightly hurt.

274
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,126
But as for the bet, I completely...

275
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,026
lost to Sonoko!

276
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:07,426
What?

277
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:08,926
Your clothes and everything was taken off

278
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:11,826
and you were confined in the toilet compartment?

279
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,826
Is that true, Sonoko?

280
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:15,126
Yeah, I guess so.

281
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:17,726
He's merciless even to women!

282
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:21,626
Kid told you to say so, didn't he?

283
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,526
Otherwise, you'd be his accomplice.

284
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:24,526
Then, don't tell me

285
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:27,826
that the florescent paint on the gas mask was put there by...

286
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,826
Good work!

287
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,426
Back then!

288
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:38,426
Darn! That Kid!

289
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:45,626
But, you sure did a good job at protecting the jewel.

290
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:50,026
No, because Kid got away after all.

291
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,726
I offer my deepest apology.

292
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,926
No problem, no problem.

293
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:56,326
This challenge is postponed until next time.

294
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,126
When I most certainly will...

295
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,926
Yes, sir! That time for sure.

296
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:03,426
Good response, sonny! That's indeed what I would expect

297
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:06,326
of the world's most formidable security system.

298
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,926
He's a pretty gallant young man, isn't he?

299
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,426
Yes.

300
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:18,726
He's honest, unsophisticated, polite and tough.

301
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:22,526
He tickles my fantasy.

302
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:23,726
She scares me.

303
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,026
I'm sorry, Makoto.

304
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,626
I sort of ended up testing you.

305
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:32,226
-No, don't be. -And...

306
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:36,526
when did you realize that it was Kid in disguise?

307
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:40,726
Like I was prettier than him, after all?

308
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,426
Well? Well?

309
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:44,626
That was it, wasn't it?

310
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,126
Well...

311
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,626
The fact is...

312
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,826
What?

313
00:22:54,826 --> 00:23:00,426
Kid's index finger was longer than mine?

314
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:03,026
You mean that's seriously how you found out?

315
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:05,126
Yes. I've got this habit of

316
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,426
seeing right through the physical characteristics of my opponent

317
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,326
in the wink of an eye, you see.

318
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,526
Wasn't there anything else?

319
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,826
Like I've got a purer heart or something like that?

320
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,726
Purer?

321
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:22,226
Like, more chaste or untouched...

322
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,426
That's nothing to think so hard over!

323
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,626
I... I'm sorry.

324
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,026
Come on!

325
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,126
Well, it's said that due to hormones,

326
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:32,126
women have longer index fingers than ring fingers

327
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,726
and men are vice versa.

328
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:38,426
Although there seems to be a lot of exceptions.

329
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:42,026
Oh, my ring finger's longer!

330
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,726
"Next Episode"

331
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,726
I wonder if there was an accident there or something.

332
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,626
But those flowers...

333
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:54,326
I don't have it. You know, that...

334
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:57,126
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

335
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:02,326
Something smells after all.

336
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:06,826
Please don't tell anyone because it's embarrassing.

337
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,626
Yes, of course not!

338
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:10,226
Next Conan,

339
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:14,126
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Confession)".

340
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:32,326
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:34,426
"Masked Yaiba".

342
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:35,726
Boy, that was close!

343
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,326
There's another master of Karate.

344
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:39,326
I know her really well.
