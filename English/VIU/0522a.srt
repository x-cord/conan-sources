1
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:02,998
A year ago,

2
00:00:02,998 --> 00:00:08,198
I, Shinichi Kudo solved a murder case at East Okuho Village.

3
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:11,198
A letter saying that a deduction miss that I made

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:14,598
was found was delivered to me via Heiji Hattori.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,298
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -We went over to East Okuho Village

6
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:20,498
to meet with the sender Mr. Makoto Okuda, but...

7
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:23,198
Makoto's whereabouts was presently unknown.

8
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:27,198
And, for some reason,

9
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:30,798
the villagers seemed to have feelings of enmity against Shinichi Kudo.

10
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,298
I went alone to the mountain cabin

11
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:34,798
where Makoto had arranged to meet me.

12
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,498
Excuse me.

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,098
This thing I'm feeling...

14
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,398
It can't be...

15
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:45,398
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

16
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:48,198
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,398
That medicine is the miracle drug

18
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:51,698
that could maybe change his body

19
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:53,398
that had become that of a child due to APTX 4869

20
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:55,398
to the body of the high school student that it used to be.

21
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,598
Shinichi?

22
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:58,798
Shinichi!

23
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:02,398
Shinichi...

24
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,698
Is that my name?

25
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,998
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

26
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,398
Lost his memory?

27
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,598
That drug is only a prototype.

28
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,598
There may be a slight discrepancy

29
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:18,198
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

30
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:19,698
Twenty four hours?

31
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,498
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

32
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,698
or else we're in big trouble.

33
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:28,298
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

34
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,198
He just may remember something.

35
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:33,998
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

36
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,898
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

37
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,398
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

38
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:44,898
The motive for the Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

39
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,998
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

40
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,398
and he was full of despair.

41
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,798
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -The problem arose when Mr. Kudo

42
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:54,798
publicized the truth a year ago.

43
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:57,498
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign,

44
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:59,898
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

45
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:01,998
Hearing this, the former he seemed very happy.

46
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:03,598
What?

47
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,598
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

48
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:10,598
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

49
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,398
The truth that you're trying to hide

50
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:16,898
the fact that you cannot speak of.

51
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,398
Did I do it?

52
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,898
Did I... kill her?

53
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,598
Hold up for a while,

54
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,798
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

55
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:35,298
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

56
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,098
Impossible crime.

57
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,498
A mysterious murder trick, but...

58
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,398
Shinichi would...

59
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,198
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

60
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:50,498
Death...

61
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:51,498
Please.

62
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,898
Return Shinichi back to normal.

63
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,498
Death.

64
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:13,398
A crisis is gracefully revived.

65
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,498
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

66
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,298
The unbelievable truth that Heiji discloses.

67
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,198
Ran's tears doesn't stop as she watches Shinichi.

68
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,798
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,698
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,698
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

71
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:11,956
Sorry, Ran.

72
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,456
Go on home ahead.

73
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,056
Oh, hey.

74
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:22,556
I'll catch up with you right away!

75
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,956
Shinichi!

76
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,356
He's going away.

77
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,656
Shinichi's...

78
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,356
Shinichi's going away.

79
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:34,756
No. Don't go.

80
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:40,056
Shinichi!

81
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:54,856
"Shinichi's True Colors and Ran's Tears"

82
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,456
Where am I?

83
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,756
I remember.

84
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:09,056
I found Death in the forest and I went after him

85
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,756
then I slipped.

86
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,956
My wounds are treated.

87
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:20,056
Who on earth?

88
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,056
Ran!

89
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,356
I found Ran!

90
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:29,056
-What? -Kazuha.

91
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,256
Are you all right?

92
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,956
What's with the bandages?

93
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:39,556
I fell in the forest and passed out.

94
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:42,556
It seems that someone brought me here and treated my wounds.

95
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:46,356
I'm sure it was the owner of this hut

96
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:49,656
so we've got to thank him when he gets back.

97
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:53,456
No, the owner of this hut doesn't seem to be a nice person.

98
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,956
What?

99
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,756
The transceiver?

100
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,756
Heiji, where are you?

101
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,356
In the next room.

102
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,356
Come over here, will you? The place is a mess.

103
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,656
Come over you say,

104
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,856
but the door is closed off with a wooden board.

105
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,256
Go outside once and come in through the window.

106
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,956
Yes, I guess so.

107
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,256
Hey, what's this?

108
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,356
This place is full of the pictures

109
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,256
and articles of the detective kid.

110
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:29,056
Yes. It seems that whoever it is, is really infatuated with Kudo.

111
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,756
To the point of wanting to kill him.

112
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,356
His picture is slashed up.

113
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:37,756
Ran, didn't you really see the person who carried you here?

114
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:41,556
No, all I saw was Death in the forest.

115
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,156
Death?

116
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,156
Are you serious?

117
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:49,556
It seems that the owner of this hut is that what you may call "Death".

118
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:51,756
Look at this.

119
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:55,156
It's gray hair made of polyester used to make wigs.

120
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,956
The hair of Death that you saw was also white, wasn't it?

121
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:03,456
Yes, but he didn't look like such a bad person,

122
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,756
although I was scared.

123
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:05,956
I guess so.

124
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:08,556
After all he seems to have treated Ran's wounds for her too.

125
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,856
Maybe he's up to no good after feigning to be kind

126
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,656
and getting everyone off guard.

127
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:17,656
Well, but it's true that he's a dangerous character for sure.

128
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:22,056
There's an empty box for bullets.

129
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:24,556
Shattered pieces of glass of cracked mirrors.

130
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,556
There are at least 5 to 6 cracked mirrors.

131
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,756
And to top everything off...

132
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:34,156
The nasty words that are carved on this desk say.

133
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:37,656
"Failure means death".

134
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:41,656
Hey, if there's an empty box for bullets, it means...

135
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:46,656
Yes. It means that Death may be carrying around a dangerous weapon.

136
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,656
Does that mean that the one who stabbed

137
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:52,156
the newspaper reporter lady

138
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,956
and made it look like Shinichi did it, is Death's doing?

139
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:55,456
Yes, most likely.

140
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,856
Since he seems to hate Kudo too.

141
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:02,856
But if so, he would've had to call the lady and Kudo

142
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,756
over to that house and wait for them.

143
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,356
But the shoe prints of the culprit

144
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:10,656
weren't found anywhere around the house.

145
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,556
It rained all night and the ground was damp,

146
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:15,256
and yet nothing was found.

147
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:19,256
Maybe he was already in the house before it started raining?

148
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,356
Idiot!

149
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,156
If so, the culprit could've never made it out of the house

150
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:25,056
without leaving any footprints behind.

151
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:27,856
I checked around the house last night

152
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,756
because of the case that happened a year ago

153
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,656
and found that in order to go in and out of the house,

154
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,456
you have to walk on the ground somewhere around the house

155
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,056
no matter how you do it.

156
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:39,956
Besides, before the police and ambulance came this morning,

157
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:42,456
we searched through the house,

158
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,456
but found nobody there, right?

159
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,356
True.

160
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:51,556
Right. Who called the police and ambulance?

161
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,856
Did you hear anything on it?

162
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,156
Yes.

163
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,856
Both calls seem to have been made

164
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,756
by the same young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

165
00:09:58,756 --> 00:09:59,856
What?

166
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,956
Couldn't that have been Shinichi?

167
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:05,856
In fact, the person who called the newspaper reporter,

168
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,856
Mrs. Kawauchi at the inn she was staying at,

169
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,056
was also said to have been a young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

170
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:14,356
The man who called them said that his name was Shinichi Kudo.

171
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,756
You mean Kudo called that lady

172
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:19,656
and called the ambulance and police as well?

173
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:25,156
Could it be that he's pretending to have amnesia,

174
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,356
but actually thinking of something?

175
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:29,556
Mrs. Kawauchi said something similar to what you just said too.

176
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:30,556
What?

177
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:34,456
That remark that Mrs. Kawauchi made last night still bothers me.

178
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:37,156
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

179
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:40,756
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

180
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:44,056
After that, I went to Mrs. Kawauchi's inn to ask her about it,

181
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,356
and she answered me.

182
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:49,456
She said that Mr. Kudo is just faking he has amnesia.

183
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:52,456
And that he has something up his sleeve.

184
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:53,956
I see.

185
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:56,356
The lady said what she did last night

186
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,056
hoping to get more information on Kudo.

187
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,656
At any rate, there's no mistake

188
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:03,856
that this is the house of a dangerous character.

189
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:05,456
We've got to call the police over here right away.

190
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,156
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:10,056
I know we can somehow get out of the forest,

192
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:12,956
but I'm not sure if we'll be able to make it back here again.

193
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,856
Then, we'll make a bonfire again

194
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:17,656
and use the smoke to guide us.

195
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,156
Bonfire?

196
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,356
Yes.

197
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,856
You saw the bonfire near the stone

198
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:25,156
that looked like a tombstone, didn't you?

199
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,856
That's what was burning.

200
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:29,156
He was just probably getting dinner ready,

201
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,856
when we showed up. So, he probably got up and fled.

202
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:36,856
Could it be that the culprit fled from the little window

203
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,956
by the ceiling of the next room?

204
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:42,456
You mean that window.

205
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:46,056
But, isn't it a bit too small for an adult to make it out of there?

206
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:52,056
The shoe prints of a child's shoes.

207
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,656
It's Kudo.

208
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:56,856
I'm sure he was summoned here by that letter

209
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,756
"Mr. Shinichi Kudo" -and confined here.

210
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:02,156
So, he escaped from that window.

211
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,956
But who on earth confined him?

212
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:10,056
The whereabouts of Makoto Okuda's been unknown for the past six months.

213
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:14,156
I'm sure Makoto's been killed.

214
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:18,156
Is Makoto Okuda dead or alive?

215
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,456
Hold it, hold it.

216
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:22,756
Let me think it over from the start once more.

217
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:25,956
The slashed up pictures of Kudo.

218
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:29,356
It seems that the culprit really hates him.

219
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:31,256
And the words on the desk.

220
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,556
The culprit is trying to do something

221
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:34,756
even if it means taking his own life.

222
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,056
Is he planning to take revenge on Kudo?

223
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:41,056
There was an empty box for bullets in the next room.

224
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:44,456
The culprit most likely is armed with a gun.

225
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:47,656
I'm sure he had many chances to shoot Kudo if he wanted to.

226
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:50,356
Why didn't he do anything?

227
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:53,956
The lady called Kawauchi was stabbed with a knife.

228
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,156
How on earth is he planning to use the gun?

229
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,656
And, another thing that's bothering me is...

230
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,556
the mirror that was shattered to pieces.

231
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:06,556
Why did he have to crack so many mirrors like that?

232
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:09,156
Don't tell me that...

233
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,356
Don't tell me that he...

234
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:22,434
While you go out and call the police,

235
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,434
I'd like you to check on something for me.

236
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,834
But, how on earth am I going to check on something like that?

237
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,434
Don't worry.

238
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:39,034
This will do it, I guarantee.

239
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,334
Will this be enough?

240
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:43,534
I guess so.

241
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,634
That'll be enough for us to see the smoke from far away too.

242
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:49,434
And we won't have to go around in circles getting lost in the forest.

243
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:52,134
I wonder what sport consists of going around in circles,

244
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:55,034
you know, that Mr. Hinohara used to do?

245
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,334
I think it's some kind of field and track sports.

246
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,134
Remember, I told you that we asked the person

247
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,834
at the inn about Death, right?

248
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:08,934
We asked that person what sport Mr. Hinohara was into,

249
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:10,334
and was told that although he wasn't sure of what it was called

250
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,634
but said it was something that spun round and round.

251
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,034
Spin round and round?

252
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,634
Field sports that would include spinning something

253
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:20,034
would either be hammer throwing or discus.

254
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:23,034
Oh, right, he also mentioned that Mr. Hinohara was good at quoits.

255
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:24,234
Quoits?

256
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:29,534
It seems that his son, Daiki was bragging about it to everyone.

257
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,034
He goes around saying that his father was really good at quoits

258
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:35,034
an always got a perfect score.

259
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:37,634
Perfect score?

260
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:44,534
-It's that police officer. -Darn!

261
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:52,134
Hey!

262
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,334
What's up? What's wrong?

263
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,834
Death...

264
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:05,134
Death suddenly appeared before my eyes then...

265
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,634
I suddenly passed out.

266
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:18,934
Hey, the mouth of the holster of the gun is open!

267
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:22,534
Don't worry.

268
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,134
Your gun hasn't been taken.

269
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:28,134
But, why only the gun?

270
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,434
You mean he bought the bullets but didn't own a gun?

271
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,934
I wonder... I can't say for now yet.

272
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,734
But, I more or less have an idea of the case.

273
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,434
Later for the hut.

274
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,634
Let's get everybody together at Mr. Hinohara's house

275
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:46,534
and solve the mystery, shall we?

276
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,834
A High School Detective from Osaka?

277
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,934
Heiji Hattori?

278
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:59,134
Are you saying that you're going to solve the mystery

279
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:04,334
of how Mrs. Kawauchi was stabbed here this morning?

280
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,834
Yes, exactly.

281
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,234
Before that...

282
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:14,134
If possible, I'd like you to bring along the owner

283
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:16,634
of the of the mysterious footprints that left

284
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,934
from the backdoor over here with you.

285
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,234
Of course, I brought him along

286
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:23,534
the owner of the footprints.

287
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:28,534
Shinichi Kudo, it's you.

288
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,034
What's with the blood on your clothes?

289
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,134
Hey, hey...

290
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:35,634
Don't tell me that Shinichi's the culprit?

291
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:38,934
Of all the footprints left in front of this house,

292
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,234
if you exclude the footprints of us

293
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,134
who have an alibi because we were back at the inn

294
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:45,834
and those of Mrs. Kawauchi,

295
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,834
the only footprints left would be his.

296
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,634
Blood of the victim is splattered on his clothes,

297
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,234
his fingerprints are on the murder weapon...

298
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:54,334
No matter how you look at it, he's the murderer.

299
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,334
That's true.

300
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,334
Because he is the killer.

301
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,834
In other words,

302
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,434
no trick was used in committing the crime.

303
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:17,434
What?

304
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:19,434
Heiji.

305
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,334
What are you up to?

306
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,934
Is this some kind of strategy?

307
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,534
It's not a strategy.

308
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:28,634
I'm saying that this guy called Mrs. Kawauchi out by phone

309
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,634
and stabbed her.

310
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,534
Hold it.

311
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:41,734
You insisted this morning that he'd never stab anybody.

312
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,734
I... I was scared.

313
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,634
That newspaper reporter said that

314
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:51,834
she'd expose the blunder that I made a year ago.

315
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,534
She threatened me saying that she'd shatter the fame

316
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,134
and pride that I'd established up to now.

317
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:04,534
I didn't know what it was about, but...

318
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:08,234
I was so scared that I inadvertently...

319
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,934
Who is he?

320
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:24,134
No. He's not Shinichi.

321
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:26,934
The Shinichi that I've be waiting for is...

322
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,034
The person that's been filling my heart.

323
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,334
The Shinichi that I've been longing for is...

324
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:48,534
It's just as you say, Kazuha.

325
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,834
I can't...

326
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,934
I can't stop my tears from falling.

327
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:06,978
Did you really call the newspaper reporter, Mrs. Kawauchi here

328
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,478
and stab her?

329
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:11,978
Yes. I did it.

330
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:15,578
I just can't believe it.

331
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:19,878
Your deduction a year ago was fantastic.

332
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:21,678
You saw through the trick in the wink of an eye

333
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:26,078
and paved the way to solving the case with lightning speed.

334
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:28,878
Why would a person like you, do something like this?

335
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,678
You're over evaluating me.

336
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,478
I'm not God.

337
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:37,878
I hate people and make mistakes too.

338
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,578
It seems that a year ago

339
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,878
I wrongly made a culprit out of Mr. Hinohara

340
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:47,278
who was innocent.

341
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:53,278
Maybe you don't remember because you've lost your memory.

342
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,478
But as far as that incident is concerned, there was legitimate evidence.

343
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:56,678
Excuse me.

344
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:00,178
The test results have been reached

345
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:02,078
so I thought I'd report it.

346
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:03,178
Test results?

347
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:06,278
That boy from Osaka asked me to get it.

348
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:10,078
He asked me to check if the murder weapon knife

349
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:13,578
and the piece of chain inside the lucky charm pouch that the boy had

350
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,878
matched or not.

351
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,078
And, what about the result?

352
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,878
Just as you said, they didn't match.

353
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:26,878
All right! It's just as I deduced!

354
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:29,678
You mean that lucky charm, right?

355
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,678
What does it have to with the knife?

356
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:35,378
What on earth didn't match?

357
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:39,978
It's what all humans are bestowed with

358
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,878
from the heavens when they are born,

359
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:44,878
an emblem that stays with you till the end of your lifetime.

360
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,878
Since there is no one with the same,

361
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,878
when it comes to criminal investigation,

362
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:56,678
it is considered to be one of the most reliable evidence.

363
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,478
Fingerprints, isn't it?

364
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:01,478
Yes.

365
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:04,878
Who is he?

366
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,178
Death?

367
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,278
Stand back.

368
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:14,778
A gun?

369
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:15,778
No use.

370
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:29,978
Cut it out.

371
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:33,178
Enough with the costume party already.

372
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,078
Costume party?

373
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,878
What're you talking about?

374
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:41,978
Yes. If any trick was involved in this case

375
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,278
it's his face.

376
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,278
I mean it's unthinkable that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

377
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,078
would ever stab anybody.

378
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,278
The first thing that bothered me was

379
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,078
the attitude that Mouri's daughter took.

380
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,878
Despite the Kudo she'd been waiting for all this time

381
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:03,078
appearing before her,

382
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,578
she acted as if she didn't know him and displayed a cold attitude.

383
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:08,078
Normally, she would've clung to him and not let go, right?

384
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:13,178
And the more so, if he has amnesia,

385
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:17,178
at first I thought she was just hiding her embarrassment,

386
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:19,978
but after I checked the hut of the culprit in the forest, I found out why!

387
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:21,578
Culprit's hut?

388
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:24,578
Yes, the pictures of Kudo that are pinned up on the wall

389
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,678
were all slashed to pieces,

390
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,878
and a great number of mirrors were cracked

391
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:30,578
with the shattered pieces scattered over the floor.

392
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:35,178
There could be only one reason that the guy who hates Kudo to the point

393
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:39,178
of slashing his pictures would crack mirrors to pieces.

394
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:43,978
He couldn't stand seeing the face of Kudo

395
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:46,478
that was reflected in the mirror.

396
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:50,178
Don't tell me that...

397
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:54,478
Yes, he underwent plastic surgery

398
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:57,878
and changed his face to that of this green-horn detective...

399
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:05,678
stupid high school detective.
