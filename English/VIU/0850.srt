1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:02,607
Yumi of the transportation department,

2
00:00:02,608 --> 00:00:05,707
threw the important envelope she received from Master Haneda

3
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:08,407
away with her trash!

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:13,707
Luckily, the manager of the condo had retrieved it for her, but...

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,307
By the way, what I want to ask you

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,707
is about the stuff that was stuck between the pages of the magazine

7
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,407
that I threw out as trash this morning.

8
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:21,907
Is this it?

9
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,807
You... Don't tell me...

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,208
"Shukichi Haneda" -You looked inside the envelope?

11
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:29,007
Why should you care?

12
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,107
You threw it out as trash, anyway.

13
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,007
You old fart!

14
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:34,907
But all is well!

15
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,707
Since the content is really a marriage registration form!

16
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,107
Give it back to me!

17
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:41,907
On the registration form for the husband's employment field,

18
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,807
it showed seven crowns title holder professional shogi player.

19
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,707
I can tell that he filled out that form

20
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,807
with extraordinary resolution and determination!

21
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,707
I know that.

22
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,207
But in this championship match,

23
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,908
Taiko is really having a tough time.

24
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:03,308
If Taiko were to lose this Osho Title match...

25
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:08,307
This marriage registration form that indicates "7th Crown Holder"

26
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:10,307
would become invalid!

27
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:13,707
So you know where the envelope is, don't you?

28
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,707
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

29
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,907
Show me your resolution then!

30
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,907
Resolution?

31
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:26,607
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

32
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,507
How resolute you are about that!

33
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,207
Hey, maybe this is it?

34
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,208
What?

35
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:36,107
It says to insert the 8-digit password.

36
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:40,207
Moreover, it says only Yodogimi is authorized to enter the password!

37
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,907
Then, what shall we do?

38
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,407
It's easy!

39
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:47,207
We need to find the 8-digit number some place in this room

40
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,907
and if Yumi enters it into the computer,

41
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:52,007
we'll be able to locate where the envelope is.

42
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:56,507
Isn't that right, meany old gramps?

43
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:57,807
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,907
Now that we know, let's all look for it!

45
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,807
Aye...

46
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,807
However, although we searched the entire room,

47
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,407
all we found was

48
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:11,707
one piece of paper with mysterious code like things on it.

49
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,207
What is this?

50
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:17,907
Are they figures or letters or symbols?

51
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,308
Gosh. I can't find a clue.

52
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,807
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

53
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,107
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

54
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,107
Decipher the super difficult code.

55
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,307
Where will the thoughts of the couple settle?

56
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,007
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,107
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:48,708
His name is Detective Conan!

59
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:22,716
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 2)"

60
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:25,255
That's right.

61
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:27,255
I heard from Miike

62
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:29,155
that you made her drive the mini police car of MPD

63
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:31,755
all the way to the Yamanashi Prefecture?

64
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,655
That's right. Because Chukichi said that

65
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:37,555
he wasn't going to make it in time for a certain match.

66
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,955
But you're fantastic, Mr. Haneda.

67
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,155
Today was an important day of a match for him

68
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,655
and yet he stood it up just for you, Yumi.

69
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:47,955
What match?

70
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,355
I had a Meijin title match to attend to today.

71
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,855
Meijin title match?

72
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:54,455
Where at and at what time?

73
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:58,955
That is, if I can get to the Yamanashi Prefecture's Tokiwa Hotel by 3:00.

74
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:01,855
But there's less than an hour and a half to go, so...

75
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:05,856
Chukichi, don't take this car lightly.

76
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,055
Hey! That Benz over there!

77
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,356
Change lanes and open the way!

78
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:16,255
Stop dilly dallying and move it!

79
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,455
Yumi, you're taking it too far!

80
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:22,855
Thinking back, it must've been a shogi match.

81
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,855
Do you know Tokiwa Hotel?

82
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,455
I wonder.

83
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,555
The Tokiwa Hotel in Yamanashi is the tournament hall

84
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:33,055
where Meiji Match was held for the 7th Crown title that Master Taiko won.

85
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,155
I heard that he made it just before his time was up,

86
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,655
but I didn't think he got there on a police car.

87
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:43,355
And it was great that he got to the tournament hall

88
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:46,455
but Chukichi got panicky saying that he lost my picture

89
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,656
that he was keeping as a good luck charm.

90
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,855
So, I kissed him and sent him off.

91
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:54,956
With a great big smack.

92
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:01,455
I thought that she was Chacha,

93
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,056
but maybe...

94
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,555
Look, look.

95
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,455
I did it!

96
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,555
How many moves can I make?

97
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:12,455
10,000?

98
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,455
The game will end if you move that many!

99
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,655
They're bored of searching

100
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:21,355
and started playing Mawari Shogi.

101
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,955
Well, we searched quite a bit, but can't find anything

102
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,955
so I guess it can't be helped.

103
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:31,355
Which means, this one piece of paper is the only code there is.

104
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:35,455
By the way, don't you think that this room is a bit cold?

105
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:36,955
Yeah.

106
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:39,955
Gramps, will you turn on the heater, please?

107
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:44,155
The thing is, I'd like to if I could,

108
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:47,455
but the air conditioner's been broken from yesterday.

109
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,955
It won't move at all.

110
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,155
I'm sorry, but you've got to put up with the cold.

111
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:53,455
What?

112
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,055
When we first came into this room,

113
00:06:56,056 --> 00:07:00,255
it was a bit warm so I'm sure that the heater was on.

114
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:03,756
Then, why is this old man hiding the fact?

115
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,655
Hey.

116
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:10,455
Is this a code that you thought up to begin with?

117
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,355
Yeah, that's right.

118
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,755
Why do you ask?

119
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:18,455
Because this code is a copy and not directly written!

120
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,455
What? Is that right?

121
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,255
Shoots! I took a photo of it right away

122
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,555
so I didn't check the original out.

123
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:32,555
So, I'm asking if you copied the code from someone who wrote it?

124
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:36,855
That's 100% what I wrote.

125
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,356
I copied it just for the sake of it.

126
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,555
No.

127
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,655
Just by the looks of it, there is no copy machine in this room.

128
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,255
In order to make a copy,

129
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:50,755
he would have to walk over to the convenience store

130
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:53,355
about a 10 minute walk from here.

131
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:57,055
Moreover, the paper of copy machines are rectangular.

132
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,955
In order to make it into a square like this paper with the codes on it

133
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:02,455
you'll have to work on it manually.

134
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:05,655
He didn't copy it just for the sake of it.

135
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:09,455
He had no choice but to copy it.

136
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,055
But, what on earth could the reason be?

137
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:15,355
Maybe he didn't want anybody to see the draft?

138
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:19,455
He didn't want to show the parts that he fixed with white out?

139
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,155
Or...

140
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,455
If you really made this code,

141
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:27,755
why don't you give us a hint? You know, a hint!

142
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,955
Even if there's no hint,

143
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:35,255
if you are determined to become man and wife with Master Taiko,

144
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:38,955
you'd be able to decipher the code right away!

145
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:43,656
If you have the resolution to become a true married couple.

146
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,156
A married couple?

147
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,255
One again.

148
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,655
I almost goaled, and then...

149
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:56,255
You had a good start, though.

150
00:08:56,256 --> 00:09:00,255
Well, life is full of ups and downs!

151
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,056
Ups and downs...

152
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,255
Wait a sec.

153
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:11,355
That code was in the wastebasket, right?

154
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,455
Then, if that paper with the code on it

155
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,356
is shaped into "that" form...

156
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,255
Will you lend it to me?

157
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:21,955
Hey!

158
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,255
Conan?

159
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:26,556
Maybe you came up with something?

160
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:31,055
Why would he? He's just playing!

161
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,955
But in his case, I don't think so.

162
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,355
See? Look at him!

163
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:38,655
Does he look like he's deciphering a code?

164
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,355
I guess not.

165
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:44,356
Isn't this origami that we used to play with when we were children?

166
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,055
What?

167
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:58,355
Fantastic! It's a letter!

168
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:01,555
Then, Yumi! Key in the 8-digit number!

169
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,855
Okay! Let's see.

170
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,355
But...

171
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,455
That's not a number.

172
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,655
It's katakana, isn't it?

173
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,155
No problem!

174
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:16,055
Most adults can remember the 8-digit number if they see that.

175
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,155
-Yeah. -What?

176
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:21,955
Moreover, the code is not only what I just showed you.

177
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,056
It's a pair.

178
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:28,155
Hey, Miwako.

179
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,855
Is this correct?

180
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,555
Probably.

181
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:36,755
Then, I'll click the ENTER key and input it.

182
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:39,055
Wait!

183
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,955
Let's try and confirm it on the internet just in case.

184
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,355
What?

185
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:45,155
Just one mistake

186
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,755
and it seems we won't be able to find the envelope

187
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:49,955
with the marriage registration inside.

188
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,055
I guess so.

189
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:55,955
Wow! It's just as Ai said.

190
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,555
Yumi entered the 8 figures really smoothly!

191
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:02,555
And the code was Katakana, too.

192
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:05,155
I wonder how that Katakana appeared

193
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,555
when you folded the paper with the code on it, in the first place?

194
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,855
You had no hint and yet.

195
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:12,155
I had hints.

196
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,855
What?

197
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:17,755
The hints were that the paper with the code on it was deliberately copied

198
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:21,656
and that it was found in the wastebasket.

199
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,026
A copy?

200
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:35,427
What would've been apparent if he didn't make a copy?

201
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:41,250
Like a draft or corrections made with white out?

202
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:44,550
Then, take this sheet with the code that I just folded.

203
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:47,851
What disappears when you make a copy?

204
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,950
I get it!

205
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:55,450
The folding lines!

206
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,650
Right!

207
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,350
-The folded lines? -Really?

208
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,450
Yeah!

209
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:03,650
If there were creases on the paper to begin with,

210
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:07,650
we would've know right away how to fold the paper.

211
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,150
But on the other hand, with no creases,

212
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,950
we wouldn't know how to fold it.

213
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:16,250
That's why this code was in the wastebasket!

214
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:17,450
What?

215
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,450
Did he try to throw it away?

216
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,650
No.

217
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,350
There's an old proverb that goes...

218
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,850
"A crane in a dump heap."

219
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:28,850
It refers to someone exceptionally talented

220
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,651
or beautiful mixed among a group of people of little account.

221
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,150
Exactly!

222
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:38,250
A dump heap is a place where you dispose of trash.

223
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:41,350
Since this code was in the wastebasket,

224
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,550
it's telling you to fold a crane with this.

225
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:49,751
So if you fold it into a crane, with the code facing up...

226
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:56,650
See? This is what you get.

227
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:01,050
The word "root" and "number 5" appear!

228
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:04,050
What's "root 5"?

229
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,150
The number you square to get 5

230
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,650
is called the square foot of 5 or root 5.

231
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:11,750
But when most people get to be an intermediate or high school student,

232
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:15,650
they're taught to memorize the first 8 digits!

233
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,250
Eight whole digits?

234
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,650
That's too much to memorize!

235
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,050
Nothing to worry about.

236
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,550
There's a phrase to remember it by!

237
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,650
A rhyme to help memorize?

238
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,050
For root 5,

239
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,550
you memorize, "A parrot cries at the base of Mr. Fuji".

240
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:34,250
Which will help you come up with the numbers 2.2360679!

241
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:37,850
So, if she enters the 8 digits...

242
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,050
Yep, that seems to be correct!

243
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,850
Okay, here goes!

244
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,350
What?

245
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:49,150
Enter the other 8 digits?

246
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,250
Root 5 wasn't the only password?

247
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:53,750
Don't worry!

248
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,150
All we have to do is fold another crane with the same sheet!

249
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,151
What?

250
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:02,951
The old man who made this crane gave the hint married couple!

251
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,650
So first, we fold it back to this shape

252
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,750
with the small overlapping squares

253
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,450
and fold here like this.

254
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,750
Then, you just fold the crane in the same way as when you started.

255
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:19,751
Then a symbol like root 5 should appear.

256
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,750
This time it doesn't look like Katakana.

257
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:30,650
There's a strange drawing on the back, too.

258
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:34,150
The symbol on top of the circle is the square root symbol,

259
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:38,250
so I think we need to figure out what number goes into the circle.

260
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,650
But the only hint is this queer drawing.

261
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,850
Maybe it's a 9?

262
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,750
Why do you think so?

263
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,150
If the circle on top is the moon

264
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,650
and the thing underneath is a sake cup,

265
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,350
it could be signifying moon viewing, right?

266
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,950
Right. And moon viewing is in September

267
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:58,550
so you think that the number to be placed in the circle is a 9.

268
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,450
But the square root of 9 is 3,

269
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,150
so it's not 8 digits.

270
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,450
Really? So, I'm wrong?

271
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,450
My father always says, he wants to enjoy a drink (Ippai)

272
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,950
while gazing at the moon.

273
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,450
A drink? (Ippai)

274
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,550
I see.

275
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,351
So that's it!

276
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:35,151
Shall we begin the post match discussion?

277
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,850
What? Sonant marks?

278
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:45,450
You mean the two dots that are on the upper right corner

279
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:47,450
of the sake cup sonant marks?

280
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:48,550
Yeah!

281
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:50,350
What's a sonant mark?

282
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:53,050
It's a mark that is used to change the sound of a character.

283
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,850
Huh?

284
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,450
The "ge" in your name is pronounced that way

285
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,350
because a sonant mark is added to the character "ke", right?

286
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,550
Oh, that!

287
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:04,551
But how does that help you decide what goes into the circle?

288
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,950
Then, try counting from 1!

289
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,251
What?

290
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:10,650
How do you count fingers?

291
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:14,750
Ippon, nihon, sanbon, yonhon.

292
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,150
What about mice?

293
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:20,550
Ippiki, nihiki, sanbiki, yonhiki.

294
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,850
And drinks?

295
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:25,751
Ippai, nihai, sanbai, yonhai.

296
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,250
You got it already, right?

297
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,350
When counting, what number is marked with sonant marks?

298
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:32,750
The number three!

299
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,550
Bingo!

300
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,450
I guess you enter root 3.

301
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,451
What?

302
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:43,250
Well, root 3 is "Treat me like you'd treat anybody else",

303
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,251
so it's 17320508.

304
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,250
"Treat me like you'd treat anybody else."

305
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,551
Okay!

306
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:57,950
Hey, what's this?

307
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,250
The screen just switched to

308
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,150
what's being captured by the camera on the computer!

309
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:05,950
Where's the envelope?

310
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,251
Take a good look!

311
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:11,451
Take a good look...

312
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,251
The envelope's in my chest pocket!

313
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,050
All right!

314
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,650
I see.

315
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,250
When Yumi bumped into you at the entrance,

316
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,750
you used your pickpocketing skills

317
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:30,950
to hide the envelope in Yumi's chest pocket.

318
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,250
That's why he turned off the heat

319
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:36,450
so that she wouldn't take off her jacket.

320
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:39,450
Chukichi's marriage registration is mine!

321
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,450
The Osho title match

322
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,550
is being held at the Jinya Inn in Kanagawa Prefecture.

323
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,350
It seems that they'll be on lunch break till one in the afternoon.

324
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,850
If we take a cab, we can still make it in time!

325
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,250
Yes.

326
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,550
A phone call?

327
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,751
From Chukichi?

328
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,450
Hello?

329
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,650
Chukichi?

330
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:03,350
Hey, you're not supposed to be using your cell phone now, are you?

331
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,550
It's okay.

332
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,551
What do you mean, it's okay?

333
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,250
The match is over.

334
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,750
It's over?

335
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:22,550
So, please throw that envelope away.

336
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,350
It's meaningless already.

337
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:29,750
What? What do you mean? Throw away the envelope?

338
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,450
Oh, no! Bad news!

339
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:35,950
They're reporting online that Master Taiko lost the Osho title match!

340
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:37,351
What?

341
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,850
Let's see.

342
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,350
Apparently worried about something other than the match,

343
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,050
Master Taiko made one poor move after another

344
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,951
and lost the match before lunch, it seems.

345
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,850
But, Chukichi...

346
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:59,450
I'll keep to my initial intention.

347
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:05,150
This was the motto of my brother-in law, Koji Haneda

348
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,750
a shogi player that I really respected.

349
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:11,150
Koji Haneda?

350
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,150
I'm sorry, Yumi.

351
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:17,651
Men don't like to go back on their word.

352
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,651
Is that so?

353
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,651
What?

354
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,450
Yumi.

355
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:37,550
You...

356
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,350
I don't know what you put into that envelope.

357
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,250
But if you have something you want to say to me,

358
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,650
say it to my face!

359
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,750
If you ever get your seven or eight whatnots

360
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,850
and become the king or whatever...

361
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:55,250
Then, at that time... I guess I, the great Yumi

362
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,851
will have no choice but to hear you out.

363
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:01,350
So...

364
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:04,050
Until then, don't you dare lose to anyone!

365
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,050
You balding mouse!

366
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,051
Yes, madam!

367
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,750
Yumi, you're awesome.

368
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:18,150
I thought she was Chacha,

369
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,051
but she is Nene after all.

370
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:26,351
I can see him getting henpecked.

371
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,951
Rather, I think that was Nobunaga?

372
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:56,150
What? No.

373
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:59,250
You mean the Osho Title match is only held once every year?

374
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,450
Yes.

375
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:03,950
So the earliest you get to hear Master Taiko to propose to you

376
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:06,650
will be at the earliest a year from now.

377
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:09,550
What? Really?

378
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,650
I thought they had it once a month or something.

379
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:15,950
Beside, Master Taiko is a 6th Crown holder now,

380
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:18,350
but if he loses a title like he did today,

381
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,451
he has to start all over from there again.

382
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:25,351
God knows when your wedding will be, Yumi.

383
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,550
I'll call him right now

384
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:29,950
and tell him that I don't care how many crowns he gets,

385
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,050
so to just stamp a seal on the marriage registration form right now!

386
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,450
Don't! I mean, after you acted so awesome!

387
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:38,150
If they love each other, they should just get married right away!

388
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,550
Yeah.

389
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:43,050
Maybe adults have all kinds of things to think about.

390
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:46,750
Hey. Do you know?

391
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,350
Koji Haneda.

392
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:51,050
Yeah! He was a genius shogi player

393
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:53,850
who was closest to winning all seven titles,

394
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:58,250
but he left for the States to play in a chess tournament,

395
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,450
and during that time,

396
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:02,950
he got involved in some incident and passed away, right?

397
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,250
Since his last name was also Haneda,

398
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,650
I thought they might be related

399
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:11,151
but I didn't think he was Master Taiko's brother-in-law.

400
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,150
What about him?

401
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,250
That name...

402
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,050
I remember seeing it.

403
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,350
What?

404
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:27,150
It was two names below yours on the list of people

405
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:30,051
who were administered APTX 4869.

409
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,350
There's nobody else here,

410
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:52,050
so why don't you come here?

411
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:55,051
Idiot, you're there.

412
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:58,550
Are you all right?

413
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,950
A red ogre...

414
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:01,551
Red ogre?

415
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:08,350
