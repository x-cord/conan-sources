1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:06,508
Thank you for gathering here today, everyone.

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,507
What'd you want to talk about, Mitsuhiko?

3
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:18,247
I've figured out who stole the pudding that came with the pasta meal

4
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:20,898
that I ordered at Tamaki Book Café.

5
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,517
What? You invited us here just to tell us that?

6
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,647
What do you mean by that?!

7
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:29,198
I was really looking forward to that pudding!

8
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:34,198
Mitsuhiko-kun, are you saying one of us is the culprit?

9
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,157
That's right.

10
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,198
Who is it?

11
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:44,207
Recall the order in which we were sitting when the crime took place.

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,077
I, the victim, was sitting at the end of the table.

13
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:50,107
Conan-kun sat next to me, and Ayumi-chan sat next to him.

14
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:55,177
Across from me was Genta-kun, and sat next to him was Haibara-san.

15
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:59,558
In other words, only Conan-kun or Genta-kun could've done it.

16
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,438
It wasn't me.

17
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:06,568
But, Mitsuhiko-kun, didn't you notice when your pudding was stolen?

18
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:11,528
No, because the culprit cleverly directed my gaze away from my pudding.

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,527
How?

20
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,778
Well...

21
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:18,168
Using this!

22
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:25,538
The thief stole my pudding while I was distracted by the train whistle.

23
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,418
Isn't that right, pudding thief Kojima Genta-kun?

24
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:32,468
It wasn't me!

25
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,777
Don't play dumb.

26
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:41,078
The meat sauce from my pasta is on your right sleeve.

27
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:46,108
You probably accidentally got it on you while reaching for my pudding.

28
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:48,858
You can't talk your way out of this one, Genta-kun!

29
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,028
I'm sorry, Mitsuhiko.

30
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:00,038
The eel bowl meal I ordered didn't come with pudding.

31
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,377
But there was a tasty pudding right in front of me.

32
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,248
I couldn't help myself.

33
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,538
Hate the sinner, not the sin.

34
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,378
You should reflect on your actions.

35
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:18,657
M-Mitsuhiko, I'm sorry!

36
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:22,687
I definitely couldn't have solved this case.

37
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,638
Way to go, Mitsuhiko.

38
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:27,267
This case was a piece of cake.

39
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:28,648
After all, I am...

40
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,268
the Great Detective Mitsuhiko!

41
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:47,497
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

42
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:49,627
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

43
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,007
A huge collection of books incites a case!

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,957
An unreadable trick becomes unraveled!

45
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,677
Always determining the one truth

46
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,457
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

47
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,958
his name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,978
"The Whistling Bookstore 3!"

49
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,778
This is pretty well written.

50
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,437
Really?

51
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:44,028
Yeah.

52
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:46,557
The solution is solid.

53
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:50,408
It's impressive that a first-year grade schooler came up with this.

54
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:54,707
Why'd you have to make me the pudding thief?!

55
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,548
I never did that.

56
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:00,617
Who cares? It's my novel.

57
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,397
You're right. This isn't a test.

58
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:04,948
You can write whatever you want.

59
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,098
See?

60
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:09,567
Read mine next.

61
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,478
I wrote a story about eel bowls raining from the sky.

62
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,797
Read mine, too.

63
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:18,867
My story's about shrinking and making friends with dolls.

64
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,527
Eel bowls from the sky first!

65
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:22,757
Dolls!

66
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:24,157
Eel bowls!

67
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,488
Now, now. I'll read them one at a time. Just relax.

68
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,267
What are you writing?

69
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,737
It's a secret. How about you?

70
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:36,288
Huh?

71
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,628
I can't come up with anything.

72
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:44,178
I'm impressed they could.

73
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,527
Sorry for getting in your way, Michiko-san.

74
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:50,138
What?

75
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,857
Oh, it's not like that. It's no trouble at all.

76
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:57,797
I'm the one who invited you here.

77
00:05:57,798 --> 00:06:01,047
I'm just a little jealous.

78
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,028
Jealous?

79
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,738
It's been a few weeks since I started writing novels,

80
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,738
but those kids get far more praise than I do.

81
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,997
Maybe children have an easier time coming up with original stories

82
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,748
thanks to their flexible imaginations.

83
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,757
Flexible imaginations, huh?

84
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:22,447
By the way, Michiko-san, why did you decide to begin attending a writing class?

85
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,727
You're asking me?

86
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:24,378
Yeah.

87
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,367
I've always liked books,

88
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:32,707
but I began reading even more after I started working at Tamaki Book Café.

89
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,768
It made me want to write one of my own.

90
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:38,018
Huh, really?

91
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,717
My goal is to have my own novel on the shelf.

92
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:44,107
No, that's not all.

93
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:48,028
I want to write a best-seller that sells a million copies and win an award, too.

94
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,158
How's it looking?

95
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:55,667
Ah, Nojima-san. Everyone's written solid stories.

96
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,038
I'm glad to hear that.

97
00:06:57,288 --> 00:07:02,727
I'm more interested in having you write a hit novel, Omura-sensei.

98
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:06,548
Otherwise you'll never be able to stop teaching this writing class.

99
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:08,798
Right...

100
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:12,747
Omura-sensei is a real author?

101
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,047
He is.

102
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,557
He's already published three books.

103
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,467
I see.

104
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,697
Who's that man?

105
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:23,068
That's Nojima Ryoji-san.

106
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:25,057
He owns this building.

107
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,777
I heard he's something like Omura-san's sponsor.

108
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,248
Huh.

109
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:32,408
Rubbish.

110
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:38,458
What was that for?! That's my novel!

111
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,947
You haven't got the fundamentals of storytelling down!

112
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,587
I bet you haven't even read the classics!

113
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,347
Now, now, Nojima-san.

114
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,968
You're speaking to a child.

115
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,697
Once someone has taken up the pen, it doesn't matter if they're a child.

116
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:53,508
There will be no half-assed writing in this classroom!

117
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,558
Looks like you need a little educating.

118
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:01,398
I'll show you what a real story looks like.

119
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:04,227
Nagisa-san, we're going down into the basement.

120
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,558
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,038
Wow!

122
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,168
Temperature Humidity

123
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,277
It's even air-conditioned.

124
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,968
He takes really good care of his books.

125
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:37,707
Hey, look...

126
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,027
Be careful.

127
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,728
That book is worth six million yen.

128
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:52,457
You should begin by reading these for reference.

129
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,437
Are these rare books as well?

130
00:08:56,438 --> 00:09:00,108
The cheapest one is worth about a million yen.

131
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:04,208
I'm too scared to read such an expensive book.

132
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,617
It doesn't matter if they get dirty.

133
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,737
Books have value when they're read.

134
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,157
And only first editions should ever be read.

135
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:11,868
But...

136
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,957
Quit complaining and read!

137
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,888
I'm not letting you out of this room until you've read the books I've given you!

138
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:18,638
Okay!

139
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:31,898
Put them back on the shelf when you're done reading.

140
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,887
I'll be upstairs.

141
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,408
Understood.

142
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:55,387
I finally finished.

143
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:58,678
Hey, that's not where that book goes! It goes over here!

144
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,647
And how dare you place it upside down?

145
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,688
Who raised you?

146
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:05,848
Sorry!

147
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,138
Good.

148
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:09,028
Yes, sir!

149
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:13,408
What? Are you hungry?

150
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:14,608
Yeah.

151
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:19,238
I suppose that can't be helped. Nagisa-san, prepare us some lunch.

152
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:21,618
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,618
This looks great!

154
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:26,487
You're right.

155
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:27,998
Let's dig in.

156
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,968
Thanks for the food!

157
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,528
What's wrong?

158
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,768
It's nothing.

159
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,638
I seem to have cut my finger on a book.

160
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,518
I've got band-aids.

161
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,668
Thank you, Ayumi-chan.

162
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:53,537
We'll keep reading once you're finished eating.

163
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:56,977
Nojima-san, these children are still in class.

164
00:10:56,978 --> 00:11:00,778
Do you presume to order me around, thief?

165
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:05,038
H-Hey, don't bring that up here.

166
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:09,468
Silence! How dare a lowly author talk back to me?!

167
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:18,707
Sir, it's not good for your health to get so excited.

168
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,958
Don't tell me what to do. I'm—

169
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,438
Michiko-san?!

170
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,938
Toto University Hospital

171
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,878
Michiko!

172
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:40,598
Are you okay, Michiko?

173
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,448
Ichiro-san...

174
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:46,748
I'm sorry for making you worry.

175
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,717
I'm glad you're all right.

176
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:54,218
I'm fine now. I just wasn't feeling well.

177
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:57,628
Is something wrong?

178
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:04,178
Michiko-san, we just got done speaking to the police and doctors.

179
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,928
The police?

180
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:13,438
Michiko-san, apparently it's possible that you've been poisoned.

181
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,648
What?

182
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,658
Um, Detective Takagi?

183
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:33,538
Is it true that Michiko-san was poisoned?

184
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,787
Well, actually...

185
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,047
Detective Takagi.

186
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:37,928
Yes?

187
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:42,747
We didn't find poison in the food or beverage the victim consumed.

188
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:44,087
Really?

189
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:44,798
Yes.

190
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,977
Then when and how was she poisoned?

191
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,368
Detective Takagi.

192
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,188
Maybe the poison was on a book.

193
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:55,688
A book?

194
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,567
Michiko-san said she cut her finger on a book and sucked on the cut.

195
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,068
Maybe that's when it happened.

196
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:08,357
Well?

197
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:11,827
We didn't find any poison on these books.

198
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:16,418
But we did find a highly-concentrated poison on this one.

199
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:20,597
Then it must've been because she touched that book.

200
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:24,527
Nojima-san, how is this book stored?

201
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:29,428
It was simply left in here, but the entrance was locked.

202
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:32,308
Who has access to this library?

203
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:36,007
Nagisa-san and I had keys.

204
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:42,318
But since we'd unlock it for anyone who asked, Omura-sensei was often in here as well.

205
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,948
That's right.

206
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:48,948
Which means all three of you had the opportunity to poison the book.

207
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:54,587
Come to think of it, wasn't it Nojima-san who handed her the book to read?

208
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:55,208
Yeah.

209
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,857
Really? Is that true?

210
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,458
It's true.

211
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:04,577
Which means, Nojima-san, it's likely that you poisoned her.

212
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:10,907
Wait, wait. I handed out novels as writing references.

213
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,348
But that book is an encyclopedia.

214
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,307
I didn't hand that to anyone.

215
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,783
Omura-san, is that true?

216
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,728
I feel like I've seen that book before.

217
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,577
Yes. It's true that Nojima-san handed out novels.

218
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,337
I see.

219
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,747
Paris green...

220
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:26,358
What?

221
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:29,637
Isn't the color of that book Paris green?

222
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,547
P-Paris green?

223
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:36,038
Yeah. We'd know for certain if we asked an old book expert.

224
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,648
An old book expert?

225
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,048
Well, Tamaki-san?

226
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,077
There's no mistaking it.

227
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,428
Like Conan-kun said, this is Paris green.

228
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:53,428
I knew it. I felt like I'd seen it in an online news story before.

229
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:57,058
So, what is Paris green exactly?

230
00:14:57,228 --> 00:15:02,357
It's the artificial pigment used in this book's binding.

231
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,177
Until the second half of the 19th Century,

232
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:10,577
a powerful poison was used to produce this vivid green color.

233
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,877
What? Poison?

234
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,698
Yes.

235
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:16,367
According to one theory, Napoleon

236
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:21,838
was killed by a poison exuded from Paris green wallpaper.

237
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,338
What? Napoleon?

238
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:27,048
It's just a theory.

239
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:32,267
In other words, the book itself was a poisonous book.

240
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,727
Nojima-san, were you aware of this?

241
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,827
No, that's news to me.

242
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,348
I had no idea it was such a dangerous book.

243
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:45,367
Which means it seems likely that this was an accident that occurred

244
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,608
when the victim unconsciously touched this book.

245
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,867
Come to think of it, Michiko-san was looking at lots of books in here.

246
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,618
Yeah.

247
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:58,118
The question is why did Michiko-san touch that book?

248
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,338
What's this scratch?

249
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:15,748
This is blood.

250
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:20,588
Then Michiko-san must've cut her finger on this book.

251
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,998
But what's it doing here?

252
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,058
What's this?

253
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,598
This indentation... Could it be?

254
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:37,748
I see.

255
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,908
So that's how it is!

256
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,138
Michiko-san, I'm sorry.

257
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:48,548
I had no idea there was a poisonous book in that library.

258
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,507
Don't worry about it.

259
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:53,928
I didn't know it was there either.

260
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,357
I'm really sorry.

261
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:59,157
I know this can't make up for it,

262
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:02,207
but I hope they'll at least make your stay in the hospital less boring.

263
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,188
For you.

264
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,537
Are you sure I can have all of these?

265
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:09,188
Thank you.

266
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,577
We should get going.

267
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,078
Excuse us.

268
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:22,208
Michiko-san, let's keep working on your novel once you're feeling better.

269
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:25,458
Sure. I'll come up with ideas while I'm here.

270
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,208
Bye.

271
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,588
Conan-kun, what is it?

272
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:38,598
Michiko-san, did you touch a German book in that library?

273
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:42,098
What? Yeah, I did.

274
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,608
Why did you do that?

275
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,067
Something caught my attention.

276
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,358
I cut my finger when I did, though.

277
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:54,318
Was the thing that caught your attention...?

278
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,418
Ah, this is it.

279
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,988
I've been looking for this book.

280
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,748
How considerate of you.

281
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:04,998
Damn it.

282
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:08,638
I cut myself on the paper.

283
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,098
Don't lick that!

284
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:12,758
You're the boy from this afternoon.

285
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,797
What do you mean, don't lick that?

286
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,497
Is this book...?

287
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:21,607
No, that book isn't poisonous or anything.

288
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:25,398
But if you lick your finger, what happened to Michiko-san will happen to you.

289
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,037
What?

290
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,148
Right?

291
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:32,398
You rigged the book and poisoned Michiko-san.

292
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,438
Right, Omura Kosuke-san the author?

293
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,937
What are you talking about?

294
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:43,617
I simply found the book Nojima-san was looking for.

295
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,978
Then what's this doing here?

296
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,247
What is that?

297
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,668
A box cutter blade.

298
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:56,178
Omura-san hid this poisoned blade inside the book.

299
00:18:56,438 --> 00:19:00,928
He planned to poison you when you cut your finger removing the book from the shelf.

300
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,097
Since there are poisonous books in this library,

301
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:07,938
he could make it look like an accidental death.

302
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:14,777
Omura! Michiko-san wasn't enough? You had to poison me, too?

303
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,967
You're wrong.

304
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:16,698
What?

305
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:21,078
You were Omura-san's only target.

306
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:27,078
Michiko-san had the bad luck of falling for Omura-san's trap.

307
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:32,208
How did he plan to make me pick up the poisoned book?

308
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,868
Probably by doing this.

309
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:40,218
Nojima-san, you scolded Genta-kun this afternoon, remember?

310
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:43,017
And how dare you place it upside down?

311
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:45,218
Who raised you?

312
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:49,728
By placing the poisoned book upside down...

313
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:52,957
He thought I'd notice and pick it up.

314
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,728
Yeah.

315
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,738
It caught Michiko-san's attention because she works at the book café, so she picked it up

316
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,738
without realizing the book was poisoned.

317
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:16,638
The scratch on the shelf from the blade that was made

318
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,528
when she flipped the book over proves it.

319
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:23,138
But Nagisa-san could've fallen for that trap, too.

320
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,888
That's why he used a German book.

321
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,957
Even if Nagisa-san can't read German,

322
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,647
she'd at least notice if a book were upside down.

323
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,397
There are books from all over the world here, right?

324
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:36,858
Y-Yeah...

325
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,877
When placed right side up,

326
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:44,747
the titles on the spines of American books are read from top to bottom,

327
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:48,108
but European books are read from the bottom up.

328
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,917
Because there are Western books in this library

329
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,227
whose spines are read from the top down and the bottom up,

330
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:58,628
at a glance, it's hard to know which ones are upside down.

331
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,098
I see.

332
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:04,178
But, Omura-sensei, why poison me?

333
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,547
I've always supported you.

334
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,428
Supported me?

335
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,147
Don't be absurd!

336
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:13,348
You've worked me like a dog!

337
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:18,108
I'm sorry for stealing your books and selling them when I was broke.

338
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:23,028
But you worked me like a slave because of that!

339
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:29,288
I had reached my limit.

340
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,958
Michiko-san, you're feeling better.

341
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:03,088
Yes, thankfully.

342
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:05,008
I'm so glad.

343
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,718
Oh, right. I have a present for all of you.

344
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:11,657
Is it snacks?

345
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,538
Judging by the shape, it's probably a book.

346
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:17,387
We've seen this before.

347
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:19,058
Open them.

348
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:23,568
Is it another first edition Sherlock Holmes?

349
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:34,617
I finished my novel since I didn't have anything else to do at the hospital.

350
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:37,268
I took the plunge and self-published.

351
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:43,448
Of course. That would be too good to be true...
