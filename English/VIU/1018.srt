1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:04,373
Kudo

2
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,232
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,412
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

4
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:21,372
Sera's hypothesis and fearless smile!

5
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:23,522
The Akai family closes in on the truth!

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,062
Always determining the one truth

7
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,852
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

8
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:29,653
his name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:14,663
"The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part One!"

10
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,053
What?

11
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,973
You're going to make a fortune off an antique dish?

12
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:24,732
Come on.

13
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,342
Have you forgotten your painful experience with the Persian rug?

14
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,323
I know.

15
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:32,903
That's why I had an appraiser look at it this time.

16
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:37,782
He called to let me know he has my results, so I'm on my way to get them now.

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,283
So, where'd you get the dish?

18
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:47,953
I've taken you kids before to my uncle Agasa Kurisuke's villa.

19
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:49,632
Oh, right.

20
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,713
That villa with the hidden star, sun, and moon code.

21
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,653
That's right.

22
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:58,632
That was before you came here, Ai-kun.

23
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:01,093
Yes, I heard about it from the children.

24
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:06,042
It started as a treasure hunt you set up at the villa,

25
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:09,062
but the code led up into an attic.

26
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,733
They even found a mummified corpse and plates for making counterfeit bills.

27
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:16,733
In the end, they caught the scoundrel who wanted the plates.

28
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,092
That's right.

29
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,993
I found an old wooden board in the back of a shelf

30
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:24,493
when I went to hide the toys for the treasure hunt.

31
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:27,852
Since the handwriting was so nice,

32
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:31,003
I brought it home and put it on display.

33
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:34,332
Just the other day,

34
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,503
I realized it wasn't a board, but a flat box with a sliding lid.

35
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:42,013
I found an antique dish inside.

36
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,513
Huh.

37
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:46,902
My uncle Kurisuke was a wealthy man.

38
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:51,152
I thought it might be a rather valuable antique,

39
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:54,523
so I asked an appraiser I know to appraise it for me.

40
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:59,063
Are you sure it was okay for you to take the dish?

41
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:03,262
Uncle Kurisuke passed away 50 years ago.

42
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:06,422
Aunt Teiko who inherited the villa said I could do whatever I wanted

43
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:10,032
with the things inside the villa.

44
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:15,373
She passed away last year anyway, so it's mine now.

45
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,512
So, why'd you call me here?

46
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:21,383
I'm the one who invited you over.

47
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:25,312
I'd like you to do something about her.

48
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:26,383
Her?

49
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:33,093
That tomboy named Sera Masumi who's watching us from behind the gate as we speak.

50
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:37,383
That's why you had me come in through the back?

51
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:38,773
That's right.

52
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:43,413
If you came in through the front door, she would've come with you.

53
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,203
So, why is she watching this house?

54
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,692
You know, don't you?

55
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:53,592
Well, it's not the house.

56
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,123
It's probably you.

57
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:56,053
What?

58
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,112
Why would she be watching me?

59
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:01,253
Well, a-actually...

60
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,792
What?!

61
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:07,263
She suspects that I've been turned into a child by that drug, just like you?

62
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:09,762
How could you expose our secret like that?

63
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,012
Do you want to die?

64
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:11,763
It's not like that.

65
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,172
Sera's got keen instincts.

66
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:19,903
Apparently she asked Ran and Sonoko if they knew any mature kids besides me.

67
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:24,483
They told her you fit that description.

68
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:30,613
So, do you know any other kinds who are strangely mature for their age?

69
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:34,062
It's got to be Ai-chan, right?

70
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,123
Yeah, Haibara Ai.

71
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,112
She lives at Professor Agasa's house.

72
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:41,342
She's more than just mature.

73
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,063
She's got a totally cool personality.

74
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,462
She's probably got a lot of questions for you.

75
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:53,473
In any case, I don't know what she wants to ask me,

76
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:59,983
but if your so-called "Black Organization" finds out

77
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:03,483
that we've been turned into children by APTX 4869,

78
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,122
they'll kill both you and I,

79
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:12,842
as well as anyone associated with us.

80
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:13,743
Yeah.

81
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,853
I know that.

82
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:25,503
D-Did she get impatient and decide to try a direct approach instead?

83
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:28,713
Hey!

84
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,402
Make her leave!

85
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:32,063
What?

86
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:33,452
Hurry!

87
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:34,303
Jeez.

88
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,813
How am I supposed to make her leave?

89
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,873
Yes?

90
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,372
S-Subaru-san.

91
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:45,522
I received a bunch of cherries from an acquaintance, so I came to share.

92
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:49,252
More importantly, did you see anyone at the gate?

93
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:51,033
Yes, I did.

94
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:53,932
There was a girl wearing a motorcycle helmet.

95
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:54,753
Huh?

96
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,663
Conan-kun, what are you doing here?

97
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:00,163
I came here early this morning because I had something to do.

98
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,713
Oh, really?

99
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:05,213
In that case—

100
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,593
By the way, Professor,

101
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:09,532
how did the appraisal of that antique go?

102
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,843
I was just on my way to get the results.

103
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:17,353
He said he'd show me something interesting he's appraising while I'm there.

104
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,853
Something interesting?

105
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,792
Are you familiar with Chinese black lacquer trays?

106
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:31,742
They're wooden objects painted with layers of black and red lacquer

107
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,163
until they're completely black with patterns carved into them.

108
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:39,793
You mean like the tray that appeared on the appraisal TV show the other day?

109
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,913
I think it was worth 100 million yen.

110
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:45,422
100 million yen?

111
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,293
That's right.

112
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:49,872
Apparently three people saw that program

113
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:53,173
and realized they had similar trays at home and asked him to appraise them.

114
00:07:53,803 --> 00:08:01,943
Surprisingly, all three trays have exactly the same crane design on them.

115
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:07,212
Does that mean of the three trays, two of them are fake?

116
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:12,442
Exactly. He said the real tray would be worth several tens of millions of yen.

117
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,802
He invited me to come watch him explain the difference

118
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,272
between the real tray and the fakes to the people who hired him.

119
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:20,373
I see.

120
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:26,373
In that case, would it be all right if I accompanied you to this appraiser's house?

121
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:31,042
I'd like to see that black lacquer tray for myself.

122
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,722
S-Sure, that's fine.

123
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,383
What will you do?

124
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,013
I think I'll pass.

125
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,893
I'm not interested in antiques.

126
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:42,893
What?

127
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:48,043
So I'll watch the house for you, along with that girl.

128
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,153
You're not interested in old trays either, are you?

129
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,243
So that's her angle.

130
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:57,032
I'm... I'm going with the professor!

131
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,163
I love old trays!

132
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,612
Then maybe I'll go, too.

133
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,162
After all, it's worth several tens of millions of yen, right?

134
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:08,173
Suddenly I'm interested.

135
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,232
Then why don't all five of us go?

136
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,542
I-I suppose.

137
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:18,893
That's that. I look forward to spending time with you, Ai-chan.

138
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:26,092
Come on, we're both girls. There's no need to be so cold.

139
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:27,963
Hey, Subaru-san.

140
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:29,553
Come with me.

141
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,662
Why did you invite Sera?

142
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,362
Sorry, kid.

143
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:41,623
I couldn't allow her to continue behaving suspiciously at the gate.

144
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:43,673
Besides...

145
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,493
There's something I've been wanting to ask my sister.

146
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,003
Hey, the character for "Ai" in Haibara Ai means sadness, right?

147
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,483
That's a little unusual, isn't it? Did your parents choose that?

148
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:03,873
It looks like she's asleep.

149
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:15,273
Excuse me. Nishitsu-san!

150
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,473
It's Agasa, here for my appointment.

151
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,793
Nishitsu-san!

152
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:28,283
Maybe his hearing aid is acting up again.

153
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:32,752
I'll go get him. Wait there.

154
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,043
Understood.

155
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,263
Nishitsu-san.

156
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,922
By hearing aid, did he mean the "Deaf Angel" he made before?

157
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:42,843
Yes.

158
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,692
The Deaf Angel works fine at first,

159
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:48,792
but quickly develops issues and it becomes difficult to hear anything.

160
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:51,442
Like they say, names and natures often agree.

161
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,692
"Names and natures often agree?"

162
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,432
You know some difficult phrases.

163
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,693
Yes, is there a problem?

164
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,213
Now she's fighting back.

165
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:05,793
High quality lacquer has been applied in layers.

166
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,782
It's truly exquisite.

167
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:13,813
There are probably people who would pay 80 million—no, 100 million for this.

168
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:18,932
I asked you to wait in the other room.

169
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,093
What's the matter?

170
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,792
Did you call me?

171
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,593
In that case, I must apologize.

172
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:29,103
It seems my hearing aid is acting up again.

173
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,912
More importantly, take a look.

174
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:35,603
Look at its dignified and magnificent appearance.

175
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:39,473
This is the real black lacquer tray.

176
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,483
Unfortunately, it's not the one you brought.

177
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,813
No...

178
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,123
However...

179
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,503
That's my tray!

180
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,803
Excuse me.

181
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,683
Nishitsu-san.

182
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,902
It's Agasa, here for my appointment.

183
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:12,373
Nishitsu-san.

184
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,822
Nishitsu-san.

185
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,693
Where are you, Nishitsu-san?

186
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,443
Nishitsu-san.

187
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,493
Nishitsu-san?

188
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,283
What happened?

189
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,353
Who did this to you?

190
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:31,783
Th-This... this is the real tray...

191
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:34,623
The real tray?

192
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,253
Wh-What's this?

193
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:39,943
A crane design?

194
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,623
Must be the black lacquer tray he mentioned.

195
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,053
In any case, we need to call an ambulance and the police.

196
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,553
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

197
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:54,033
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

198
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:18,333
What?

199
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,713
He was bleeding from the head and lying on the ground?

200
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,122
The appraiser?

201
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:25,362
Yeah, with the black lacquer tray right in front of him.

202
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:26,303
Did you call an ambulance?

203
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,352
The thing is, I left my phone in the car.

204
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,992
Haibara, call an ambulance and the police.

205
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:32,723
Got it.

206
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,183
Take that turn. It's the second room from the end.

207
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,443
That's the room.

208
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:45,863
What's this?

209
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,103
It's no use. He's dead.

210
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,233
Hey, Conan-kun.

211
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,002
I don't see a tray anywhere.

212
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,583
What?

213
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,133
What's going on here?

214
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:05,193
You're making quite a lot of noise.

215
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:07,923
What's wrong?

216
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,842
Who are you?

217
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:17,452
You're not scoundrels here to steal my tray, are you?

218
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:19,523
If you're outsiders, could you please leave?

219
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,573
He lost a lot of blood from his head.

220
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:34,942
There's also a rather deep stab wound on his back.

221
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,833
According to the coroner,

222
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:40,062
the cause of death was most likely aortic injury

223
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:44,042
due to the stab wound in his back inflicted by a pointed bladed object.

224
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,782
Pointed bladed object?

225
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:46,633
Yes.

226
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:51,803
The weapon was almost certainly that spear closest to us over there.

227
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:54,452
The culprit's fingerprints weren't on it,

228
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:57,342
but there's blood on the tip of the blade.

229
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:01,313
There are also marks on the metal base that were made when it was used to strike something.

230
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,703
I see.

231
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:06,042
Judging by the fact that the victim Nishitsu-san was still alive

232
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:12,573
when Agasa-san first came to this room around 2PM today,

233
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,573
after knocking down the victim with the spear,

234
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:21,253
the culprit probably hid inside a wardrobe since Agasa-san arrived.

235
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:25,753
And after Agasa-san left the room to call the police and an ambulance,

236
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:29,462
using the spear they used to knock him down,

237
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:32,413
they finished him off by stabbing him in the back.

238
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,093
By the way, Agasa-san, what are you doing here?

239
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:40,672
I asked Nishitsu-san to appraise an old dish for me.

240
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,922
I came to hear the results.

241
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:46,863
I brought some friends who happened to be at my house.

242
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:50,682
If you asked him to appraise something, does that mean...

243
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,283
Yes.

244
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:55,283
The victim Nishitsu-san was an antique art appraiser.

245
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:59,832
But why would someone kill an antique art appraiser?

246
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,672
Probably because of the black lacquer tray.

247
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:04,793
Black lacquer tray?

248
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:06,023
Yes.

249
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,902
It's a type of Chinese lacquerware.

250
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:12,303
Apparently he was asked to appraise one worth several tens of millions of yen.

251
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:15,502
Agasa-san said the tray was in front of the victim

252
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:21,103
as he was bleeding from his head and barely breathing in this room,

253
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,103
but that tray is no longer there.

254
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:28,762
Perhaps that means that's what the culprit was after.

255
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:34,113
Actually, if that black lacquer tray is in that box over there...

256
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,873
This tray here.

257
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:42,243
Then it hasn't been stolen.

258
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,243
See the two similar boxes next to that one?

259
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:48,633
Why don't you take a look inside those?

260
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,482
Seriously?

261
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:57,673
All three contain the same tray.

262
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,952
What's going on here?

263
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:03,322
He happened to receive three requests to appraise trays

264
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,722
with the same pattern at the same time.

265
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:09,612
Because a similar black lacquer tray

266
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,903
was appraised at 100 million yen on an appraisal TV show.

267
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:13,653
100 million yen?

268
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,093
This tray is worth that much?

269
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:20,913
Apparently the victim said he'd explain the difference between

270
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:26,663
the real tray and the fakes to us and the three clients who hired him to appraise them.

271
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:31,923
It's natural to think there's a culprit who killed the appraiser,

272
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:38,173
and put the real tray in their own box

273
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:44,143
in order to get their hands on that fortune among you three.

274
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,842
I see.

275
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:48,353
Then one at a time, why don't you tell us

276
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,922
your name, profession,

277
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:55,233
and what you were doing where around 2PM when the murder took place?

278
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,743
My name is Tojima Motoyuki.

279
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,063
I'm a salaryman at a securities company.

280
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,873
I realized there was a tray identical to the one seen on the appraisal TV show

281
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:12,772
in the storage shed I inherited from my father, who passed away last year,

282
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:14,503
so I hired an appraiser.

283
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:19,413
I thought it'd be nice if mine were worth that much.

284
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,842
So you wanted to sell your tray for money.

285
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:27,042
I don't have any money problems.

286
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:30,103
There's just nothing better than having a nest egg for after retirement.

287
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,733
What were you doing where around 2PM?

288
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,502
Nishitsu-san said his professor friend would be arriving soon,

289
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:41,922
so he asked the three of us to wait in this reception room.

290
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:45,472
I went to the bathroom, but got lost since this house is so large.

291
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,403
I wandered around for a while.

292
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:53,083
While wandering around, I heard them running down the hallway,

293
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,133
so I went to that room.

294
00:18:57,463 --> 00:18:59,763
We're talking about 100 million yen!

295
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,723
I bought that tray 20 years ago for 100 million yen!

296
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,692
Mine's obviously the real one!

297
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:09,973
C-Could you tell us your name and profession first?

298
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:12,393
Chono Kinji.

299
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:16,693
Until ten years ago, I was the president of a real estate company.

300
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,233
Now I'm retired.

301
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:23,203
What were you doing around 2PM?

302
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:27,282
I was in this reception room with this woman for a while,

303
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:30,643
but sitting still isn't for me.

304
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,362
I went to the study and was absorbed in reading about old works of art when, like him,

305
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:42,142
I heard someone noisily running down the hallway and headed there.

306
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,433
I see.

307
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:47,743
In any case, mine is the real black lacquer tray.

308
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,672
If that tray is fake,

309
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:54,063
I'd be too embarrassed to face my family.

310
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:01,573
I am Sakamaki Suzue. I am the director of the Furuito Art Museum.

311
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:07,573
I brought the black lacquer tray that has been on display at the museum for many years.

312
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:12,112
We wanted to make that tray the main attraction

313
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,793
of our reopening after the museum's remodeling.

314
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:20,702
The museum owner asked me to confirm the piece's value,

315
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,553
so I hired an appraiser.

316
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:27,582
We're curious to know if it's worth as much as the tray seen on the TV show.

317
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,553
I see.

318
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:37,062
I never dreamed there would be two other people with similar trays.

319
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:40,233
You were in this reception room around 2PM?

320
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,682
Yes, alone.

321
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:45,993
At first, the housekeepers were here with me.

322
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:49,813
This home has housekeepers?

323
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:55,273
Come to think of it, I think I met two when I came here before.

324
00:20:55,903 --> 00:21:00,322
This woman sent them shopping after she said she doesn't like sweet things

325
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:02,222
and asked if they had salty rice crackers.

326
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:04,612
All I did was ask if they had any.

327
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,582
I didn't demand them.

328
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,622
It didn't sound that way to me.

329
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:09,593
But...

330
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:13,522
Those housekeepers just returned.

331
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,702
Apparently they were getting more ingredients for dinner while shopping for rice crackers.

332
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:18,773
I see.

333
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:21,903
Is there nobody else in this house?

334
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:25,533
Normally the son and his wife live here,

335
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,212
but they're currently on vacation.

336
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:30,222
Huh.

337
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,533
I see.

338
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:35,132
In other words, excluding the three of us in the entryway,

339
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,643
at the time of the murder, the people in this house were

340
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:42,903
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost on his way back from the bathroom,

341
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:47,723
Chono Kinji-san who was reading books on antiques in the study,

342
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:54,023
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was alone in this reception room.

343
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:57,732
The three of you could move freely throughout the house.

344
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,733
Any one of you could've stabbed Nishitsu-san to death with a spear.

345
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,582
Since a spear has a long handle,

346
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,993
you wouldn't get much blood on you even if you hit or stabbed someone.

347
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,253
How old are you actually?

348
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:54,823
You took the same thing Conan-kun, didn't you?

349
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,852
There's blood on this.

350
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,553
What?

351
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:01,683
I see. So you're the culprit.

352
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,523
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

353
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,513
There's blood on the backs of all three trays.

354
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:14,083
The next episode of Conan is "The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part Two!"
