1
00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:01,638
Four years ago,

2
00:00:01,638 --> 00:00:03,738
there is a legendary woman driver, Silver-white Witch,

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,938
who drives a white FD that is said to have street raced

4
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:09,338
all over Mt. Fuyuna.

5
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,238
Accident after accident have been occurring to the street racers

6
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,538
because recently the legendary driver has appeared again,

7
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:16,738
challenging the street racers to have a match with her.

8
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:19,538
According to Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

9
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:22,438
that happened to encounter Silver-white Witch,

10
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:26,238
the witch'car sped through on the fog where there is no road.

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,738
And when she got out of the car,

12
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:30,438
she stands on the fog and waves her hand.

13
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,238
Pops who heard about this

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,438
head off early in the morning to Mt. Fuyuna

15
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:39,638
saying that he was going to catch the witch.

16
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,638
The witch's white FD appears

17
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:44,038
on the mountain road enveloped by a thick fog.

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,438
We pursue the witch as Pops goes after her with all his might,

19
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:01,438
but the white FD leaves behind a woman's scream like skidding sound

20
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:04,538
and disappears into the fog.

21
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:06,138
It can't be!

22
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:08,738
This had got to be a trick of some kind!

23
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:10,638
"Checkpoint" -In order to confirm this,

24
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,938
we contacted Inspector Yamamura who was doing a checkpoint search,

25
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:17,038
and asked him to stop all the white FDs.

26
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:22,238
As a result, three FDs and three pairs of drivers were stopped.

27
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:24,538
Is the witch among them?

28
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:29,438
And how did the witch's FD speed along on the fog?

29
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,638
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

30
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:36,238
Saturday nights are for mystery.

31
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,238
Sounds of cars speeding within the fog.

32
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,238
Disclose the true identity of the witch!

33
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:41,838
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:43,738
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,738
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,465
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 2)".

37
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,665
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

38
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,665
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

39
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:38,765
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

40
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,165
thanks to her, though.

41
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:43,365
Were you guys going fishing?

42
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:47,065
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

43
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:51,265
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

44
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,365
And? Is it really true

45
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,865
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

46
00:03:56,865 --> 00:04:00,465
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

47
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:04,465
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

48
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:05,765
Shut up.

49
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,365
Hey.

50
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:10,265
You're sure wearing some ring.

51
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:14,365
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

52
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,665
and I'm still bleeding.

53
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,365
The reason I'm riding a white FD?

54
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,665
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

55
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:25,065
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

56
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,365
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

57
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:33,265
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

58
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:36,865
so I pulled over to the side. And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

59
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:40,265
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

60
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,965
Because there are three golf bags inside.

61
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,565
That's why I thought so.

62
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,565
I'm asking you, who's he?

63
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,465
Well, this boy is...

64
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:52,265
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

65
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,665
Your middle fingernail is gone.

66
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,365
When I shifted gears a while ago,

67
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:00,165
it got stuck and disappeared.

68
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,265
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

69
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,665
is riding a white FD?

70
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,465
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

71
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:10,265
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

72
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:15,665
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

73
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,265
but I don't remember what model car it was.

74
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,365
While drinking coffee in the car,

75
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,565
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

76
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:27,165
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

77
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:31,465
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

78
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,465
Hey, Misao.

79
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,765
Granny!

80
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:39,065
I told you to stay in the car!

81
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:42,165
Back then, the one who got off the car on top of the fog

82
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,465
and waved back at me

83
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,865
had a halo around her.

84
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:52,465
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

85
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:58,365
So, the six of them went home.

86
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:01,265
The witch could've been among them and yet...

87
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:04,565
But the arms of the three

88
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,365
that were sitting in the passenger's seat of each car

89
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:10,465
were not anything like the witch's arm that we saw.

90
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:14,365
Dad also said that she could've really been a witch.

91
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,165
I see.

92
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,565
Oh, right.

93
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,165
I just called because I was a bit concerned.

94
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:23,065
Bye, then, Ran!

95
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:27,365
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge...

96
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:28,665
Come to think of it,

97
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,565
there was a time when you used to get up early in the morning

98
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:33,165
to go there, wasn't there, Miwako?

99
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,465
Yes.

100
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:36,965
Because the hospital that the girl who lost both her parents,

101
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:40,565
and lost her ability to speak because of the incident

102
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,665
was located at the top of the mountain.

103
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:45,465
But after I went to see her several times,

104
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,865
she began to smile.

105
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,465
By the time she was discharged from the hospital,

106
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:53,665
she said, "I'm going to be a police detective like you".

107
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:54,965
Fantastic, don't you think?

108
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,865
And, didn't you see the witch back then?

109
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:02,265
Beats me, because wanted to see the girl as soon as possible

110
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,565
that I wasn't concerned about anything else.

111
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:08,665
Somebody! Please stop him!

112
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,265
A convenience store robbery?

113
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,365
Sorry, Yumi.

114
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,765
Let's go sing karaoke some other time!

115
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:22,965
That car is fast!

116
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:29,265
Yumi, I'm sorry, but I'm doing "that" in a long time!

117
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,465
Huh? Are you serious?

118
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,365
What's going on?

119
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,165
Are they having a car race or something?

120
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,365
Talk about taking it easy

121
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,165
when here we are looking for

122
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,565
and troubled over an unidentifiable sonic witch.

123
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:52,865
Well, I've more or less an idea on who the witch is.

124
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:56,565
It's probably the FD of that person that made a weird remark

125
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,765
but I still can't figure out at all, how the car sped on the fog

126
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:01,665
and the trick of standing outside and waving hands.

127
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,265
Oh, no!

128
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,465
It's 8:50 pm!

129
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,565
Yomiuri TV! Yomiuri TV!

130
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,865
The TV won't switch on!

131
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,865
I pulled the plug out when I used the vacuum cleaner a while ago.

132
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,565
What?

133
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:16,665
You idiot!

134
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,565
The ending song for today's drama

135
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:23,165
is "Midnight Mirage" by Yoko Okino!

136
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,365
Mirage?

137
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:28,165
How can you be vacuuming at an important time like this?

138
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,965
It's because you knocked over the ashtray, Dad!

139
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,265
A phenomenon where the light warps

140
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:34,665
because of difference in density in the atmosphere,

141
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,365
causing the creation of a landscape

142
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,665
that is not there to look as if it really exists.

143
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:42,865
The person who waved back at me

144
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,965
had a halo around her.

145
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,065
Halo?

146
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:51,465
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.

147
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,465
It finished because you were taking your good old time!

148
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,865
It's because you dozed off.

149
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,165
Okay, then!

150
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,665
I think we should go back to sleep again just in case.

151
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:05,865
Because I think we're going to have to get up early tomorrow

152
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:08,865
to go witch hunting!

153
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,365
Witch hunting?

154
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,765
I hope you really know now

155
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,665
from the people that were stopped at the road check last week.

156
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:24,865
Who of the three pairs of drivers is the witch?

157
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,365
But the witch can drive the car on the fog

158
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,965
and even stand on the fog, you know?

159
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,365
Maybe you're under the spell of the witch

160
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,265
and being made to think that way.

161
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,665
It's the arm!

162
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:36,765
Arm?

163
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,665
Last week when we encountered the car of the witch,

164
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,065
there was an arm sticking out of the passenger's seat, right?

165
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,065
A witch's hand that looked as if

166
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,065
it were wearing a bracelet of a ring.

167
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,265
That's how I figured it out!

168
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,965
But arms of the two who were sitting in the passenger's seat of the car

169
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,765
with two men inside

170
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,965
were pretty hairy.

171
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,365
The arm of the woman sitting in the passenger's seat

172
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:57,965
with the two women inside

173
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,265
was quite tanned.

174
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,265
The arm of the man in the passenger's seat of the car with the man

175
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,765
and woman couple inside was big and sturdy.

176
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:08,065
I think it was really different

177
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,465
from the thin, white arm of the witch that we saw.

178
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:15,165
Of course! Because there's a person

179
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,965
who's lying saying that he/she was in the passenger's seat,

180
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,965
when in fact that person was driving the car.

181
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,265
Lying?

182
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:21,665
I see.

183
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:24,265
All the three pairs of people

184
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,165
that say they were driving have thin, white arms...

185
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:31,665
They switched so that they wouldn't be suspected as being the witch.

186
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,465
If so, the one that is suspicious is...

187
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,165
that couple.

188
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,265
The slightly plump man

189
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:42,465
who said that he was in the passenger's seat navigating the driver,

190
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:46,465
when he was actually filling the rubber boat up with air.

191
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,565
He couldn't have filled a rubber boat of that size up

192
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,365
with air with his mouth, that was in the backseat,

193
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,665
while sitting in the passenger's seat.

194
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,565
Yes, he could've

195
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,865
if he used a pump that is used to fill the tires of bicycles up

196
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,865
or an electric air pump.

197
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:02,665
That... that's true.

198
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:06,465
Then, are you saying that it's the pair of two women?

199
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,565
The fake nail of the middle finger of the person

200
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,965
who said she was driving was peeled off, right?

201
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:14,165
So, maybe she hurriedly switched her fake nails

202
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:16,765
that were black to new ones.

203
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,665
That could be,

204
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,565
but since she said that it came off when she shifted gears,

205
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,565
so the fake nail on her left hand could've come off too.

206
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:29,765
Then, don't tell me that the man with the hairy arm is lying.

207
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:32,665
Because he said that when he fastened his seatbelt,

208
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:36,665
he scratched his right cheek with his ring by mistake, right?

209
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,365
The witch's FD is a Japanese model,

210
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,765
so the steering wheel is on the right-hand side.

211
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,165
If he scratched his right cheek,

212
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,465
it would be that he pulled the seatbelt from

213
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,165
on the right-hand side of the driver's seat and fastened it.

214
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,565
Then, the arm of that witch...

215
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,565
I guess you want to say that it was that of the man

216
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,765
who was riding with the hairy man.

217
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:58,565
The pale white and thin man who made his arm

218
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:02,165
look like that of the witch by using accessories and fake nails,

219
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:05,265
but how are you going to explain how they sped on top of the fog

220
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:08,365
and stood on top of it too?

221
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,765
Oh, that's...

222
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:10,765
That's?

223
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,565
Have you figured it out?

224
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,565
Of course not!

225
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,465
It's really strange, isn't it?

226
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,865
Give me a break.

227
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:22,165
I can't say any more than this.

228
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,565
But, then again,

229
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:28,665
I can't put Pops to sleep with the tranquilizer gun while he's driving.

230
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,965
Oh, right!

231
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,065
Come to think of it,

232
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:34,765
the new song that Yoko is singing this time, "Midnight Mirage",

233
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,565
don't you think that it's a weird title?

234
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,065
What?

235
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:41,865
Because you can't see mirages at night.

236
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:45,065
A kid could never figure out what adults are trying to imply.

237
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,565
A mirage is a kind of magic that makes visible

238
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:51,165
something that is actually not there looks like it's really there, right?

239
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:54,665
It's not magic but just natural phenomenon!

240
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:57,565
Maybe the car that was in front of us

241
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,065
that looked like it was speeding on the fog

242
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,865
was actually not there too.

243
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,065
You idiot.

244
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,365
I saw with my very eyes

245
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,065
as the witch's car turned left

246
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:11,465
where there was no road and sped on the fog.

247
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,965
But the only thing you could see

248
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:14,865
was the red tail lights, right?

249
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:18,865
The fog was thick like today back then too.

250
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,465
It was just the lights,

251
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,165
you heard the sound too, didn't you?

252
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,765
The sound of tires skidding along the road.

253
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,265
That's why I steered the wheels to the left.

254
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,665
Huh? What's so funny?

255
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:35,565
Because you were lured by the light right into the trap.

256
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,865
Just like a fish that is lured over by the light of a football fish

257
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:41,465
and eventually eaten.

258
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:43,065
Football...

259
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,365
Football fish, you say?

260
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,665
Right! They had fishing rods with them!

261
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:49,865
If they attached

262
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:53,065
a red light like that of a football fish's on the tip of the rod,

263
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,165
and stick the rod out of the window of the passenger's seat side

264
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,765
just before turning the right curve,

265
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,865
at the same time swaying the rod to the left side,

266
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:01,565
it would probably look like a left turn was made!

267
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:04,165
The sound of the tires

268
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:07,465
could've been recorded on a car stereo or something beforehand too!

269
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:10,665
I thought of a simple trick like that too,

270
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:13,465
but that doesn't explain what's going on!

271
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:16,365
Standing on top of the fog, that is!

272
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:17,365
Right.

273
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:21,265
Speeding on the fog and standing on the fog

274
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,765
are the same tricks that were used by the witch.

275
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:25,065
Because we kept thinking on that line,

276
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,065
we couldn't see through the simple trick.

277
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,565
They couldn't have attached a puppet

278
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:33,465
or something to the tip of the rod and moved it either.

279
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,565
Then, why don't we ask the one who's doing it to solve the mystery?

280
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:39,665
The... the one? Don't tell me that you...

281
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,965
There she is,

282
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,565
the Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge!

283
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,065
It... it's the same as back then!

284
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,465
Sign of a battle!

285
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,465
Darn! You're not getting away from me today!

286
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:04,665
Don't get lured over by the tail lights!

287
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,065
Okay!

288
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:09,065
We're not the only ones today!

289
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:25,129
Darn, pretty good like always, huh?

290
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,329
But today, you're not getting your way!

291
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,313
Talk about fast!

292
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,813
It made a left.

293
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,613
I'm not going to be deceived! Or so it seems...

294
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:42,113
But it actually made a right!

295
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,113
There! Just as I thought!

296
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,313
It's speeding along on the road like it should be.

297
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,513
She's rushing to pull the rod inside.

298
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:56,113
But, no lights were on before that car made the turn, though.

299
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:58,013
Easy!

300
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:00,613
As for the tail lights, if you turn off the light, it'll turn off.

301
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,613
If you use side brakes and drift when making the turn,

302
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,113
even the brake lamps won't go on!

303
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:07,113
Darn!

304
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,313
Why aren't they falling for it?

305
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:12,313
I'll brush them away at the next hairpin curve!

306
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,913
Good! They can't keep up!

307
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,113
I'm going to make them lose us!

308
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,113
What the...

309
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:50,613
Too bad, super hairy witch!

310
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,613
Phooey, what a bummer.

311
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,813
To think that there's a car that's spinning in a place like this.

312
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,613
No, it's just as calculated.

313
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,213
Right, Yamamura?

314
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,513
Oh, yes.

315
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,113
I've been waiting all this time

316
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:07,413
since I received contact from Mr. Mouri telling me to block the road.

317
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:10,713
Well, since I was driving slowly

318
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,613
about 200 meters ahead of your car, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,213
I almost fell asleep part way.

320
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:21,113
You framed us into this.

321
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:23,613
Okay, I'm all ears.

322
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,913
Tell me, why you did what you did?

323
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,313
What?

324
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,213
You wanted to clean this ridge of street racers?

325
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,513
Aren't you guys street racers too?

326
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,613
Yeah, originally,

327
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:41,513
but our friend died of an accident during a race battle.

328
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,213
That's when we quit.

329
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,013
We got annoyed at those guys who continued to race battle

330
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:50,013
as if nothing had happened at all.

331
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,913
That's why we thought up this trick to scare them,

332
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:56,613
hoping to get rid of them.

333
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,213
Taking advantage of the witch that outraced all the street racers

334
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,713
that were here four years ago.

335
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,413
Well, I guess you can call it bettering the world.

336
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:07,213
In fact, thanks to us,

337
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,013
the street racers coming to this ridge have decreased.

338
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:12,613
Hey, do you understand or what?

339
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:16,213
That there are people who are critically wounded because of you?

340
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,713
Yeah, we feel bad about it.

341
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:22,413
By the way, how did you manage to stand on the fog

342
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:24,013
as well as wave back?

343
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:28,013
Yeah, your grandmother said something like that,

344
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:29,813
but we have no recollection of it.

345
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,513
Maybe she was dreaming or seeing things?

346
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,913
Brocken spectre.

347
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,513
The light of the sun seeping in from behind

348
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:40,013
is dispersed by the cloud and fog.

349
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,913
A circle of light that looks like a rainbow

350
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,113
envelopes the silhouette of the person who is watching,

351
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,113
that is, a halo is created.

352
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:50,413
It's a phenomenon that is seen frequently at Mt. Brocken in Germany,

353
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,413
and from this queer spectacle,

354
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:56,213
it has also been called the fairy of Brocken.

355
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:59,113
I... I saw a special program about it on TV.

356
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,913
TV again...

357
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:04,813
Which means the grandma waved to her own shadow

358
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:08,113
and mistook it as someone waving back at her.

359
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,813
Well, at any rate, I'll have one of my men come get your car,

360
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,613
so will you two please get in my car and come with me to the station?

361
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,013
Let me go get my wallet then.

362
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,713
Yumi?

363
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,913
No, as for the witch, we just caught her now!

364
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,813
Huh? It's not here.

365
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,413
Hey, look over that side too.

366
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,313
That bastard!

367
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,013
No, you mean he fled?

368
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,913
Hey! Did you write down the license plate number?

369
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:44,313
Oh, no.

370
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,613
I was going to do that after reaching the station.

371
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:51,313
Darn! They know this ridge by heart.

372
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:53,113
I wonder if we can catch up with them!

373
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,113
Huh?

374
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,713
That car...

375
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,513
It can't be...

376
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:04,413
Hey, are we going to be all right, fleeing like this?

377
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,513
Yeah, I mean after all, that officer looked dense too.

378
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:10,513
Besides, I'm on parole right now.

379
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:13,513
If they find out that I'm involved in something like this...

380
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,713
Woman's scream?

381
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:19,413
Idiot. It's the sound of tires skidding!

382
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,813
Hey, speed up!

383
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:27,513
It's catching up with us!

384
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:31,013
No, the speed of the car coming from behind is ridiculous!

385
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,713
If I press on the gas more than I am now...

386
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:37,613
Darn! They're right behind!

387
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,313
Hold it! I know this sound!

388
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:44,213
I tried to copy it and listened to it repeatedly,

389
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:45,913
which after I worked on the mufflers and tires,

390
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,213
trying to come up with the same sound, but in vain.

391
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,813
It... it's the witch's scream!

392
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,213
Yes, this is the police station!

393
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:10,713
Pull over to the side and stop the car!

394
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,213
-Police? -Police?

395
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,613
Officer Sato!

396
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,013
What?

397
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:51,413
The witch that appeared four years ago was officer Sato?

398
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,813
Is that for real?

399
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:56,913
Yes, she was not at all aware though.

400
00:22:56,913 --> 00:23:00,313
She didn't even know that her car was a FD either.

401
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:03,913
But Officer Sato's car's not white, is it?

402
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,613
She changed the color of her car

403
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:10,613
because some time in the past, a car hassled her at that ridge and it spun.

404
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,813
She thought that white is a difficult color to see in the fog.

405
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,813
But, did Officer Sato's car sound like that?

406
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,713
Yeah, it sounds like someone screaming.

407
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:23,713
That's Miwako's habit.

408
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,913
When I want to drift and make a curve without pulling the side brakes lever,

409
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:41,713
it seems to go well when I scream as I do so!

410
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,913
It's a bit embarrassing, though.

411
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,513
That's what she told me!

412
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,613
She really screamed.

413
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:53,613
No wonder it sounds like a scream.

414
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:55,113
No doubt.

415
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:58,613
"Next Episode."

416
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:02,013
That's Kayo who was taken hostage!

417
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:04,213
Unless I find out whether he has a gun or not first,

418
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,413
it's too dangerous and my hands are tied.

419
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:14,113
Dad, Conan is in trouble!

420
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:17,713
There's still on suspect left, isn't there?

421
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:21,113
It's you, Mr. Kaneyama.

422
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,513
Next Conan,

423
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:26,513
"Two Days with the Culprit (1st Day)".

424
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,574
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:45,774
"Gun".

426
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:46,774
What's our next episode?

427
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:49,474
Conan is going to hang out with the culprit for two days!

428
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:50,774
What does that mean?
