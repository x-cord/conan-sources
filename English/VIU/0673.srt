1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:05,358
A mysterious case begins with what seemingly looks

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:09,655
to be a simple request through the website of the Detective Agency.

3
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:13,255
Don't tell me that...

4
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:18,355
What?

5
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:25,255
The man who confined Ms. Kei Kashizuka,

6
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:27,855
who had come to the detective agency to talk about her request,

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:31,655
committed suicide right before her eyes.

8
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:36,755
We give Kei a lift home after she finishes going through interrogation,

9
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:40,155
and find many wiretaps set up there.

10
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:44,055
While everyone continues looking for wiretaps,

11
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,755
I left the condo together with Kei

12
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,955
who said that she was going out shopping,

13
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:00,155
was given juice laced with a sleeping drug,

14
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,255
and put to sleep!

15
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:06,355
Ran, who finds out about this, contacts Doc

16
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:09,455
and decides to have him come after me using the pursuit glasses.

17
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,855
However, since Doc's Beetle was out for repair,

18
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,355
they decide to pursue me together with Subaru Okiya,

19
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:18,155
who just happened to be there on his car.

20
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,855
Masumi, who also hears of this,

21
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,855
decides to join Ran and the others but...

22
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:27,955
Welcome.

23
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,455
Fill it up, regular.

24
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,455
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,555
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

26
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,155
Sure.

27
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,155
Go into the station and it's to the right beyond.

28
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:56,655
Thank you.

29
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:12,255
The vivid colored memories of summer

30
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,255
solve mysteries all season round.

31
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,055
Conan Edogawa is kidnapped.

32
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,355
The culprit is surprised at his detailed deduction.

33
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:19,955
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,055
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,555
His name is Detective Conan.

36
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:10,577
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Deduction)"

37
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,792
They've started moving again.

38
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,117
This time they're going south along Ooishi Highway

39
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:17,117
and headed in the direction of Toriyacho.

40
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:18,517
Roger.

41
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,917
I don't think we'll be able to catch up with them for a while yet.

42
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:25,217
But, I wonder where the culprit is headed for?

43
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:28,317
It kind of looks like she's driving around lost.

44
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:31,817
Maybe she's actually lost.

45
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,017
Not being able to find

46
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:37,717
the blood smeared destination that she's searching for.

47
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,317
Darn!

48
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,017
The computer is locked.

49
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:48,617
You can't open it unless you have the password.

50
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,517
Seriously.

51
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,217
Why would anyone do something so humbug like this?

52
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,517
Then, maybe we should try something

53
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,517
that would rhyme with Kei Kashizuka.

54
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,917
Well...

55
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:03,817
How do you two handle your passwords?

56
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,517
My birthday...

57
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:09,017
As for me... (it's Kogoro-san in figures-5563)

58
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,817
No... I mean when it's a very long password

59
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,817
that is hard to remember.

60
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,217
I key it in to the memo pad of my cell phone.

61
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,817
I would write it on a piece of paper

62
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:24,017
and put it in a place like this, that no one would see.

63
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,917
I found it! I got the password!

64
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,717
Fantastic, Dad.

65
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,817
Just as would be expected of you!

66
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:36,417
The number you have called is switched off

67
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,917
or out of service range.

68
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,617
What's going on?

69
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,517
Why aren't any of the three answering?

70
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,717
Would you like me to find her?

71
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,117
The woman that you're looking for.

72
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:52,417
Kid? How come?

73
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:56,517
Oh, I didn't drink the juice with a sleeping drug in it

74
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:57,917
that you bought for me

75
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:01,717
because I spilled half of it under the seat.

76
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,617
I did that because when I opened the cap,

77
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:05,817
it didn't have the sound that cap's have when the bottle is newly opened.

78
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:08,417
That's because you opened it once,

79
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,217
and put something inside the bottle, right?

80
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:15,017
At any rate, if you want to look for the people you're after,

81
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:18,517
we should go meet them in person!

82
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:21,017
The three people you were calling on the phone just now,

83
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,817
are registered on the internet,

84
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,017
so we can find their address right away.

85
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,817
You want to kill the woman, don't you?

86
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:31,017
Serina Urakawa.

87
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,117
Why do you know my name?

88
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,317
I found out through the scratched up cell phone

89
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:38,517
that you're holding right now!

90
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,617
There wouldn't be so many scratches on it

91
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:43,417
unless you handle it roughly on a daily basis

92
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:46,917
or carry it around in your pocket with other hard things.

93
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,617
In the pocket of the coat that you covered me with just a while ago,

94
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,817
there were only that cell phone, a wallet,

95
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,717
and the case for sleeping pills.

96
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:59,117
There were no scratches on the wallet or the case.

97
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,317
Which means that's actually the cell phone

98
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:04,317
that belonged to the man who was found dead

99
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:06,317
in the restroom of the detective agency,

100
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,417
and you switched it with the cell phone

101
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,017
that you brought along with you, right?

102
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,717
That man had a lot of loose change in his pocket,

103
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,617
and though the lighter and the wallet he had inside together

104
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,217
were all scratched up,

105
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,517
there were no scratches on the cell phone.

106
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,317
The stun gun was inside too,

107
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,817
but there were no scratches on it either.

108
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,417
You brought that along with you too, didn't you?

109
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:30,017
Don't be silly. You saw too, didn't you, kid?

110
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,117
That I was tied up with masking tape.

111
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,717
How could I ever switch my own cell phone

112
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:39,517
for the one of the man who was threatening me with his gun?

113
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:43,417
It's easy to tie yourself up with masking tape!

114
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,917
After pulling out the tape,

115
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,717
you hook the hole in the middle of the roll of masking tape

116
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,717
onto the doorknob of the restroom.

117
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:56,017
And after pulling it taut you wrap yourself around with the tape.

118
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,817
The masking tape was wrapped onto you from your elbow up.

119
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,717
So you could use both hands.

120
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:02,217
After cutting the tape,

121
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:04,417
you could remove the tape from the doorknob.

122
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,717
If you use your mouth,

123
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,917
you could wrap the tape around your wrists too.

124
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,517
Then are you saying

125
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:14,217
that I shot that man to death?

126
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,417
The light turned green.

127
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:25,117
I think it's too difficult for you to understand, kid.

128
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,917
But on the hands and sleeves of the person who fires a gun.

129
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,217
There is gun residue.

130
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:35,317
When a gun is fired, lead, tin, antimony, barium,

131
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:39,317
and nitrite scatter in all directions and they stick on to the clothes

132
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,417
and body of the one who fired the gun.

133
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,617
You probably made the man that you attacked with the stun gun

134
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:47,417
hold the gun in his hand, put the gun barrel in his mouth

135
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,817
and made him sit on the toilet seat.

136
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:53,117
Then you unlaced the shoelace of your boot,

137
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:57,017
and pulled in through the trigger from the backside of the man's hand,

138
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,717
then you pulled the shoelace through the inside

139
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:03,817
of the toilet seat to the outside and let it hang down.

140
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:06,617
After that you covered your head with a towel

141
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,417
to avoid getting gun residue on you.

142
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,817
Then, you wet one end of the other towel

143
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,217
and placed it below the grip

144
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,617
so that the gun wouldn't slip.

145
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,817
Next all you had to do was,

146
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,317
cover the shoelace that is hanging out of the toilet seat,

147
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,717
and you're all set.

148
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,917
After sending mail to Detective Mouri

149
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,717
telling him to virtually keep out of the restroom,

150
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,517
you held your boots down with your knees while pulling the shoelace.

151
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:32,117
The gun would be fired,

152
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,517
and by the impact, the man would lurch backwards towards the wall.

153
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:39,017
If you remove the shoelace and towel before we ran into the restroom

154
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:41,817
after hearing the gun shot,

155
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,217
it would look like the man who brought you into the restroom,

156
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:48,317
was cornered and shot himself to death.

157
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:50,317
As proof of this,

158
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:53,517
when Amuro asked you about the cause of your older brother's death,

159
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,417
you didn't answer right away, right?

160
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:00,217
By the way, how did your older brother pass away?

161
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,717
What was the cause of your brother's death?

162
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,617
Yes.

163
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:08,917
That's because your right eardrum is damaged,

164
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,817
and you can't hear clearly

165
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,817
when talked at from the right side.

166
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,817
When firing a gun,

167
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,617
if you bring your left ear close to the man's lap,

168
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:23,017
you can guard it, but you can't protect your right ear.

169
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:25,517
In other words, Kei Kashizuka who called to ask Pops

170
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,917
to look for the locker that the key belonged to

171
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,217
was that man.

172
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:34,117
And the one who came to the Mouri Detective Agency

173
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,917
after luring Detective Mouri out of his office

174
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,717
and acted as an employee of the agency

175
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:42,117
to welcome the man was you.

176
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,117
I guess you were planning to lure the man out

177
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:48,117
to another place in order to interrogate him,

178
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,417
but since he was about to figure out you weren't an employee of the agency,

179
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,617
you had no choice but to pass him out using the stun gun.

180
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,017
But, it was impossible for you

181
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:59,617
to carry that man out to another place alone.

182
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,517
Although you could've taken the man's cell phone

183
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,117
on the spot and kill him,

184
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,417
you figured if the people of the neighborhood

185
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,517
heard the gun shot and came rushing over

186
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,617
you wouldn't be able to flee even if you wanted to.

187
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,017
So you dragged the man to the restroom

188
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:14,617
and set up the trick you carried out a while ago, right?

189
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:18,117
By doing so, you figured the police would let you go for the time being,

190
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,517
and you could use the cell phone you took from the man

191
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:23,617
to search that for the person you were after.

192
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,217
What's with you?

193
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,917
Who are you anyway?

194
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,917
Conan Edogawa.

195
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,415
A detective.

196
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,156
Detective?

197
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:38,277
Look, look ahead, it's a red light!

198
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,992
Then, you figured out what my name was,

199
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,792
because you saw the cash card in my wallet?

200
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:53,392
Nope. I didn't know it was your card.

201
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,292
But, I found out a lot after checking the internet.

202
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,692
In order to make everybody believe

203
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,192
that the cell phone you stole from the man was your own,

204
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,692
you forwarded just one picture to use as the standby display

205
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:03,692
for the man's cell phone.

206
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:07,392
The man in the standby display was Kenya Shono,

207
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:11,792
the bank clerk who was killed by the bank robber the other day.

208
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,992
I also figured that you're probably

209
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:17,892
looking for the three robbers.

210
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,492
Hidden under the bed of the bedroom of Mr. Kashizuka's condo

211
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:27,192
that you took us unwillingly to...

212
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,792
the small framed man that was found there

213
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,692
was also one of the robbers.

214
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,992
The second one was the man of hefty physique

215
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:38,192
that died at the detective agency, called Kei Kashizuka.

216
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,492
And, it seemed that you,

217
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,392
by using the contact list in his cell phone that you took,

218
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:46,192
were trying to look for the third skinny robber.

219
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:49,592
The three people you kept trying to call

220
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:52,192
all had women's names.

221
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:55,592
The fact that you knew there was a woman among the robbers back then

222
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:58,592
means that you were at the crime scene that day.

223
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,292
You probably figured it out

224
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,792
by watching their gestures and physiques at close range.

225
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,792
It hasn't been disclosed to the mass media yet

226
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:11,092
that there was a woman among the bank robbers, you see.

227
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:14,692
Since you were at the site, I'm sure you realized too.

228
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:19,192
That when Kenya said, "Okay, don't!"

229
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:24,992
He was actually saying, "Oh, Kei, don't!"

230
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,292
Yes.

231
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,992
Kenya realized that his friend Mr. Kei Kashizuka

232
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:33,692
was among the robbers, and tried to stop him.

233
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:36,292
But was silenced by Kei instead.

234
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,392
When I checked that cell phone a while ago,

235
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:41,792
I found Kenya's home phone number listed too,

236
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,392
so it's no mistake that the two were friends.

237
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:46,292
Since Kenya was a teller,

238
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,392
he may have leaked information to Kei

239
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:52,892
that 200 million yen was going to be brought in on that day at that time

240
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:55,992
when he was under the influence of alcohol or something.

241
00:13:55,992 --> 00:14:00,192
And I guess that was used to carry out the bank robbery.

242
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:04,692
I called Kenya's parental home and asked them,

243
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:08,992
"Does Kenya's girlfriend still happen to be there?"

244
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,292
Then I was told that.

245
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,892
If the person I'm talking about it Serina Urakawa,

246
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:17,692
she hasn't even attended the funeral last night.

247
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:21,192
Hold it! How do you know I'm his girlfriend?

248
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,892
I told you I was his younger sister.

249
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:25,392
The fact that you were at the site of the robbery,

250
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,592
it's highly probable that you're also a bank clerk.

251
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,192
In order to prevent unlawful acts,

252
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:34,592
it's impossible for relatives to work at the same bank.

253
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:36,592
That's how I found out the truth

254
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,992
that you are Mr. Kenya Urakawa's girlfriend,

255
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:44,292
who's trying to find the three in order to avenge his death.

256
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,992
Hey...

257
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,292
Isn't this the scheme plan of the bank robbery

258
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,592
that occurred the other day?

259
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:06,092
They even audaciously have a picture of the three holding guns too.

260
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:08,592
No. Isn't the man in the middle the one

261
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,092
who committed suicide at the detective agency?

262
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:14,592
The man at the extreme right is the one who was found in the suitcase!

263
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,192
Then, could the woman on the extreme left

264
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,892
be the other bank robber?

265
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:24,392
It seems that the men were exchanging mails with that woman.

266
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:25,392
Yeah.

267
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:29,992
Using an outrageous title like, "Is the gun ready?"

268
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,392
The woman sent mail saying she's moving.

269
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,992
The address is written.

270
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,492
Let's go over.

271
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,092
Yeah.

272
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,292
Well, I found out right away that the Serina Urakawa

273
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:46,092
was a bank clerk when I checked the wallet.

274
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:49,792
Each time a bank clerk is transferred to another branch,

275
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,492
they are told to open a new bank account

276
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,292
which requires no service charge at the new branch

277
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,692
that they are transferred to.

278
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,592
From here, it's just my imagination.

279
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,492
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

280
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,792
you checked the address of Kei

281
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:10,592
using Kenya's address book and went to visit him, right?

282
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,892
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

283
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:17,592
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in, and you were greeted at the door

284
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,192
by a small framed man who was living with him.

285
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,592
Unluckily, you found his gun,

286
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:26,092
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

287
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:28,892
he attacked you in order to silence you,

288
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:32,892
but was beaten to death by you instead.

289
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:37,592
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return,

290
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,192
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

291
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,792
being made in the living room,

292
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,492
so afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

293
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,892
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

294
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,792
and set up wiretaps.

295
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,992
Doing so, you figured that the smell from the corpse

296
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:55,092
would be discovered and the other accomplice would be called over too.

297
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,692
You didn't go to Kenya's funeral

298
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,392
because after setting up the wiretaps,

299
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,792
you were listening to them right through

300
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,192
from your car that was in the parking lot, right?

301
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,292
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

302
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,992
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

303
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:15,292
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

304
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,492
So he called the other robber and suggested

305
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:21,092
that they take the rest of the money and split.

306
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:24,292
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

307
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,092
he didn't know where the locker was.

308
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:30,692
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

309
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,492
So, Kei Kashizuka

310
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:36,792
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

311
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,792
look for the locker.

312
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,892
Of course he said nothing of the contents of the locker.

313
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,992
You, who were listening to the telephone conversation

314
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:48,392
between the robbers over the wiretap panicked.

315
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,492
If Detective Kogoro Mouri finds out

316
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:54,492
that Kei Kashizuka is the bank robber and is arrested,

317
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,992
you would lose the chance to take revenge.

318
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,792
That's why you ambushed Kei Kashizuka at the detective agency

319
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,492
and tried to ask about the other accomplice.

320
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,592
Am I more or less correct?

321
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,192
Yes, that's right.

322
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:13,692
I thought if I checked the call history on this cell phone,

323
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,692
I could find out who that man talked to last night,

324
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:21,992
but he was cautious and had erased all the call history.

325
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,592
If so, then we've got no choice

326
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:27,492
but to visit the three women that you were making calls to.

327
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,592
First, I guess we start from the nearest place.

328
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:31,992
Ms. Rinko Toyokita's apartment.

329
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:36,292
Maybe the woman who kidnapped Conan,

330
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,592
in order to avenge Mr. Shono's death

331
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:41,492
headed over to that woman's place?

332
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,092
Yeah.

333
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:56,592
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

334
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,592
Yeah.

335
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:01,392
What is it? What a nuisance.

336
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:04,992
We moved to this apartment today.

337
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,792
Right, Mom?

338
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:10,092
This isn't much.

339
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,392
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

340
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:14,092
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

341
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:17,092
and is normally asleep at this time,

342
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:19,592
so please be careful next time.

343
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,592
Oh, wait.

344
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,592
Something smells good.

345
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,192
-It's omlette! -Hey.

346
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,392
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

347
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:28,392
Don't you ever come here again!

348
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,292
They've started moving.

349
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:37,592
Judging from the speed, it seems like they're in the car again.

350
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,192
They're headed in the direction of Haido-cho now.

351
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,292
But, I wonder why they got off the car?

352
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,792
I wonder if the culprit took Conan out of the car

353
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,392
and took him around somewhere?

354
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:54,892
No. Maybe Conan is the one taking the culprit around.

355
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,592
I wonder if no one's home?

356
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,592
Oh, my.

357
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:06,292
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

358
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,792
Look at all the brand name packages.

359
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,792
Uh. We've come to say hello since we moved here.

360
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,292
Oh, is that right?

361
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,492
But, you don't have to do that

362
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:18,592
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

363
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,992
Why?

364
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,392
I won the lottery.

365
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,992
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

366
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,892
Oh, that's right.

367
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:32,192
I hate to trouble you, but will you go throw this away for me?

368
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,592
But, it seems that in this area,

369
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,992
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

370
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,492
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

371
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,192
Thanks for your help.

372
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:45,292
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

373
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:50,092
Oh, no. I got mail from Conan.

374
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:54,392
"I'm fine, so don't worry", he says.

375
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:58,092
It seems that he went along on his own initiative.

376
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,092
That brat.

377
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,192
Acting like a detective again.

378
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,592
Well, the curiosity of a child

379
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:09,092
and the inquisitive mind of a detective are quite common.

380
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,992
Yes, who is it?

381
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:21,292
We just moved here today,

382
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,892
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

383
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,692
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

384
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:27,592
I don't accept things like that.

385
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:30,792
Hey, what do you do?

386
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,192
I'm a writer.

387
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:35,292
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

388
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:39,492
All she eats are beef bowls.

389
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,892
Oh, right.

390
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:44,192
Will you do me a favor?

391
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:47,992
Could it be that... You want us to take the trash out for you?

392
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:53,292
This is all of it.

393
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,392
Did you figure anything out?

394
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:57,892
Hey...

395
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,392
So, how about it?

396
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,492
Did you figure out who the robber is?

397
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:27,292
Yep, of course.

398
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,992
But, I can't tell you who it is.

399
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,692
What do you mean?

400
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:34,092
Why not?

401
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:37,992
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

402
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,392
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

403
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:47,392
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,492
It's very unlikely that Conan will be hurt

405
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,392
in anyway just yet.

406
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,992
But, if her purpose

407
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:59,492
is to kill the rest of the robbers...

408
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,692
Didin't you hear what sounded like a gun shot just now?

409
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:09,792
It's that car! Conan is in that car.

410
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,392
Next Conan,

411
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:15,492
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"
