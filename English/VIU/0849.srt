1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,440
I'm stuffed!

2
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,140
That Italian restaurant was good, wasn't it?

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,640
Yep! But I think you ate a little bit too much, Yumi.

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,140
What's wrong with cutting loose on my day off?

5
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,040
I'm a little upset too, besides.

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,640
About that envelope you mentioned

7
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,740
back at the restaurant that your boyfriend gave to you...

8
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:30,240
He's my ex! My ex-boyfriend!

9
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,640
He forced an envelope into my hands several years ago!

10
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,840
Yeah, really... You're late.

12
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:41,440
Here.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,241
What's this?

14
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:49,340
Hey.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,740
Please don't open it until I get all seven.

16
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,040
That's why I'm asking you what is it.

17
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,540
When I get all seven, I'll call you.

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,241
Promise.

19
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,840
That's what he said.

20
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,640
It seems that he got all seven.

21
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,740
But our days off didn't match at all

22
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,840
so I figured, forget it!

23
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,840
Maybe the content of the envelope

24
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,540
was a marriage registration or something.

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,340
What?

26
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,840
Nah, it can't be.

27
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:21,740
You know, in most cases...

28
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,340
He has his name already written in on the form.

29
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,040
If you agree to marrying him, he asks for you to write your name in.

30
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,540
I don't know what the seven are,

31
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,240
but he asked you to keep it safely, right?

32
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,340
Yes, I guess.

33
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,240
What kind of guy is he?

34
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,840
What does he do?

35
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,440
The thing is, he hasn't told me!

36
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:44,140
He told me that he'd call me when gets a hold of all seven.

37
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,540
He seems to be a master of something, though.

38
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,740
Well, it's probably just something like fishing, games or Rakugo!

39
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:52,341
Rakugo?

40
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,340
It's Master Taiko!

41
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,240
Everyone wants him in their commercials

42
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,640
and quiz shows these days.

43
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,140
Master?

44
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,740
You mean of Shogi?

45
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,541
Yes, of course.

46
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:11,440
Don't tell me your boyfriend is...

47
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,841
Master Taiko?

48
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,140
I... I guess so.

49
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,440
Then, by get all seven,

50
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,140
he was referring to the seven major shogi titles!

51
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,140
Really?

52
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,940
Why didn't you open the envelope?

53
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,240
He told you to open it after he got hold of all seven, right?

54
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,540
I was thinking to open it in front of him when I met him next.

55
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,541
And if something not worth it was inside,

56
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,940
I was going to tear it to pieces.

57
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:40,040
And? Where's that envelope?

58
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,440
I thought I saw a glimpse of it the other day.

59
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,140
Oh, right!

60
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,240
I stuck in between the pages of a fashion magazine!

61
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,540
And where's that fashion magazine?

62
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,140
Since it's already outdated,

63
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,340
I bunched it up with some other books and left it at the trash dump.

64
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,340
Then, let's go get it right away!

65
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,340
We could probably still make it if we go now.

66
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,140
Never mind already.

67
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,141
What?

68
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:04,740
I haven't even thought about marriage yet.

69
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,440
Besides, I don't want him to think that

70
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm flimsy woman who changed my attitude

71
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,340
because I found out he was a shogi master.

72
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,941
Well, if you say so.

73
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,940
Although it's none of my business, what a shame.

74
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,640
Holding all seven titles

75
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:25,541
would earn him at least a hundred million yen a year.

76
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,941
Seriously?

77
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,840
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

78
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:47,040
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

79
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,040
The marriage registration is in the recyclable trash?

80
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,040
It won't be easy to find.

81
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

82
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

83
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:57,141
His name is Detective Conan!

84
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:31,533
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 1)"

85
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,971
You gotta be joking, right?

86
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,371
It's gone already!

87
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:41,171
My 100 million yen!

88
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:44,271
So, that's what she disappointed about.

89
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,971
Well, you could tell him the truth

90
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,871
and have him fill in another marriage registration form!

91
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,271
No way.

92
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:53,371
Because Chukichi's stubborn is an odd way, you know.

93
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,071
When I dated him before,

94
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,971
I jokingly asked him if he would give me a spare envelope

95
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,171
just in case I lose the original.

96
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,471
No! There's only one of it in this entire world.

97
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:03,871
There's no such thing as a spare!

98
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,772
That's what he told me.

99
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,771
Wait!

100
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,471
The trash collection truck

101
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,171
should still be going around the city, right?

102
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,671
If I ride the mini police car and sound siren,

103
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:16,971
maybe I'll be able to stop the truck.

104
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,372
That's an abuse of police authority.

105
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:23,871
It's Officer Sato and the mini police car lady!

106
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,171
What's up?

107
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,171
Are you working on a case?

108
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:28,371
Brats.

109
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:32,471
Right! Yumi threw something really important out with her trash.

110
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:33,571
It's a really grave incident!

111
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:35,171
Miwako.

112
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:37,971
-Really? -How stupid.

113
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,071
If it's something important, don't throw it away!

114
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,871
I didn't do it deliberately.

115
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:45,471
You threw it in the trash without thinking?

116
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,371
I had it stuck between the pages of a fashion magazine,

117
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:48,671
so I bundled it up with all the other magazines

118
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,071
and brought it out here!

119
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:54,371
But it looks like today's not the day to throw away recyclable trash!

120
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,971
-What? -Like always, scatterbrain.

121
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,271
Talk for yourself!

122
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:03,871
But the bundle of magazines isn't here,

123
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:08,671
so maybe the manager of this condo stored it elsewhere.

124
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:09,971
What?

125
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,871
If he could tell it was yours,

126
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:15,072
he would probably put it back in front of your room, maybe.

127
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,172
There it is!

128
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,171
I'm glad!

129
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:25,071
He's a hardworking manager, isn't he?

130
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,471
He even posted a paper saying that the day for recyclables is Tuesday.

131
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:31,171
I'm sure I stuck it in between.

132
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:36,471
It's amazing how the manager knew that this bundle was Yumi's.

133
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,071
If you work for a long time as a manger,

134
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:41,271
maybe after a while, you know

135
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,271
what kind of magazines certain residents buy and stuff.

136
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,071
Yumi's probably the only one

137
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,371
who has mahjong magazines jumbled up with fashion magazines.

138
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,571
It's not here! It's not here!

139
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:52,571
It's nowhere!

140
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,171
By the way, what are you looking for?

141
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,671
100 million yen!

142
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,171
What?

143
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,471
Well, you see...

144
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:03,471
Yumi used the envelope with something important inside it as a bookmark

145
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:06,971
and stuck it between the pages of a fashion magazine.

146
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,771
That envelope with the marriage registration inside it.

147
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,871
Yep, most likely.

148
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,371
The children know about it, too.

149
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,571
Was there anything written on that envelope?

150
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:20,271
The word "sealed" was written in the back of the envelope

151
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,671
just where the flap is,

152
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:25,571
and in the front, his name Shukichi Haneda was written!

153
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,171
Then, some woman may have picked it up,

154
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,871
filled her name in on the form

155
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,571
and submitted it to city hall already.

156
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:33,771
Oh no!

157
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,271
Well, if my husband were to be Master Taiko,

158
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,671
my heart would surely sway.

159
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,471
What?

160
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:42,072
Only joke.

161
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:47,771
Let's go see the condo manager and hear him out!

162
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:50,171
Maybe since it's an important envelope,

163
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,872
he could be keeping it for you, right?

164
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,272
Yes?

165
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:03,271
Hello. I'm Miyamoto of room 308.

166
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,971
I have something I'd like to ask you regarding the trash.

167
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,872
Wait up.

168
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:14,671
You've finally come, Chacha!

169
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,071
Chacha?

170
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,771
I told you, don't call me that.

171
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,971
It annoys me.

172
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,971
Hey, Yumi. Just what does "Chacha" mean?

173
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,671
Beats me!

174
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:28,371
When Chukichi came over here some time ago,

175
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:31,271
we ran into him, back then.

176
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:34,771
Since then, he started calling me Chacha.

177
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:38,371
I am absolutely sure that you are a vamp who has smitten Taiko!

178
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:40,171
I see.

179
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:44,371
Do you happen to like shogi, gramps?

180
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:48,171
Yeah. I thought that I was as good as any professional player.

181
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,471
But now, I know I was wrong.

182
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:54,471
Several year ago, I heard that a professional Jr. high school player

183
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:56,871
was coming to an event at a department store.

184
00:09:56,872 --> 00:10:00,271
I figured that he was no more than a green-horn

185
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:03,071
and was all out to beat him to a pulp.

186
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:05,471
However, he in turn beat me hollow.

187
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,971
I fell in love with

188
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,071
his splendid tactics of the way he placed his pieces.

189
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:11,971
Today, I'm a great fan of his!

190
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,871
Each time he wins a title,

191
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,671
I'm as delighted as if it were happening to me

192
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,571
and was living an easy comfortable life.

193
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:21,271
Until I was caught by Chacha here.

194
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,571
Caught?

195
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:26,571
That's right. This old man was a serial pickpocket!

196
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:27,771
Pickpocket?

197
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:31,671
I caught him when he tried to steal my wallet in the train

198
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,671
and threw him into jail.

199
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:35,571
But when he completed his jail terms and was released,

200
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,171
he came saying that he didn't have a job

201
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:40,971
so I helped him get this job as the manager of the condo!

202
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,971
Really?

203
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,571
By the way, what I want to ask you

204
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:47,171
is about the stuff that was stuck between the pages of the magazine

205
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,571
that I threw out as trash this morning.

206
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,171
Is this it?

207
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,071
You... Don't tell me...

208
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:55,572
"Shukichi Haneda" -You looked inside the envelope?

209
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,171
Why should you care?

210
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,271
You threw it out as trash, anyway.

211
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,271
You old fart!

212
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:04,171
But all is well!

213
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:07,071
Since the content is really a marriage registration form!

214
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:10,371
Give it back to me! My marriage registration!

215
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:13,171
I wonder where I put it?

216
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,571
What?

217
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,271
I thought I put it in the bedroom beyond.

218
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:21,572
But I wonder. I'm very forgetful nowadays, you know.

219
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,872
Move, will you?

220
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,672
I'm going to look for it myself!

221
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:49,371
Hey! It's not on the desk nor is it in the drawers, it's nowhere!

222
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:52,071
I wonder. That's strange.

223
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:55,171
I'm sure it's some place in this room.

224
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,871
Well, why don't you have him give it back to you when he finds it then?

225
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,671
Okay.

226
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,171
There's not that much time left.

227
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,071
What?

228
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,671
On the registration form for the husband's employment field,

229
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:10,671
it showed seven crowns title holder professional shogi player.

230
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,471
I can tell that he filled out that form

231
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:15,771
with extraordinary resolution and determination!

232
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:17,571
I know that.

233
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,071
But in this championship match,

234
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,972
Taiko is really having a tough time.

235
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:28,171
The reason is most likely the marriage registration.

236
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,971
Because he hasn't received a reply from the person he really cares for

237
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,671
and cannot concentrate on shogi.

238
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:36,472
That's what he spilled out when interviewed by a magazine.

239
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:40,071
Right, in other words,

240
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:44,772
if Taiko were to lose this Osho Title match...

241
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:49,771
This marriage registration form that indicates "7th Crown Holder"

242
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,071
would become invalid!

243
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,271
What?

244
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,271
Then, call him up right away

245
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:58,371
and tell him, "Let's get married!"

246
00:12:58,372 --> 00:12:59,471
What?

247
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,771
No use.

248
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,771
They don't have their cell phones while at the tournament hall.

249
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:04,772
What?

250
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:08,271
The only time you could meet him

251
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,671
would be when he leaves the tournament hall to go on lunch break.

252
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:14,371
If Chacha goes there at that time with the marriage registration,

253
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,671
he'll gain Herculean strength

254
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,972
and beat any opponent he's up against.

255
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:25,171
There's still an hour to go before lunch break, you know.

256
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,571
So you know where the envelope is, don't you?

257
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,571
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

258
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:34,771
Show me your resolution then!

259
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,771
Resolution?

260
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:41,571
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

261
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,271
How resolute you are about that!

262
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,071
If your feelings are that strong,

263
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:48,272
the envelope should be easy to find!

264
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,739
Resolution?

265
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,639
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

266
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,339
How resolute you are about that!

267
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,139
If your feelings are that strong,

268
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,240
the envelope should be easy to find!

269
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,039
Hey, maybe this is it?

270
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
What?

271
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,039
It says to insert the 8-digit password.

272
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,039
Moreover, it says only Yodogimi is authorized to enter the password!

273
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,339
Yodogimi?

274
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,439
Hideyoshi Taiko's wife, Chacha.

275
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,139
But what're the numbers to be entered?

276
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,339
If you enter a lot number at random,

277
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,239
I'm sure you'll get the correct number in time, no?

278
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,739
No, no! Yumi's the only one who can enter the password,

279
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,839
and it also says that mistakes are forbidden.

280
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,339
If you make a mistake even once,

281
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,940
it'll probably never open again.

282
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,839
Then, what shall we do?

283
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,239
It's easy!

284
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,039
We need to find the 8-digit number some place in this room

285
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,739
and if Yumi enters it into the computer,

286
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,739
we'll be able to locate where the envelope is.

287
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,439
Isn't that right, meany old gramps?

288
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,739
Yeah.

289
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,739
Now that we know, let's all look for it!

290
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,239
Aye...

291
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,839
Okay, let's look for it, too!

292
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,740
Okay.

293
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,639
Genta! Don't turn the wastebasket upside down!

294
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,540
But you never know where it'd be hidden.

295
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,740
What? A strange paper dropped out.

296
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,239
Hey.

297
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
What's this? It's incomprehensible.

298
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,439
But it seems that the thing written on that paper is some kind of code

299
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,939
and if you decipher it, the 8-digit number will appear.

300
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,640
That seems to be true.

301
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,439
Jeez. How do you expect us to solve something like this?

302
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
Well, I guess we'll do okay, right?

303
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,639
Because that code looks a lot like the code

304
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,739
that comes out in Sherlock Holmes' "Dancing Doll".

305
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,239
I'm sure that the Sherlockian who has taken a picture of it

306
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,239
on his cell phone and is staring at it now

307
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,840
has already solved it.

308
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,239
You mean you can't solve it either, Conan?

309
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,939
No joke?

310
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,039
Is it that difficult?

311
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,239
Yeah.

312
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,739
What is this?

313
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,439
Are they figures or letters or symbols?

314
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,139
Gosh. I can't find a clue.

315
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,239
Hey. If you hide it with something,

316
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,239
you might come up with a number.

317
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,239
See! If you hide over here this way,

318
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,739
it looks like the number 1!

319
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,239
You're right.

320
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,540
But, what should we hide it with?

321
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,839
I got it! The shogi piece!

322
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,339
If we place the shogi piece nicely

323
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,439
on top of the paper with the code on it,

324
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,739
maybe we'll find the 8-digit number!

325
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,339
I guess so.

326
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,739
It's strange that this shogi board is here

327
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,339
right in the middle of the room so conspicuously like this.

328
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,439
Yeah, it definitely looks like a clue.

329
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,739
Okay!

330
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,139
Now that we know, let's decipher this code together.

331
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah...

332
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,740
She's got them wrapped around her finger.

333
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,039
Yumi.

334
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,539
Why aren't you answering me yet?

335
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,239
Maybe she doesn't want to marry me?

336
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,639
No, no.

337
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,939
Even so, she would call to let me know of it.

338
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,039
Oops, I shouldn't be doing this.

339
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,540
I've got to concentrate on this match.

340
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,239
Maybe she hasn't opened the envelope yet?

341
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,440
Or, maybe she really threw it away?

342
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,239
I guess Yumi's prone to do so.

343
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,439
Master Haneda.

344
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,639
What?

345
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,939
You seem to be preoccupied about something.

346
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,039
Would you like to take an early lunch break?

347
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,739
I don't mind, you know.

348
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,140
No, we'll continue as is.

349
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,139
Right.

350
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,539
After getting hold of the 7th Crown title and I'm fully prepared,

351
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
I'll wait for Yumi's answer.

352
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,240
That's what I decided to do.

353
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,940
I'll carry out what I set out to do!

354
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,739
All of them... sort of look like numbers

355
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,339
but it's quite unclear.

356
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,439
I don't even know which numbers to type in first either.

357
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,940
Maybe this isn't the way to decipher the code?

358
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,439
Maybe the code isn't complete just with that one piece of paper.

359
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,939
What do you mean?

360
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,139
Maybe there's another similar type of paper with codes on it,

361
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,339
and if we put one paper on top of the other

362
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,039
and raise it up to the light and look through it,

363
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,839
the 8-digit number or a sentence indicating it will appear.

364
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,439
Then, we just look for another piece of paper with codes on it?

365
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,739
Yep, probably.

366
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,439
Okay! Everybody!

367
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,239
Let's look for the other piece!

368
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,739
Aye...

369
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,540
They're like lord and vassals already.

370
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,739
But searching for something like this brings back memories.

371
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,339
What? Memories of what?

372
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,939
Searching for bamboo shoots!

373
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,640
Bamboo shoots?

374
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,439
When I went over to Chukichi's condo,

375
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,739
he couldn't find the important fan that he wanted to show me

376
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,140
and he was flustered, so I found it for him.

377
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,939
What connection does that have to do with searching for bamboo shoots?

378
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,039
Because fans are made of bamboos, aren't they?

379
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,539
That fan was inside a pencil holder

380
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,239
and only a little of the top was showing.

381
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,139
So I told Chukichi!

382
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,539
"You can't find it because you try to look for the fan itself!

383
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,039
If you think that it's almost totally hidden,

384
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,740
it'll be easier to find."

385
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,639
Even for bamboo shoots, you only see the tip of it

386
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,739
and most the rest of it is hidden in the soil!

387
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,139
Really?

388
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,739
"Thoughts are like bamboo shoots

389
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,839
and most of them are buried in soil."

390
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,839
It explains that one should never judge a book by its cover.

391
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,039
It's a famous quote by Sankichi Sakata, an extraordinary shogi player!

392
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,839
Don't tell me she knew about it?

393
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,739
Well, I'm the one who put the fan

394
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,739
that was on the desk in the pencil holder

395
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,839
while Chukichi was using the restroom.

396
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,539
Just a coincidence.

397
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,039
But Master Taiko's name is Shukichi Haneda,

398
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,339
yet why do you call him "Chukichi"?

399
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,139
He's a finicky eater.

400
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,639
When we first started going with each other,

401
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,039
all he would eat was cheese, because he could pick it up

402
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,939
with his fingers without getting them dirty

403
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,139
And cheese is a favorite of mice?

404
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,039
Right! I couldn't stand watching that

405
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,739
so I made him eat super delicious short cake!

406
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,139
Then, Chukichi really got hooked on it!

407
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,939
Come to think of it,

408
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,139
the players usually eat sweet desserts during their matches.

409
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,639
Something about it peps up their brains.

410
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,639
If I remember correctly, Master Taiko started getting hold of the titles

411
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,239
ever since he started munching away on short cake during the matches.

412
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,939
Maybe this is just another coincidence, but...

413
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,339
She...

414
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,639
I wonder if it's really true?

415
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,739
Is there really another paper with codes on it?

416
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,839
Show me your resolution then!

417
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,939
Resolution?

418
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,039
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

419
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
How resolute you are about that!

420
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,039
Even if Yumi wants to be resolute,

421
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,939
there's nothing she can do, with an incomplete code!

422
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,739
In other words, the second piece of paper

423
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,339
should be as easy to find as the first.

424
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,939
Then, why can't we find it?

425
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,340
Gosh. What is going on?

426
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,340
"Next Episode"

427
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,139
What disappears when you make a copy?

428
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,739
I get it!

429
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,739
Men don't like to go back on their word.

430
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,339
Don't you dare lose to anybody till then!

431
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,939
You balding mouse!

432
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,240
She... I thought she was Chacha, but maybe...

433
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,540
Next Conan, "Marriage Registration Password (Part 2)"
