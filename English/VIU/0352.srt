1
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:04,407
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:06,407
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:07,907
They go off in great spirit for a big catch.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,607
And get caught in an unexpected crime.

5
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,107
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,107
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:15,308
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:09,754
Wow! It's fantastic!

9
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,224
What a beautiful lake!

10
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:17,625
Okutani Lake is called the sanctuary of bass fishing.

11
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,824
If things go well, they say you may even be able

12
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:23,524
to fish one as heavy as 5kg.

13
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,525
5kg?

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,824
Okay!

15
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:31,625
I'll eat to my heart's content and we'll win the match!

16
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:37,424
Genta, I think you've got it wrong.

17
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,324
No, I don't!

18
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,324
You're talking about the big-eaters contest, right?

19
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,025
Oh my.

20
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,325
Hey.

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,124
Ran and I are invited to attend a bass fishing contest

22
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,224
that is sponsored by Sonoko's father's company.

23
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,424
Genta and the others who hear of this

24
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,124
insisted that they wanted to participate in the contest too.

25
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,725
So, here we all are.

26
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:10,524
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 1)"

27
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,225
"Okutani Lake."

28
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,125
Oh, there you are.

29
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,824
Ran!

30
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,124
Sonoko!

31
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,425
Good morning!

32
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:23,824
Good morning!

33
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:28,824
Good morning! Thank you for inviting us here today!

34
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,224
What's this, what's this?

35
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:33,224
You guys know how to say your greetings!

36
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:36,024
Okay! Give it all you got today, you group of little shrimpies!

37
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:38,924
Well, I'm so sorry that we're shrimpies!

38
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:42,124
The brat with the glasses is here with you today too!

39
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,825
Well, sorry.

40
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,524
Mr. Mizui!

41
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,124
Sonoko.

42
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,125
What can I do for you?

43
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,824
These children are going to be entering the contest too,

44
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:57,625
so could you please register them right away?

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,724
Yes, all right.

46
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:06,325
Please write your names and addresses here.

47
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,024
This is Mr. Mizui from the head office.

48
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,924
She's my best riend, Ran.

49
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,024
Nice meeting you.

50
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,224
Oh! How do you do? I'm Junichi Mizui.

51
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,825
Nice meeting you!

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,624
Let's see...

53
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,224
I'm using this!

54
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,424
I'll take this, then.

55
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,524
What about you, Conan?

56
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,024
This one!

57
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:32,524
That? It looks like a hornworm and is gross.

58
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:35,024
But, Ayumi, it says here that

59
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:40,124
these soft baits are better for this.

60
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,624
Wow, this is interesting!

61
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,224
See, it looks just like a frog!

62
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,724
I didn't know there was bait like this!

63
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:50,525
Really. It sure looks like a real frog.

64
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,424
Oh, are you guys going to be entering the contest too?

65
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,224
Yup, we're going to win for sure.

66
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:00,524
"Saori Ayukawa (27), Contestant" -Oh, you two sure look strong.

67
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:03,524
Are you going to enter the contest too?

68
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:06,624
Of course! I registered long before at the reception desk already.

69
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,425
Don't be too hard on me, okay?

70
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,924
The champion and little fishermen.

71
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,525
"Toshihiko Funaki, Freelance Writer" -Thanks for the great picture.

72
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,324
See you guys, good luck.

73
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,025
Yes, we'll need it.

74
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,224
I shook her hand.

75
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,024
Maybe I shouldn't take a bath tonight.

76
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:40,324
Okay, shrimpies!

77
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,924
The contest will start soon.

78
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,124
What did you talk about with that woman?

79
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,424
She told us not to be too hard on her.

80
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:51,124
After that, she grabbed my hand firmly.

81
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,524
Ms. Ayukawa talked to you children?

82
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,524
Yeah, firmly, like so...

83
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,024
She sure is beautiful.

84
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,324
Do you know that woman?

85
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:06,124
She's the winner of last year's fishing contest.

86
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,424
She's that famous.

87
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,824
Yeah, that person who just came

88
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,824
is the next candidate for winner of this contest

89
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,924
called Takuya Masubuchi.

90
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,625
He won the contest the year before last.

91
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,324
The time now is 11:00.

92
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:26,424
We will be be starting the first day

93
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,924
of the Suzuki Cup Okutani Lake Tournament.

94
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:32,424
Please bring the five bass that you have fished

95
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,925
to the contest headquarters by 16:00 today.

96
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,224
Okay, let's give it a try!

97
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,925
We'll give it our best shot!

98
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,225
I wonder how this is going to work out.

99
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,624
Maybe a boat would've been better after all.

100
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:58,425
Bass are usually hiding where there are algae and fallen trees.

101
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,624
Okay, let's fish here!

102
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,524
Are you sure you know what you're doing, Conan?

103
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,924
Oh, it seems she's going to fish here too.

104
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:12,224
See. Even the candidate for winner thinks this place is the point.

105
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:14,324
Come on, let's get to it.

106
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,925
Okay, just leave it to me!

107
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,624
No good.

108
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,325
No luck here.

109
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:28,824
Maybe using a boat would've been better, after all?

110
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,724
How're you doing, little ones? Any luck?

111
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:34,324
-Not at all. -None.

112
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:38,124
I'm from Gekkan Bass, I write articles for this magazine.

113
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,624
My name's Funaki.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,224
And, mind you, it's Bass, not bus.

115
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,524
Give me a break.

116
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,824
We know.

117
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,924
I'm interviewing because I'm going to be writing an article

118
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,124
on this contest next month's edition.

119
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,724
Right! Let me take you pictures and put it in the magazine!

120
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,425
Line up, all of you.

121
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:59,424
Okay, here goes. One plus one is...

122
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,225
You and me!

123
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,824
Ms. Ayukawa seems to be doing good.

124
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,924
I guess I'll go get a picture of her.

125
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,024
Hey, if it's not the place that's bad, it must be the lure.

126
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,125
I guess so.

127
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,924
Don't do this.

128
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,624
We're just going to take a look at what kind of lure she's using.

129
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,124
You stay here, Ayumi.

130
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,025
My goodness.

131
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,924
She got all kinds.

132
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,524
This is it! If we could only have this.

133
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,824
I wonder if we can fish with this.

134
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,124
Of course.

135
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,225
No, you can't fish with that!

136
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:50,125
We're sorry!

137
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:53,924
Try fishing with this.

138
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,524
This lure...

139
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,424
has a certain smell.

140
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,225
I'm sure you'll be able to fish something.

141
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,925
Thank you so much!

142
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,824
It's being pulled.

143
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,625
It's being pulled! Talk about strong!

144
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,624
Mitsuhiko, keep cool.

145
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,424
Cool head! Calm down and wind the reel.

146
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,124
-The other way! -Okay.

147
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,024
Right, that's the way, keep it up!

148
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,824
It's big, heavy, my hands are going numb.

149
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,924
A little more. Wind it slowly.

150
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:37,025
It's black, a bass! Now! There!

151
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,825
-This is... -This is it?

152
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,725
Oh, my!

153
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,724
Are you all right?

154
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,025
Show it to me.

155
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,825
No big deal.

156
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,525
Let me clean your wound for you.

157
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,024
Does it hurt?

158
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,324
I've got bandage so hold on, okay?

159
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:09,124
But, before that let's sterilize the wound first.

160
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,325
Okay.

161
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,824
Conan, you're late. I was worried about you.

162
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,725
Hurry and get your fish weighed.

163
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,324
What's the matter?

164
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,725
Aren't you feeling well?

165
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:40,125
Don't tell me, you don't have any fish to weigh.

166
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,224
You couldn't fish even one?

167
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:49,825
All four of you? 4 times 0, 0 fish?

168
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,124
Sonoko, don't laugh!

169
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,825
But...

170
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:01,224
We'd like to announce the results for the first day.

171
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:05,124
In first place is Ms. Saori Ayukawa who fished a total of

172
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,725
13524 grams!

173
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,425
All right!

174
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,624
Wow!

175
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,324
We moved places, changed lures.

176
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,524
All that's left is...

177
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,924
All that's left is luck! Yup.

178
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,624
Let's turn luck in our direction tomorrow

179
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,524
and aim for a counter win!

180
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,625
Okay!

181
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,625
I wonder if it'll go that well.

182
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,729
Just what are you talking about?

183
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,329
Cut out the stupid talk.

184
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,528
It's nothing to get all worked up over, is it?

185
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,429
Excuse me.

186
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,528
It's really huge, don't you think?

187
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,728
My friend fished it.

188
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,828
The person who fished this is called Mr. Kanie?

189
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,528
Yeah, Mr. Kensuke Kanie.

190
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,229
He was a skilled fisher.

191
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:21,028
How can you fish a big fish like that?

192
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,328
Because we've been fishing since we were kids.

193
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,528
If you start from now, Ayumi,

194
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:26,928
I'm sure that by the time you become an adult,

195
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,028
you'll be a great fisherman.

196
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,328
Really?

197
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,228
Maybe I should start right now.

198
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:36,928
Saori, why did you decide to start fishing?

199
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,128
My father used to fish,

200
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,728
so he used to take me along with him to rivers and lakes

201
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,128
since I was really little.

202
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,228
That's why I never went to amusement parks or zoos

203
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,028
until I entered high school.

204
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,628
What? Poor thing.

205
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:55,829
Oh, there you are, Ms. Ayukawa.

206
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,628
Wanna drink with me, in advance celebration of your victory?

207
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,428
No, thank you, I'd rather not.

208
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:07,228
Oh, are you saying that you don't want to drink with me?

209
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,628
Are you sure about that?

210
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,629
Are you sure that's what you really want to say?

211
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,928
I'm just kidding, only joke.

212
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,328
The thing is, I want you to tell me something.

213
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,528
I thought that while I'm here anyway,

214
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,728
I'd go and finish my work on Rail Mania too.

215
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:31,828
You know almost everything about this place, don't you?

216
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,928
Not really.

217
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,828
Please tell me and help me.

218
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,329
Please, Saori.

219
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,029
Okay.

220
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,828
Oh, that'll be a great help.

221
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,829
I'm indebted to you. Thanks so much.

222
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:57,528
He said, Rail Mania. I bought that magazine before.

223
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,528
He's a freelance writer,

224
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,928
so he's writing for many different types of magazines.

225
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,629
I see.

226
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,028
Conan, let's fish by boat today.

227
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,928
During this season, I'm sure the bass

228
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,628
are hiding behind things near the shore and waiting for bait.

229
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,028
No matter what your reasoning is,

230
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,328
we were fishing all day near the shore yesterday, and caught nothing!

231
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,728
So, today...

232
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:30,828
-We're getting on the boat today in order to win. -Right!

233
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,528
I'm going to fish on land after all.

234
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,728
I'm thinking of going some place else today.

235
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:40,028
Okay, see you then.

236
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,328
What about you, Ayumi?

237
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:43,928
What should I do?

238
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:45,528
Oh, Ms. Ayukawa!

239
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:46,828
Good morning!

240
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:51,028
Ms. Ayukawa, where are you going to fish today?

241
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,828
I'm planning to Kutanisuji today.

242
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:56,229
May I go along with you?

243
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,228
It's dangerous there, so I'd rather you don't.

244
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,628
Oh.

245
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,328
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

246
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,728
Good luck, all of you.

247
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,528
Kutanisuji.

248
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,328
Mitsuhiko, let's go there.

249
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,828
Let's take the boat and and beat her to the at Kutanisuji!

250
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,228
Good luck, all of you!

251
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,828
Let's go, Ayumi.

252
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,029
Okay.

253
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,828
Ms. Ayukawa!

254
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,328
Huh? Where?

255
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,828
Oh, true.

256
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,529
Ms. Ayukawa!

257
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,629
I should've gotten on the boat too.

258
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,828
A trolley!

259
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,729
Hello!

260
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,828
What? We hit something.

261
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,429
There was definitely a sound.

262
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,328
What could it be?

263
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,828
Could it be something used when fishing?

264
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,629
I've never seen something like this.

265
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,828
He's Mr. Masubuchi a candidate for champion, right?

266
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,128
Which means, this must be a good place to fish.

267
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,428
But even if the place is good...

268
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,428
Oh, but it's the second day,

269
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,128
I'm sure Conan and the others have fished a lot today.

270
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,829
I wonder.

271
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,728
It's just a little further upstream, right?

272
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,128
What's wrong?

273
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,729
Look, what's that?

274
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,228
I wonder what he's doing.

275
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:48,528
Maybe he sulked out because he can't catch fish and sleeping.

276
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,429
I doubt it.

277
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,428
What's the matter, Ran?

278
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,028
Conan.

279
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,328
A person is lying on the ground!

280
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,228
Ayumi, wait here, okay?

281
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:17,229
Oh, okay.

282
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,229
Mr. Funaki.

283
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,829
Kerosene?

284
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:31,828
If he slipped and hit his head,

285
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,428
there should be blood on the rock.

286
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,028
Search for it!

287
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,928
What is the estimated time of death?

288
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:42,128
He's still warm.

289
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,929
I'd say it's between 15 to 30 minutes.

290
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:51,028
He's so scary.

291
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,328
Oh, the ones who found him?

292
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,228
You guys are...

293
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:59,328
If I remember correctly, you're Smoky Kogoro's...

294
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,528
You mean Sleeping Kogoro.

295
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:06,928
Officer Yokomizo, thank you so much always.

296
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,228
-And, you are? -I'm a junior at Teitan High school,

297
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,828
Sonoko Suzuki.

298
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,228
I'm the presenter of this fishing contest

299
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:15,028
and here on behalf of the chairman.

300
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:17,228
Oh, you're the one who thrives on attention,

301
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,829
the daughter of the host of this contest.

302
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:25,528
Will you explain the conditions when you found him?

303
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,028
Sonoko and I were at the contest headquarters,

304
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,528
but we came walking along to check on Conan and the others,

305
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:34,428
then, we found Mr. Funaki over there.

306
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,528
So, the victim's name is Funaki?

307
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,528
Yup. He said he was a freelance writer for magazines,

308
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,128
and was saying that he was going to write an article

309
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:43,528
of this fishing contest for a magazine called Gekkan Bass.

310
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,128
Where were you kids?

311
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:51,428
I was upstream about 30m from here together with Ayumi and fishing.

312
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:56,128
When you were there, didn't you hear his scream or something?

313
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,528
Nope.

314
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:58,628
We didn't, did we?

315
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,829
We didn't hear a thing.

316
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,628
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

317
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:05,828
Did you find it?

318
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,428
Well, we searched all over

319
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:12,628
but didn't come up with anything the victim could've hit his head on.

320
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,629
What? You couldn't find anything?

321
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:26,828
I was near Otakeiwa between 10:00 to 10:30.

322
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,228
Do you have anyone who can prove that for you?

323
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:32,228
I was right near him all the time.

324
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:35,628
Both of us were fishing together from early morning at Otakeiwa.

325
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,728
Where is this Otakeiwa?

326
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:40,628
Around here.

327
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,428
You may both leave.

328
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,029
Thank you.

329
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,529
Talk about gruff.

330
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,728
Only 30 minutes had past since Mr. Funaki had died.

331
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,628
It takes 20 minutes from the contest headquarters

332
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:00,528
to where the corpse was found.

333
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:03,828
Without using a boat, the only way to cross the lake

334
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,428
would be to use the path above the dam.

335
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,528
It would take more than 5 minutes to cross the dam,

336
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:12,728
so it would've been impossible for anybody

337
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,029
who was on the right side of the lake to commit the crime.

338
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,528
You're Ms. Saori Ayukawa?

339
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:21,028
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:25,128
Oh, are you saying you don't want to drink with me?

341
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:29,028
Are you sure that's what you want?

342
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,928
Will you please tell me where and what you were doing

343
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,428
between 10:00 and 10:30?

344
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:34,628
Yes.

345
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,928
I was going up the opposite way to Kutanisuji

346
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,429
from the crossroad of the main trail.

347
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,428
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

348
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,828
We saw her!

349
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,228
We were on the boat,

350
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:51,928
but we definitely saw Ms. Ayukawa go into Kutanisuji.

351
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,228
Yes, we waved goodbye to her.

352
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:57,028
-No doubt about it. -Yes.

353
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:00,229
Okay, you may go back to the contest.

354
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,229
Thank you.

355
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,728
What about us?

356
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,528
You guys can go too!

357
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,028
You don't need proof of our alibi?

358
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,728
No, I don't! I don't have time for kids.

359
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:16,528
What a surprise.

360
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,528
He's the one who took our picture for us, right?

361
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,428
I wonder if that place is cursed.

362
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,928
Cursed?

363
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,328
Mr. Mizui, just what do you mean by that?

364
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,628
The thing is, half a year ago, somebody died there too.

365
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:34,728
Since there was no one around back then,

366
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,728
the case closed as an accident.

367
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,528
Who died?

368
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,328
A person called Mr. Kanie,

369
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:44,728
who was very intimate with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

370
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:46,129
Kanie?

371
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:51,129
Kensuke Kanie, he was a skilled fisher.

372
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:57,128
Then, he was a candidate for champion too?

373
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:02,328
Yes. Just like Mr. Masubuchi, he was Ms. Ayukawas's father's student too.

374
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,828
Ms. Ayukawa's father?

375
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,828
He already passed away

376
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,528
but Ms. Ayukawa's father

377
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,828
is the person who spread sports fishing in Japan.

378
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:15,429
He established a fishing club and taught bass fishing.

379
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,628
Somebody died there 6 months ago.

380
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,728
This is no coincidence.

381
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:25,829
The murderer is most probably one of the two!

382
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,528
Conan, what are we going to do in a place like this?

383
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:02,128
Let's go home.

384
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:03,829
A trolley?

385
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,028
I see!

386
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,128
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

387
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:10,529
Never mind, let's go!

388
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,328
Isn't that Mr. Funaki's?

389
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,628
The actual murder place is here!

390
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,029
But, how?

391
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,728
Next Conan,

392
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:27,029
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 2)"

393
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,028
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,128
"Newest model fishing pole."

395
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:49,128
The fish played peek-a-boo right now.

396
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,828
What a fish ball.

397
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:51,829
What a fish!
