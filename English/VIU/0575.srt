1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,350
I'm sorry, Yuika.

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,150
"Mihiro Kuze (26)" -About Mr. Monwaki...

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,650
If I were more reliable,

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,550
you guys didn't have to end up that way.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,850
It's okay, Mihiro.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,150
Who cares about a guy who has to fool around with a friend of mine?

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,350
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -Right now, I'm glad I split with a guy like him.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,350
Did you buy the clothes that you're going to be wearing tomorrow?

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,250
Yep, I did!

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,950
A cute Goth Lolita outfit!

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,150
I'm wearing it right now!

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,650
You can look forward to seeing it tomorrow!

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,050
Okay, I'll wait for you at the usual place then.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,550
Okay.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,050
Yuika.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,450
We're best friends, right?

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,650
What a stupid thing to say!

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,150
Until death, of course!

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,550
Yuika.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,450
See you tomorrow, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,950
Yes!

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,350
Until death... that is.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,250
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,650
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,250
What is the black conspiracy

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,450
that is hidden behind The Goth Lolita outfit?

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,250
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,250
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,350
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:25,988
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 1)"

31
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,046
Darn it.

32
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:35,746
What cruse of fate has brought the famed Kogoro Mouri

33
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:41,146
to shop along with two girls on my precious day off.

34
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,446
It won't hurt to do so once in a while!

35
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,446
Your eyes will enjoy

36
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,846
all the nice looking young girls walking through town!

37
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,946
Besides...

38
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,246
You have all the time in the world

39
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:54,346
because you had no incoming job anyway.

40
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:56,346
Idiot! I had to organize the dramas

41
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,546
I recorded on the DVD recorder.

42
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,546
I had to also go check on the way the balls

43
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:03,146
come out on the machine of a new panchinko shop that's opening too,

44
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:05,446
and also...

45
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,846
Today's the G1 horse race!

46
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:10,046
That's the kind of stuff that people refer to

47
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,846
as someone who has all the time in the world do!

48
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:14,146
What?

49
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:16,446
Dad, don't go wasting your money

50
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,846
on stuff like pachinko and horse racing!

51
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,446
Talk for yourself!

52
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,346
You're going to get it if you buy super expensive clothes!

53
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,746
Don't worry.

54
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,946
I'm only buying cheap cute clothes!

55
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:30,646
Right!

56
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:33,746
I don't care what

57
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,146
but show it to me before you buy it, now!

58
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,746
What?

59
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:40,746
Oh, no, I don't think so.

60
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,346
What's this?

61
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:45,346
Are you saying that you're going to buy lewd clothes

62
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,446
that you can't even show your parent?

63
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:50,346
Like teeny-weeny T-shirts that show your belly

64
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,846
or Chinese dresses that reveal most of your thighs?

65
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,146
That's more your taste.

66
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,946
You don't have to look at them

67
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,146
because none of them are going to be sexy.

68
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:02,146
Well, I think you'll be surprised either way

69
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:03,946
if you see them anyway.

70
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,046
Hello!

71
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:23,546
What's that look about, that witch looking outfit...

72
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,146
-Super cute! -Super cute!

73
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:26,146
What?

74
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:28,246
It's Goth Lolita, Goth Lolita!

75
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,146
It's nice after all!

76
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,246
Goth... Lolita?

77
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:36,146
Gothic Lolita is a fashion in which black clothes

78
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:38,546
that are worn by vampires and draculas that appear in Gothic novels

79
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,546
or monster movies based on such things are worn.

80
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:48,446
They also said on TV that these outfits are very womanly!

81
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:53,946
Just what kind of programs is he usually watching anyway?

82
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,846
Well... it's the kind of fashion I think Ai would look good in.

83
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,446
I hope you two aren't planning

84
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,946
to buy that monster-like outfit too, are you?

85
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,146
We're buying something that's cuter!

86
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,746
Something like what a doll would wear.

87
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,446
You mean, Lolita fashions then.

88
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,846
I don't know about this Goth Lolita or Ghost Lotta thing,

89
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,446
but I'm not ever letting you

90
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:20,146
wear a Halloween outfit like fashion like that!

91
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,646
Thank you for waiting.

92
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:43,746
Uh... That customer that was here just now...

93
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:47,746
I hope she didn't leave because I criticized her outfit.

94
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:50,446
Oh, no. She said that

95
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:53,146
the friend that she's waiting for hasn't come yet.

96
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,046
So, she seems to have gone the restroom.

97
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,246
The restroom is outside the shop, you see.

98
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,546
I see.

99
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,446
The lady who was wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

100
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:10,246
hasn't come back yet.

101
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,146
If she's waiting for someone,

102
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:14,646
it'd be better if she's in her seat and yet...

103
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:17,746
Women take their time in the restroom, so...

104
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,246
Hello! For one?

105
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:26,846
Oh, no. Didn't a girl in Goth Lolita outfit come?

106
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,946
She's my friend.

107
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,446
She's here.

108
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,946
She's sing the restroom now, though.

109
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,146
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

110
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,046
What did Mihiro order?

111
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,346
Well, nothing yet,

112
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:43,046
although she was looking through the menu.

113
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,346
She said she'd order after her friend arrives.

114
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:50,046
Okay then, I'll wait till Mihiro comes and then, place my order.

115
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,146
Hey...

116
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:56,046
I'm sorry!

117
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:59,346
No problem. I'll clean it up.

118
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,646
Really, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,946
No problem.

120
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:08,046
Well, I drank what I wanted to,

121
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,446
so let's start off into town!

122
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:12,846
We checked out the shops through and through already too!

123
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,846
Okay, we're going, kid!

124
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,246
Hey!

125
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:22,946
Yep.

126
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:32,246
Hey...

127
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:36,546
What's with everybody, wearing crazy clothes?

128
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,646
Just as would be expected of Harajuku.

129
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:41,546
Don't tell me that you guys are like these people.

130
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,346
I mean, they're gone!

131
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:47,646
Ran and Sonoko said that they're going shopping,

132
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:50,346
so for us to browse around this area!

133
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,946
Darn! Just what do they think they're doing?

134
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,246
There's no reason for me to come along then!

135
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:59,246
Rather, there is... You're probably here because...

136
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:04,446
Just as I thought.

137
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:06,546
They want you to carry their shopping bags.

138
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,346
Next, this store!

139
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,546
This is cute, isn't it?

140
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:13,546
What's cute about it anyway?

141
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,746
Hey, don't peek inside!

142
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:18,946
Then, hold your own stuff!

143
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:29,046
Hey, oh no!

144
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,146
Isn't this ice cream?

145
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,646
What language?

146
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,846
I'm not sure because it's too fast.

147
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:47,146
They're ice cream thieves!

148
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,346
Thieves?

149
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,046
No!

150
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:54,146
It's used a lot abroad to steal things from Japanese people!

151
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:56,746
When trying to wipe the ice cream off,

152
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:58,346
in order to free your hands,

153
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,946
you'll put the things that you're holding down, right?

154
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,646
And while one is talking away in a foreign language,

155
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,346
in order to distract the victim,

156
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,246
his accomplice takes off

157
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,946
after stealing the belongings of that tourist.

158
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,246
Hey! Hold it!

159
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:17,446
I mean, I saw it on TV.

160
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:22,946
I wonder what kind of programs Conan is always watching!

161
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,146
But, talk about bummers...

162
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,046
We can't shop with our clothes like this.

163
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:32,046
Then, why don't you change into the clothes you bought?

164
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:36,146
I mean, you bought it already, so why not?

165
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:43,946
Listen? Both of you! Don't you dare laugh, okay?

166
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,946
Well, I know we'll be taken aback, though.

167
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,946
There are so many customers before us.

168
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,446
They seem to be here for the same purpose.

169
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:01,246
Hey, you!

170
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:04,346
Come out, already! Darn!

171
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,846
What seems to be the matter?

172
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:11,046
The person's been in here for over 30 minutes already!

173
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:15,646
Maybe she's passed out from a heart stroke or something.

174
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,746
-What? -In that case...

175
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,946
Sonoko!

176
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,246
I'll take a look from above.

177
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,946
Hey, what's up?

178
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:34,546
In... In the toilet... compartment...

179
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,146
The Goth... Goth Lolita...

180
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,646
Huh?

181
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,246
Just what're you talking about?

182
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,046
There are strangulation marks on the neck

183
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,946
as well as "Yoshikawa Lines" showing that

184
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,446
the victim scratched her neck in resistance.

185
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:58,346
Murder by strangulation...

186
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,703
Gee, but what an outfit...

187
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,003
The clothes that this victim is wearing.

188
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:15,103
You mean this is the trend nowadays?

189
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:17,403
No, it's called Goth Lolita fashion

190
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,303
and has been around for some time already.

191
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,903
I'm sorry I don't know anything about these trendy things.

192
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,003
Oh, don't be.

193
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:30,503
And? What about the identity of the victim?

194
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,603
From the driver's license that she had on her,

195
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:38,103
she's a resident of Haido cho named Ms. Mihiro Kuze.

196
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:44,603
There are strangulation marks and Yoshikawa lines on her neck.

197
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:47,503
No doubt this is murder by strangulation.

198
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:49,503
Yoshikawa line?

199
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,503
What's that?

200
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:54,003
It's police jargon.

201
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,103
When a person is strangled,

202
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:58,803
they try to remove the string or rope that's around their neck

203
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,703
with their hand because they can't breathe, right?

204
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,303
Most times

205
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:06,203
the nail marks of the person who is being strangled are left behind!

206
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,003
This happens because the pain of being choked

207
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,703
is much less tolerable than the pain of scratching!

208
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:15,303
And the first person who took note of the fact

209
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:18,003
that the scratch marks are evidence of someone

210
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:20,203
who had been murdered by strangulation was

211
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:23,403
a man called Mr. Youichi Yoshikawa who used to work as a forensic officer

212
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,203
at the police department in the Taisho Era.

213
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:31,603
Since then, the scratch marks are referred to as Yoshikawa marks!

214
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,903
And you're going to say that you watched it on TV again?

215
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:37,203
Yep.

216
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,703
On what kind of program?

217
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,503
The evening news.

218
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:48,703
And? Is it true that you people saw this woman today?

219
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,903
Yes.

220
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:53,303
I accompanied by daughter and her friend shopping today.

221
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:57,703
They stopped by at a bookstore in Shinjuku before shopping,

222
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,003
and checked inside the fashion magazine

223
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,603
that they bought at a coffee shop that we stepped into.

224
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,603
That's when this victim walked in!

225
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,803
You mean a coffee shop in Shinjuku?

226
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,303
Yes, sir.

227
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:18,603
And when my daughter and her friend went into the restroom

228
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,503
to change into the clothes that they bought in Shinjuku,

229
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:23,703
they happened to run into her again!

230
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:26,703
To this ruthlessly murder woman here...

231
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:29,603
When the victim came to the coffee shop,

232
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,903
wasn't she with someone?

233
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:35,403
It seems she was waiting for a friend to come there.

234
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:39,003
A woman wearing glasses who looked like she was an office worker.

235
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,303
What time did the two come to the coffee shop?

236
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:43,703
The woman dressed in Goth Lolita outfit

237
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,503
came a little before 13:00.

238
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,503
And the office lady looking person

239
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:51,103
came 10 or 15 minutes afterwards.

240
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:55,503
The estimated time of death was the one hour

241
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:57,903
between 12:30 in the afternoon to 13:30?

242
00:14:57,903 --> 00:14:58,903
Yes, sir.

243
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,503
Which means that there's a possibility that

244
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,903
the office lady, after meeting the victim at the shop,

245
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,703
brought her to the restroom here, in this park in Harajuku

246
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:09,003
and killed her.

247
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:12,003
But, how did she lock the door

248
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,003
leaving the dead body on the toilet seat?

249
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,803
After closing the door,

250
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:18,603
she got on top of this bucket that was in the tool closet

251
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:20,803
and used the handle of the brush inserting it from above the door

252
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,803
and locked the door.

253
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:26,103
After all, the lock for this door is a simple slide type.

254
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,503
Is this restroom always so crowded?

255
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,903
No, it gets crowded just around this time

256
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,603
and it seems that by the time the girls got here,

257
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,003
the toilet door was already locked,

258
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,603
and the cell phone seems to have been ringing occasionally.

259
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:45,303
-Cell phone? -Yes, sir.

260
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:49,003
After checking the received calls history of the victim's cell phone,

261
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,303
within the 2 hours that have gone by,

262
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:54,203
it seems that someone has been calling this victim every 10 minutes.

263
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,303
Another call...

264
00:15:57,303 --> 00:16:00,003
It's the same number as the one in the received calls history!

265
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:03,403
Hey, Miharu!

266
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:04,803
Just what do you think you're doing?

267
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,103
I've been waiting for you all this time at the coffee shop.

268
00:16:07,103 --> 00:16:08,703
Miharu?

269
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,003
Well, I'm from the police.

270
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,303
Police?

271
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,603
Is something wrong with Mihiro?

272
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,203
The thing is...

273
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:23,903
No...

274
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,303
Mihiro, why?

275
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,303
There's no mistake that

276
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:33,203
you were going to see Ms. Mihiro Kuze here today?

277
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:34,903
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:38,003
At a coffee shop in Shinjuku at 13:00.

279
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:41,803
And you came to this park restroom in Harajuku

280
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,903
after meeting her at the coffee shop?

281
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,603
I haven't seen Mihiro at all today yet!

282
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:52,103
Huh? But you both went to that shop?

283
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,103
One came in after the other went out!

284
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:56,303
About 10 minutes after the person wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

285
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:59,003
went to use the restroom, she came.

286
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:03,403
Then, Mihiro never came back from the restroom?

287
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:06,003
No, sir! I had the person working here

288
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,103
go check for her in the restroom,

289
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:11,503
but there seems to have been no one there.

290
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:15,303
That's why I kept calling Mihiro's cell phone every 10 minutes.

291
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,903
But just couldn't seem to get through.

292
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,303
And when I finally did get through...

293
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:23,403
I answered the phone.

294
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:24,903
Yes!

295
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:29,003
But, why didn't you go check the restroom yourself?

296
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:32,603
Because the restroom was outside the shop.

297
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:37,103
I thought that it's not good to leave the shop

298
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,803
before paying for something I ordered.

299
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:40,703
Which means that you were in that coffee shop all the while,

300
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:42,303
from the time you arrived there?

301
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:46,503
Yes. I think the employee here can testify to that.

302
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:50,903
I think it's only right to go take a look at the coffee shop then?

303
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,503
I guess so, while your memories still fresh.

304
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:57,903
Well, then, we'll head on for the shop,

305
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,903
so Officer Takagi, you wait here!

306
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,803
If you come up with something, contact me!

307
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:04,303
Yes, sir!

308
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:06,503
What's the matter, Sonoko?

309
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:13,303
Something just doesn't seem to feel right about her, don't you think?

310
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:14,503
What about?

311
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:17,303
Usually, when you wear Goth Lolita clothes,

312
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:21,103
don't you manicure your nails black or white?

313
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:25,103
She has nothing on her nails.

314
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,103
Come to think of it, I don't think she had anything on

315
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,403
from the time she came to the coffee shop.

316
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:34,403
Didn't you find any fake nails on the floor of the toilet?

317
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:37,803
No, nothing was found on the floor.

318
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:41,803
Hey, what're you doing? Let's go!

319
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,303
You guys are witnesses too, you know!

320
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,803
Yep.

321
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,603
Yes, she came!

322
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,003
A little before 13:00...

323
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:55,403
to this seat.

324
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:59,203
Are you sure there's no mistake that it was her?

325
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,403
Yes, I'm sure.

326
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,303
She had a very small voice, though.

327
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,903
Small voice?

328
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,203
She asked me what time it was

329
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,903
as soon as she got to her seat.

330
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:13,103
I told her it was 12:56.

331
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:16,803
Although the clock was right next to her seat.

332
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:20,603
Is it true that she came to this shop

333
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:24,403
about 10 minutes after this woman left for the restroom?

334
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:25,503
Yes.

335
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:26,803
She said she was waiting for her friend

336
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:29,503
who would be wearing Goth Lolita clothes.

337
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,803
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

338
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:37,903
I think it was around 13:12.

339
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:42,803
Was she at this seat all the while after that?

340
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,703
Yes. It seemed she tried calling the woman

341
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:49,203
who went to the restroom repeatedly though.

342
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:53,303
If she's the culprit,

343
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:55,303
she would've had to call the victim out to the park

344
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:56,803
right after she went to the restroom,

345
00:19:56,803 --> 00:20:00,803
and come back after killing her.

346
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:03,403
But from the shop to the restroom of the park,

347
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,503
even if she were to use the train or a car,

348
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,403
it would take at least 30 minutes to make a round trip.

349
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:14,503
She couldn't have committed the crime.

350
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:18,003
I'm sure she was cursed by a bad witch!

351
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:19,903
What?

352
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:22,703
Witch, Conan?

353
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:25,303
Because the lady in Goth Lolita clothes

354
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:28,603
looked normal in the picture of her driver's license,

355
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,203
but when I saw her, she was wearing a dreadful look

356
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,403
as if she were cursed or something!

357
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,103
Idiot!

358
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,903
When wearing Goth Lolita clothes,

359
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,503
you make your skin look white by wearing pale coloured foundation

360
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,203
and use mascara to make your eyes stand out!

361
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:46,603
Right, right. Even if Sonoko or I were to do it,

362
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:48,803
our make-up would look like that.

363
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:51,103
If the same goes for the clothes,

364
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:54,003
it'll be hard to tell one person from the other!

365
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:02,803
Inspector, maybe this is...

366
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,403
Yeah.

367
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:08,303
I guess we'll have to check and see

368
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:11,003
if the person who came to the shop was really Mihiro.

369
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,503
A person dressed in Goth Lolita clothes

370
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:18,603
was found dead in the restroom of a park.

371
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:21,703
We were at this coffee shop in Shinjuku

372
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,803
and witnessed the victim before she was killed.

373
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,503
She sat down

374
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:31,903
and went to the restroom right away.

375
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,403
After about 10 minutes,

376
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,903
the friend that she was waiting for appeared.

377
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,703
After that, the woman in Goth Lolita clothes

378
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:42,703
never came back to the shop.

379
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,403
The victim is a person called

380
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,703
Ms. Mihiro Kuze, a resident of Haido-cho.

381
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:55,903
The one that was waiting for her was her friend, Ms. Yuika Shodo.

382
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,303
Ms. Shodo was waiting for Mihiro all the while,

383
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:01,603
but Mihiro never came back.

384
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:04,903
From the park in Harajuku

385
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,003
where the toilet that the body was found was,

386
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,203
to this coffee shop in Shinjuku

387
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,103
even if a car or train were used,

388
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:13,303
it would take at least 30 minutes round trip.

389
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:17,403
It would've been impossible for Ms. Shodo

390
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,203
who was at the shop all the while, to commit the crime.

391
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,403
However, is it really so?

392
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:29,803
I don't think we'll be able to close this case that easily!

393
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:56,303
"Next Episode"

394
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:01,203
So, you think it's strange after all?

395
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:04,803
It isn't strange, but...

396
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:08,703
But you were lucky that the glass cup cracked.

397
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:11,103
Lucky?

398
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:18,103
I won't let this case go to sleep, though.

399
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:26,503
