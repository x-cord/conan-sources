"Gifu Station"

2
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:05,654
We are here!

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:06,855
We made it.

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,455
"Nobunaga Oda"

5
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:18,971
It is so shiny.

6
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,871
It'a Lord Nogunaga!

7
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:22,771
Amazing!

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,471
This year 2017,

9
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:28,371
marks the 450th year since Military Commander Nobunaga Oda

10
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:32,171
of the Sengoku Period made his triumphant entry into the Gifu Castle.

11
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:34,771
So while city touring,

12
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:37,171
we decided to take a look at the various commemorative events

13
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,571
that were being held.

14
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,072
"Gifu Media Cosmos"

15
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:05,271
It sure was interesting, wasn't it, Conan?

16
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,072
Yeah, it sure was.

17
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:11,871
I didn't know you liked things like this, Ayumi.

18
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,471
There are many girls who like things like these recently you know.

19
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:17,771
History loving or Sengoku Period loving girls, right?

20
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:20,771
I don't know about that...

21
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:23,371
But it was really interesting!

22
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:25,671
Okay, let's head on to the next place.

23
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:27,472
-Okay! -Okay!

24
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,372
"Nobunaga 450 Project"

25
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:33,571
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

26
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:36,071
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

27
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:37,771
A case casts a shadow over new heroes of Sengoku Gifu,

28
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:40,071
the Nobuna Gaizers.

29
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,771
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,771
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:46,372
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,630
"Nobunaga 450 (Yongomaru) Case"

33
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,029
"Juhachiro"

34
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,629
This is the inn we're staying at tonight.

35
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,129
-Welcome. -Welcome.

36
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,330
-Hello. -Hello.

37
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,030
Mr. Tobayama!

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,679
Mr. Agasa.

39
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,479
Everyone, he's an old friend of mine

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,779
as well as the one who invited us over,

41
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,879
cormorant fisherman, Mr. Tobayama.

42
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,079
"Iwao Tobayama (55), Cormorant fisherman" -Hello.

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,879
You're the Detective Squad, right?

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,980
-Nice to meet you! -Nice to meet you!

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
What an energetic bunch!

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,580
-Fantastic! -Pretty!

47
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
Mr. Tobayama.

48
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,780
-Mr. Tobayama! -Mr. Tobayama!

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,879
So, where shall we "ikomaika" next?

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,279
That's the Gifu dialect.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,179
Correctly "ikomaika" is not to be used in the interrogative form.

52
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,579
It means where shall we go, though.

53
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,879
You sure know it all as expected. Don't you, Mr. Detective?

54
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,979
So...

55
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,879
I'm starving, famished.

56
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,479
What? You ate 3 servings of Hida beef steak

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,579
just a while ago, Genta?

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,880
Right.

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,680
In that case, I have some place I want to go.

60
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,680
Nobunaga triumphantly entered the castle 400 and...

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,379
50 years ago!

62
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,879
The year 2017 is indeed a commemorative year.

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,280
May justice and friendship abide on this land!

64
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,380
We bring you courage and effort!

65
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,880
Love and smiles too!

66

-We are the Origami Squadron, -We are the Origami Squadron,

67
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,680
-the Nobuna Gaizers! -the Nobuna Gaizers!

68
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,179
A local hero show.

69
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,379
No... Nobu? Noza? What?

70
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,179
Since their called Nobuna Gaizer,

71
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,779
I guess the heroes have some sort of lineage with Nobunaga Oda.

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,079
Awesome!

73
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,679
You think so too, right?

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,679
Actually my purpose for coming...

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,180
"Local Hero Album" -was this.

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,279
Fantastic.

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,079
Did you handmake this yourself?

78
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,179
Yes.

79
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,779
I'm collecting data of local heroes nationwide

80
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,279
in each district when I go on trips

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,279
and on the internet too.

82
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,979
This sure is a huge collection.

83
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,679
With this many heroes around,

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,279
Earth is a super safe place.

85
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,580
Yeah, right?

-Nobuna Gaizer! -Nobuna Gaizer!

Nobuna Gaizer!

88

By the way, that was lethal Gaizer Triple Decker Knock Down.

89
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,680
-Super awesome! -Fantastic!

90
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,679
Let me help you.

91
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,079
Me too.

92
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,180
I'll help too.

93
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,479
Thanks!

94
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,279
We've got a gift to give you from Nobuna Gaizer too.

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,879
Please get it before you go, okay!

96

Stand in line, stand in line.

Here you go.

99
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,779
What a pretty paper!

100
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,479
This is Mino Japanese paper, right?

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,679
It's amazing that you know!

102
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,079
It's because I've checked on the places that you've performed activities

103
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,379
in before coming here, you see.

104
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,679
That's great.

105

Thank you.

I'm really delighted and moved!

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,379
That was wonderful.

113

to peek into the faces of the heroes.

on the way back will you.

Okay, okay.

But, Genta, I think you're eating too much.

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,579
And were the police notified?

169
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,279
Dr. Agasa used Pop's name and asked them to start investigation.

170
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

171
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,979
You're... You all look familiar.

172
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,579
Now I remember.

173
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,079
We saw you during the Onizawakyo Earth Heritabe Incident.

174
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,179
You're Detective Matsushiro, right?

175
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,779
"Tamekichi Matsushiro, Detective of the 1st Investigation Division" -But...

176
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,279
"of the Gifu Prefectural Police Department" -Mr. Mouri's not here today?

177
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,179
But, Dr. Agasa is here with us.

178
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,079
Dr. Agasa.

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,079
Of course, I know.

180
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,079
You're the one who have solved difficult cases

181
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,579
and is as good as Mr. Mouri if not better.

182
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,079
Is that so?

183
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,679
I've been doing all the work, though.

184
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,479
They'll hear you.

185
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,079
Then, I'd like to ask you for the details once again.

186
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,879
But, Mitsuhiko's whereabouts were not at all known yet.

187
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,579
Moreover...

188
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,779
The members of Nobuna Gaizer have also disappeared?

189
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,279
What's going on?

190
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,679
Just in case, we've got to interrogate them.

191
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
And yet we still can't get a hold of them.

192
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,179
I'm starting to get bad vibes.

193
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,379
You can say that again.

194
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,380
"Gifu City Museum of History"

195
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,379

"Miniature solid gold statue of Lord Nobunaga"

197
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,476
The stolen items are...

198
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:03,576
the miniature solid gold statue of Nobunaga

199
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:05,476
and the golden tile

200
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,476
as well as old documents that are of great historical value and such.

201
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:11,676
They are all precious treasure of Gifu.

202
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:13,276
We'd better hurry,

203
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:14,976
or they may be sold off to the black market.

204
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,676
And maybe even exported abroad?

205
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:18,276
Really?

206
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,677
This is really turning into something big.

207
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:32,576
Will you show us the footage on the security camera?

208
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:33,577
Sure!

They're...

211
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,177
Nobuna Gaizer, right?

212
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:51,676
No way.

213
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:53,476
It's hard to believe

214
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,376
but heroes committing a robbery?

215
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,577
This is absurd. It's unforgivable!

216
00:13:58,577 --> 00:13:59,977
What the...

217
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,677
You found the Nobun Gaizer car?

218
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:17,477
What's that?

219
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,376
It's the Nobunaga badge!

220
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,876
Could it be Mitsuhiko's?

221
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:26,276
You mean he was on this car?

222
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:27,976
Don't tell me he was taken hostage?

223
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:29,376
-What? -What?

224
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:32,177
-Look. -I noticed too.

225
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:36,377
Besides, look at the front tires.

226
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:42,276
That's...

227
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,876
No doubt about it.

228
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:46,176
It's asphalt tar.

229
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,376
"Nobuna Gaizer" -Nobuna Gaizer, the popular local heroes

230
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,876
"Nobuna Gaizer Wanted" -who are known for cleaning the city

231
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:53,576
and helping the elderly,

232
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:57,776
are wanted as suspects in a robbery case.

233
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,776
Now, the five who are on the run,

234
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:04,776
are thought to have an elementary school boy hostage.

235
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:07,576
All because I said something like that to him.

236
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,376
Hey, hey, Mitsuhiko.

237
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:12,476
Are you going to give up just like that?

238
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,376
We'll wait for you.

239
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:15,576
Yes.

240
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,476
But, don't forget, we're going to the convenience store after that.

241
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,076
Thank you.

242
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,876
-Be careful. -Okay!

243
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:25,076
If so, I'm to blame too.

244
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,876
I didn't stop him either.

245
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,576
-Me neither. -Neither did I.

246
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,276
Some hero, my foot.

247
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,077
They're just a bunch of nuisance.

248
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:43,977
I'm pretty sure that Nobuna Gaizer Red was left handed.

249
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:51,976
Yes, but at the site of the crime,

250
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:53,276
he was right handed.

251
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:57,177
The signature pose of Blue and Green were also opposite.

252
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,076
What's going on?

253
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,276
Don't tell me they're...

254
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:06,576
Imposters?

255
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:09,577
Yeah. That's it.

256
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,077
What?

257
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,577
You're members of Nobunga Gaizer?

258
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:31,276
Hello. Everything's okay here.

259
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:33,776
Leave everything else to me.

260
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:36,076
They imposters kidnapped them,

261
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,676
snatched their costumes away

262
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:40,576
and committed the robbery.

263
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:42,576
Those punks...

264
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:45,176
But who on earth?

265
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:47,876
You already have an idea who it might be, right?

266
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:49,676
Would you like to confirm it?

267
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:53,077
Yeah. Dr. Agasa with Detective Matsushiro.

268
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:00,977
Got you. We succeeded.

269
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,477
What did you succeed in doing?

270
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:08,776
Could it be something bad?

271
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,776
Right. You framed the members of Nobuma Gaizer

272
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,776
as the one who committed the robbery. Correct?

273
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:17,777
Host of the hero show Mr. Kimifusa Ohyabu?

274
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,876
"3F, 2F, Ohyabu Event Planning" -Who are all of you?

275
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:23,976
We're members of The Youth Detective Squad!

276
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,676
Where's Mitsuhiko?

277
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,776
What are you talking about?

278
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,176
I don't know anything.

279
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:32,176
No use playing dumb. We've got proof too.

280
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,476
Proof?

281
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:36,076
Nobuna Gaizer red is left handed.

282
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,376
The significant poses of Blue and Green

283
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,276
are in the opposite position too.

284
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,876
You've gotta do more research

285
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:44,176
if you intend to frame them, you know, mister!

286
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:47,377
They just happened to pose differently.

287
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,976
Then, here's another one.

288
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,176
We've got conclusive evidence.

289
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,377
The ring!

290
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,876
You should've taken it off.

291
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,976
Heroes don't wear things like that.

292
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,276
You punched a security guard at the site, didn't you?

293
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:07,176
At that time, the glove tore.

294
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,677
It should match the laceration of the victim.

295
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:14,976
I've reconfirmed by the call from Mr. Agasa.

296
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:18,276
It's true that the glove of the costume is torn.

297
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:21,677
We've got to thoroughly investigate that ring.

298
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,176
I couldn't help it.

299
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,976
The company wasn't doing good

300
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,276
and I was threatened by the collectors

301
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,776
of the loan shark that I borrowed money from.

302
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,476
So the other imposters were people from that loan shark?

303
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,376
Yeah.

304
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,377
I was force to help them.

305
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:44,676
Well, just as would be expected of you, Mr. Agasa.

306
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,076
Well, sort of...

307
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:47,677
I guess.

308
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,676
It's not over yet. Where's Mitsuhiko?

309
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,876
Where's the real Nobuna Gaizer?

310
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:55,776
Where are they?

311
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,876
I don't know.

312
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:00,376
I was told to leave everything else up to them.

313
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,676
It's true!

314
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,876
What? Crap!

315
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,976
What's going on, Conan?

316
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,876
We've got to hurry or he'll be killed

317
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:11,376
along with the heroes, so no evidence is left!

318
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:12,576
-What? -What?

319
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:14,377
Emergency search!

320
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,576
Fire!

321
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,476
We won't make it.

322
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:25,176
We're done for it.

323
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,776
I don't want to die.

324
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:29,776
Don't give up!

325
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,277
The fans of Nobuna Gaizer are waiting!

326
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,377
Conan, what now?

327
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,276
No doubt about it.

328
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:41,276
It's asphalt tar.

329
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,477
Wait! Stop!

330
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,676
Where were you working this morning?

331
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:48,776
A little more. Just a little more.

332
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:49,777
We did it.

333
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:55,176
Somebody! Is there anyone there?

334
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,676
Help us!

335
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:58,276
What now?

336
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,476
We've got to do something.

337
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:00,576
Over there.

338
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:02,377
And then that!

339
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:09,976
"Gifu Castle"

340
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:14,076
They paved the road in the morning.

341
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:16,676
In two places. Over here and over here.

342
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:18,876
They're in totally different directions.

343
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:21,377
I wonder which direction Mitsuhiko's in?

344
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:24,777
What's that?

345
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,476
You'll be fine.

346
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,476
We won't fall no matter what.

347
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:36,276
Believe us.

348
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,776
So, hang in there!

349
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,076
Mitsuhiko!

350
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:40,077
Yes!

351
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,076
Hold on Mitsuhiko!

352
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,476
Darn, we're out of paper.

353
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:50,477
What now?

354
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:53,276
Then, please use that.

Heroes are to be used in times like this!

358
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,577
Over here! He's nearby.

359
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:06,776
This is...

360
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,576
"Local Hero, Nobuna Gaizer" -Mitsuhiko's.

361
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:09,577
Over there.

362
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:13,076
-Mitsuhiko! -Mitsuhiko!

363
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:16,076
Conan! The door's locked.

364
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,177
Okay!

365
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:25,176
All of you... You've all come for us.

366
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,376
I'm happy!

367
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,577
I was scared.

368
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,176
Thank you, Mitsuhiko.

369
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:03,677
You're indeed our hero.

370
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,376
-Thank you. -Thank you.

371
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,476
I'm honored.

372
00:23:09,477 --> 00:23:11,976
The rest of the imposters were arrested

373
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,376
and the treasures of Gifu were also retrieved.

00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:20,576
Mitsuhiko, good work!

377
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:23,076
You're the pride of The Youth Detective Squad.

378
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,576
Why don't you guys where costume too

379
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,776
to become The Youth Detective Squad heroes?

380
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:28,277
The heroes appear!

381
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,476
I'm out.

382
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,876
Me too.

383
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:34,076
Same here.

"Next Episode" -It is also a concern of the Black Organization.

388
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,876
Two odd looking people?

389
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:53,876
Because on that paper, the word Nue was written on it!

390
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,476
Don't tell me that it's in this forest?

391
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,077
You mean that monster that appears in old folklore?

392
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,076
