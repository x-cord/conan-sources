1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,349
While Pops was watching the horse races on TV

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,349
and checking his payout tickets,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,449
we found a dark horse payout ticket he didn't recall buying.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,249
Maybe when he dropped his wallet,

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,049
he picked up someone else's ticket and put it in his wallet?

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,749
I could've accidentally added another digit.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,249
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,949
We're heading to Beika Iroha Sushi next door!

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,349
So the elated Pops dragged us to Beika Iroha Sushi,

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,749
the restaurant next to the detective agency,

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,049
where we met an unfamiliar employee.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,249
Anyway, I don't recognize you.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,349
Are you new?

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,649
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,849
I'm Kanenori Wakita, a cook.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,649
I'm not the type of guy to settle down in one place.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,649
I eventually ended up here.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,249
I'm what you'd call a drifter.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,449
I see.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,949
As we finished eating and were settling our bill,

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,049
a woman ran into the restaurant, claiming her pouch

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,149
had been stolen from her on a full train.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,049
Using the GPS on the phone in her pouch,

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,349
she tracked it down to Iroha Sushi.

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,549
Based on the timing, apparently someone in the restaurant

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,249
was the thief.

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,349
Furthermore...

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,049
"Suzuyo Hijirisawa (47), Victim of Theft" -Just how much was stolen?

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,849
None of the money in my wallet was stolen.

30
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,749
Then who cares?

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,449
But the ticket I had with my cash is missing!

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,049
My dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen!

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,649
What?

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,649
Hey, Dad.

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,650
Huh?

36
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:40,749
Maybe the ticket you picked up belongs to that woman.

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,649
You idiot. There's no way.

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,049
It was stolen about an hour ago.

39
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,649
I was watching the races in my office around then.

40
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,649
But the TV broadcast of the races ended about 50 minutes ago.

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,549
Since you were out buying tickets, you only saw the last race.

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,649
An little over an hour ago, you would've been near the ticket booth.

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,749
I guess you could say that.

44
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,249
Maybe the thief was in a rush to redeem the ticket,

45
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,749
ran into you, and dropped it.

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,149
I guess you could say that.

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,849
And you picked it up and put it in your wallet.

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,949
Maybe you...

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,949
You can't be serious, idiots!

50
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,149
Come to think of it, Kogoro,

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,149
didn't you have a winning dark horse ticket?

52
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,349
Yikes!

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,449
Why don't we make this a contest?

54
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,749
A contest?

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,149
Let's see which of us can find the thief first.

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,249
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

57
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,449
Doesn't that make this an unsolvable case?

58
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,049
Dad!

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,549
What's your problem? I was joking.

60
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,049
That's odd, though.

61
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,849
It's strange that the woman's blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

62
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,649
But why did the thief leave the stolen pouch in the bathroom?

63
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,249
A professional thief would've taken the money

64
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,450
and left the incriminating wallet in a nearby trash can.

65
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,950
So why did they bring it into Iroha Sushi?

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,449
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,449
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,549
A chef and Pops have a detective showdown!

69
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,849
Who hid the dark horse payout ticket?

70
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,549
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,549
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,350
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:27,500
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 2)"

74
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:31,001
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

75
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,400
Since the stolen pouch was left in this bathroom,

76
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:39,100
is there some significance specific to Iroha Sushi?

77
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:43,400
Or would any sushi restaurant have worked?

78
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:47,401
It's that young man's first time at this restaurant.

79
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,100
"Tsunetaka Harashima (25), Customer" -I'll have

80
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:52,500
the nigiri special, some chawanmushi

81
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,000
and a cola.

82
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,100
Hey.

83
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,600
What is it?

84
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,800
Where's your bathroom?

85
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,700
The bathroom's back there.

86
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,901
Thank you.

87
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:09,300
The man sitting next to him seems to have been here before.

88
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:13,400
The regular nigiri and an oolong tea.

89
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,600
"Tameshige Munechika (42), Customer" -Also,

90
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,701
do you have the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today?

91
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:25,201
And that woman seems to be a regular.

92
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,300
What'll it be, miss?

93
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,200
The usual.

94
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:33,600
And what would that be?

95
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,100
You know, the usual.

96
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:38,800
Huh? Where's the regular guy?

97
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,000
He got hurt in a traffic accident.

98
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,400
"Natsume Ashino (33), Customer" -Oh, really?

99
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,200
In that case, I'd like a highball and seafood chirashi.

100
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,600
Extra sea urchin, salmon roe, and wasabi.

101
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,801
You got it.

102
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,600
Hey.

103
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,600
Waiter, I've been wondering...

104
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,400
What is it?

105
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:04,400
Why won't this guy show me his sleeves?

106
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,700
Who, me?

107
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,901
Yeah, you. Aren't you a suspect, too?

108
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,700
I can't listen to this!

109
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,300
That's enough nonsense out of you!

110
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:20,500
The great Kogoro Mouri would never stoop to stealing!

111
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,800
Come on, sir. Show her.

112
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,101
Prove you're innocent.

113
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:29,701
Stains on your sleeve?

114
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:31,800
Wait...

115
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,800
I just happened to spill some soy sauce on myself earlier.

116
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:38,000
Take a closer look.

117
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:41,600
It's more soy sauce colored than blood colored, right? And see?

118
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,900
He's telling the truth.

119
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,900
But it sounds like he's making excuses.

120
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,400
No, seriously. It's true.

121
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,601
-Because he's not totally innocent. -Because he's not totally innocent.

122
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,800
Enough! Just confess already!

123
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,400
Who did it?

124
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:02,301
Who stole my pouch on the train?

125
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:06,600
I didn't even take the train today.

126
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,601
I walked here.

127
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,600
I took the bus.

128
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't like full trains.

129
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,500
I took a taxi.

130
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:19,601
It's just the base fare from my office to here.

131
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,100
Then I don't have a choice.

132
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,900
It was careless of me to celebrate

133
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,000
my dark horse payout ticket on the train.

134
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,501
I was willing to forgive you if you came clean.

135
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:37,100
But now I'll have to go through the police.

136
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,600
And I'm sure you'd prefer to get the police involved

137
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:44,200
so you can erase all doubt, right?

138
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,501
Involved... and erase?

139
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:50,000
That's it! I forgot!

140
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:55,900
The police will only have to search your belongings.

141
00:08:55,901 --> 00:09:02,700
After all, the person who has either a million yen in cash

142
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:07,601
or the stolen dark horse ticket on them is the thief.

143
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:16,700
Actually, there's no need to call the police.

144
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:20,701
The thief's already a carp on a cutting board.

145
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:26,601
All that's left is for me to name them and for them to confess.

146
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,000
Name the thief?

147
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,500
You mean you know who did it?

148
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,500
I sure do. I know who stole your pouch on the train,

149
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:42,000
brazenly came to eat sushi at this restaurant,

150
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:48,601
and hid that pouch in the bathroom.

151
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,900
Then you must have figured that out, too.

152
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,500
Figured what out?

153
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:02,700
When my pouch was stolen, I grabbed the thief's sleeve

154
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,500
with my finger wrapped in a bloodstained band-aid.

155
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:11,600
But for some reason that blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

156
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,400
Of course.

157
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:17,500
The thief passed through this restaurant's shop curtains

158
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:20,400
to erase that blood.

159
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:25,300
But I'm sure Kogoro has already figured that out.

160
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:26,301
Huh?

161
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,600
Let's leave the mystery solving to the professionals.

162
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's see one of your detective shows.

163
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,901
I have no idea what you're talking about.

164
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,900
Seriously? So the Sleeping Kogoro's nothing special.

165
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,100
What?

166
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:53,900
I learned a lot about food while working as a chef.

167
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,400
-Miss. -Yes?

168
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,500
Do you know why they put ginger in ginger fried pork?

169
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,100
Um...

170
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,200
It's not because it's called ginger fried pork.

171
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,800
Because it tastes better?

172
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,700
That's not the only reason.

173
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,400
Ginger breaks down proteins.

174
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:19,100
They put it in to soften the meat.

175
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:22,400
And protein is found in blood, too.

176
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,400
It's difficult to wash bloodstains out of clothes

177
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,600
because the proteins in them stick to the fibers.

178
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:33,700
If you wash bloodstained clothes with ginger juice,

179
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:36,400
the stains will come right out.

180
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:39,100
Really? I'll try it next time.

181
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,300
Wait. Doesn't that mean...

182
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:47,400
That's right. We serve thinly sliced ginger pickled in sweet vinegar.

183
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,901
So the man who ordered a mountain of pickled ginger...

184
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:55,700
That makes you the thief.

185
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,300
When you went to the bathroom

186
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:01,000
to hide the pouch hidden in your jacket,

187
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,300
didn't you pour the juice from the pickled ginger on your sleeve

188
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,800
to wash out the stain?

189
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:11,101
Hold on! I seriously didn't steal anything!

190
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,100
Don't play dumb!

191
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,500
Didn't you say

192
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,200
you wanted to leave because there's a show you want to watch?

193
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah.

194
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:22,900
Kogoro and his family came

195
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,200
after the horse races ended just after 4pm.

196
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:32,800
This woman barged in here about an hour later at 5pm.

197
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:38,900
You said you wanted to leave after the argument about the theft,

198
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:41,100
so that would've been around 5.30pm.

199
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,600
If you walked here, it probably takes you

200
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,200
less than 30 minutes to get home.

201
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:51,800
The only shows on around that time are cartoons and kids shows.

202
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:56,000
I wanted...

203
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,400
to see a kid's show.

204
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,800
Masked Yaiba!

205
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:05,000
The enemy boss's adviser is supposed to be on today's episode!

206
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,400
"Masked Yaiba"

207
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,200
Huh? Masked...

208
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,201
Yaiba?

209
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,300
And you're so into it, you don't want to miss it?

210
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,900
This Masked whatever show?

211
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

212
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:21,000
Besides, I don't know exactly how it works,

213
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,800
but wouldn't my sleeve be the color of pickled ginger

214
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,000
if I poured its juice on my sleeve?

215
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,900
Though I'm sure the color would come out

216
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,100
if I washed it right after this.

217
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,900
You're right.

218
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,700
Then go ahead and search my belongings.

219
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't have a million yen or a dark horse payout ticket.

220
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,500
Come on! You guys show them, too!

221
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,000
Then we'll know who the thief is.

222
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,200
Right, mister?

223
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, but...

224
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,600
You, too, old lady!

225
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,400
How rude! I'm not that old!

226
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:52,400
Who cares? Just show them what you've got!

227
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:55,801
If you don't have the ticket, you're innocent!

228
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,000
Excuse me!

229
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,301
I know who has the dark horse payout ticket!

230
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,304
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

231
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:14,804
Hey, you.

232
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,404
Is that true?

233
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,404
Well, actually...

234
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,304
Dad, let me see your wallet.

235
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,504
Wait, Ran!

236
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:26,804
My dad ran into someone at the ticket booth.

237
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:31,004
He accidentally put a ticket that was on the ground in his wallet.

238
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,404
Sheesh.

239
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,605
So...

240
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:37,004
I'm sorry!

241
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:39,205
You're hopeless.

242
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,004
"Yamanaka 9 Race" -What is this?

243
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,504
"Win, 8 Pirate's Spirit" -This is a win ticket.

244
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,104
-Huh? -What?

245
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:49,904
I bet five thousand on a quinella ticket for first and second place.

246
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,704
Its payout is two-hundredfold, so it's worth a million yen.

247
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,904
You shouldn't mislead people like that.

248
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,704
Sorry.

249
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,904
This is stupid.

250
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,504
I'm leaving.

251
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:02,604
Hey, you.

252
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:05,004
-We're not finished... -Let me through.

253
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,404
Then I'm leaving, too.

254
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,604
-Huh? -Me, too.

255
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,404
-Hey! -Move.

256
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,404
Wait! You're running away?

257
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,805
-Calm down, everyone. -I guess I don't have a choice.

258
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:22,105
The dark horse payout ticket was a quinella ticket?

259
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,704
Hold it right there!

260
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,305
Dad?

261
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,504
Since you said you like mysteries,

262
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:39,104
I thought I'd see what you could do.

263
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,704
But you still have a lot of learn, detective drifter.

264
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:43,705
Huh?

265
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:47,204
Ginger does contain protease,

266
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:50,504
an enzyme that breaks down proteins.

267
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:54,005
But ginger isn't the only thing they're found in.

268
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,304
It's also found in radishes.

269
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:00,704
If you wrap grated radish in a handkerchief,

270
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:03,804
gently pat the front and back of a bloodstain,

271
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,204
and then place a tissue over it,

272
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,104
the blood will transfer to the tissue.

273
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,504
Repeat the process three or four times,

274
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:13,704
and the bloodstain disappears completely.

275
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,904
And unlike pickled ginger, it doesn't leave any color.

276
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:20,704
Isn't that what you did inside the bathroom?

277
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:21,904
Hey!

278
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:24,304
The man who ordered the grilled fish,

279
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:26,505
which always comes with grated radish...

280
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,004
I'm talking to you!

281
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:33,704
But maybe he happened to see it on the menu

282
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:36,104
and wanted some grilled fish.

283
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:39,704
It's a dish sushi restaurants rarely serve.

284
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,305
No, when he ordered...

285
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,104
Also, do you have

286
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,405
the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today, too?

287
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,204
He asked about the food.

288
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:54,804
It proves he's been here before and knows you serve grilled fish.

289
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,404
And only an amateur

290
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:02,204
would bring a stolen pouch all the way here.

291
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,704
One who never imagined the victim

292
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:08,705
would use their phone's GPS to track him all the way here.

293
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:13,304
Who stole my pouch?

294
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:16,205
I know the thief is in here.

295
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,804
So why did you come here

296
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,704
to remove the bloodstain on your sleeve?

297
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:26,704
You could've returned home and taken off your shirt or thrown it away.

298
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,304
Why?

299
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,204
Because he had something to do after this

300
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:34,904
that didn't allow him to have a bloodstain on his sleeve.

301
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:39,204
That young man with the TV show he doesn't want to miss

302
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,704
and the woman who wants to go home to participate in online auctions

303
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:46,404
would have no problem with a bloodstain on their sleeve.

304
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:48,804
But not so for that bespectacled man on his way

305
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:53,104
to meet someone for drinks at an expensive restaurant.

306
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,504
On top of that, he's meeting his in-laws,

307
00:17:56,505 --> 00:18:01,204
who are so strict he's too nervous to eat around them.

308
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,504
Who knows what they'd say

309
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,504
if he showed up with blood on his sleeve?

310
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:12,104
But that doesn't prove I'm the thief.

311
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:16,804
No, you've already confessed that you are.

312
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,104
I haven't admitted to anything!

313
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,704
You said you came by bus.

314
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:23,504
Why didn't you take the train?

315
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,704
I said I don't like full trains.

316
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,004
Surely there are empty trains.

317
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:33,105
But she was riding in... a full train.

318
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:39,204
How do you know the train she was in was full?

319
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,604
Because...

320
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:46,405
Because you were on that train, too. Right?

321
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,404
I don't get it.

322
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,604
Why would a rich guy like you on his way to drinks

323
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,504
at an expensive restaurant steal?

324
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,104
It's my wife's parents who are rich.

325
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:10,804
My wife wanted for nothing growing up with them.

326
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,104
Her spending habits haven't changed,

327
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:16,304
and I can't afford it on my salary.

328
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,204
My savings have been drained, and I'm in debt.

329
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:23,104
While I was wondering if I should borrow money

330
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:26,004
from her parents that I'm about to see,

331
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,004
I heard her.

332
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:30,204
No way. I won.

333
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:31,904
Won what?

334
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,604
My dark horse payout ticket.

335
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,204
It's a million yen.

336
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,204
-What? -All right!

337
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:41,505
So I acted without thinking out of desperation.

338
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,804
I gave in to temptation.

339
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:57,805
I'm sorry!

340
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,204
Excuse me.

341
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,704
Is it all right if I answer?

342
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:10,204
It's probably my wife.

343
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,804
Sure, go ahead.

344
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,905
Thank you.

345
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,304
Hello, honey?

346
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:21,904
The restaurant we're at has a vintage Romanee-Conti.

347
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:24,905
Can I treat my parents?

348
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:27,804
No.

349
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:28,904
What?

350
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,604
We can't afford it!

351
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,904
Have a beer and come home!

352
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:37,804
Oh, also, I need to go see the police now.

353
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:39,404
I won't be going to the restaurant.

354
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,804
The police?

355
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,605
Wait! What do you mean, the police...

356
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:48,305
Maybe I should've said that from the start.

357
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,804
I know I just stole from someone else,

358
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,704
but I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.

359
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:59,104
I've actually never bought a payout ticket before.

360
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:04,805
I had no idea where or how to exchange it for cash.

361
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:10,104
30 minutes later, the police arrived at the restaurant.

362
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:13,104
Munechika was taken away

363
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,304
with the slightly cheerful expression

364
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:19,105
of a man who's just finished a meal.

365
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:44,304
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

366
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,905
I underestimated you, Sleeping Kogoro!

367
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:51,204
Dad?

368
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,604
Huh?

369
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,804
Please make me your apprentice.

370
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:57,904
Apprentice?

371
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:02,104
I'll give you a discount on your sushi.

372
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:04,105
In that case, okay!

373
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:07,905
He's got another apprentice.

374
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,404
Later...

375
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:14,004
"Beika-cho Fifth Street Police Box" -Do I really have to turn it in?

376
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:17,204
No one's going to claim it.

377
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:18,705
Yes!

378
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:25,104
But no one's going to claim it.

379
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,505
Yes!

380
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,405
-But... -Yes!

381
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:35,805
Pops turned over his dark horse payout ticket to a police box.

382
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:40,505
You've gotta turn in lost items.

383
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,404
"Next Episode"

384
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:48,805
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

385
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,104
Huh?

386
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,405
The folding screen!

387
00:23:56,605 --> 00:24:00,205
Let's tie him up and put him on display!

388
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:04,205
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

389
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:08,804
Next Conan,

390
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:12,505
"The Woman with White Hands (Part 1)"
