1
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:06,706
All right, let me introduce her.

2
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:14,506
She will be joining our class as of today.

3
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,906
This is Sera.

4
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,106
Sera?

5
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,006
A transfer student?

6
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,806
What the... she's wearing a skirt.

7
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:30,106
A girl?

8
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,706
My name is Masumi Sera.

9
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,006
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,606
If all cases were men,

11
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,406
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

12
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,106
The Mouri Detective Agency is being targeted.

13
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:02,206
What's the demand of the culprit who holed himself up?

14
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:03,806
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,806
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:07,706
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:38,334
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Outbreak)"

18
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:40,534
So, say...

19
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:42,934
Sera, where do you live?

20
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,134
Well, for right now I'm living at a hotel, I guess.

21
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:47,834
Where are you from?

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,534
I'd been living with my parents in America since three years ago,

23
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,734
but I rebelled, saying that I'd rather live in Japan

24
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,534
where I was born and raised,

25
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,534
so I came back to Tokyo.

26
00:02:57,534 --> 00:03:00,734
It's easier to be a detective here, too.

27
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,734
So you're a detective, Sera?

28
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,734
A female Kudo.

29
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:05,734
Kudo?

30
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,434
The pride of Teitan High here,

31
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,734
he's a high school detective.

32
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,634
A renowned detective.

33
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:14,434
Although, right now he's in leave of absence.

34
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,434
Sera sure is popular, right?

35
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,634
You're right.

36
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:25,834
She's cheerful, sociable, boyish, and cute.

37
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,234
On top of it,

38
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,234
she's a female detective who uses Jeet Kune-Do

39
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,634
and evenly-matched with you.

40
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,334
Maybe she's a tomboy too.

41
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,734
Well, the only thing that's left to be desired are her small breasts.

42
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,934
I'm sorry for being flat-chested then.

43
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,534
But...

44
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:44,534
My mom's bosoms are pretty huge,

45
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:47,434
so mine should eventually develop, right?

46
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,234
I guess...

47
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,434
You're right.

48
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:54,934
Anyway, is it true that Conan is living at Mr. Mouri's place?

49
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,434
Yes, it's true.

50
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,734
Then is it all right if I came over?

51
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:03,234
Sure, but if I recall, today Conan is...

52
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,934
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Oh, no.

53
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,034
He just left now?

54
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,834
Was it to that Dr. What's-his-name's house?

55
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,934
Yes, since they're going camping early tomorrow morning,

56
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,634
he said he's staying over there with the other brats tonight.

57
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:19,634
Darn. By the slightest of margins?

58
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,634
Who is this girl?

59
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,234
Sera, a transfer student.

60
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,634
She says she's a detective.

61
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,034
A female high school detective?

62
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,834
Then, have you heard of the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri here?

63
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,834
Yes. Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,634
When I checked the Japanese news via the internet,

65
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,434
your name came up frequently.

66
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:43,234
Sera said she was living in America up until recently.

67
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,734
I read that you've resolved tons of difficult cases.

68
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,534
Yes, got that right.

69
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:52,434
And the one who's always with you

70
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:55,934
is Conan Edogawa, isn't it?

71
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,534
Yes... well...

72
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:02,234
So then, why don't you have dad tell you all about his cases?

73
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:05,434
You'd think so, but I can't remember most of them.

74
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,634
As a detective, I'd love to hear some stories

75
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,334
but it can wait until next time.

76
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:15,134
I'll listen to all there is to say when Conan is around.

77
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,634
About your stories,

78
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:22,234
please tell us every single detail.

79
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,434
"Tamami Mitsui (41)" -The three of us

80
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:27,434
are popular female mystery writers.

81
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:30,634
"Shinobu Yuchi (36)" -And we're friends who met via SNS.

82
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,034
"Sumika Nihei (39)" -We were told that we could hear

83
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:36,034
the stories of the Great Detective Mouri if we came here today.

84
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,734
Didn't you hear about it from Mr. Sawaguri?

85
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,634
Well, first of all, what is SNS?

86
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,134
Social Networking Service.

87
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,434
The stuff on the internet

88
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,234
where you can communicate with a variety of people.

89
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:51,434
Excuse me, could that Ms. Sawaguri you're referring

90
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,734
to be the mystery writer Miku Sawaguri who passed away last month?

91
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:59,434
Yes, she was also one of our SNS buddies.

92
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,434
But the one who invited us here today is...

93
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,934
her elder brother...

94
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:07,034
Right.

95
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,034
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Yours truly.

96
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,434
Mr. Sawaguri.

97
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,734
What's going on?

98
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:17,134
It seems they haven't heard of the arrangement.

99
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,034
But of course.

100
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,134
Cause I never made an appointment.

101
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,734
Each of you, put your cell phones on the desk

102
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,534
and go to the far wall now.

103
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,834
-What's this? -All about?

104
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,334
Don't mess around. Do it now!

105
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,534
-Yes. -Yes...

106
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,534
I'll take the feet.

107
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,934
You, the gun.

108
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:49,834
And we'll overpower that guy, okay?

109
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:50,834
Hey.

110
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,434
Once you've put it down, get going!

111
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,634
Yes, yes.

112
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,334
Hey, you.

113
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:05,234
What the heck is this about?

114
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:07,334
Better let go.

115
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:13,434
I did hear you have a daughter who is adept at karate, but...

116
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,834
Never thought there'd be two of them.

117
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:20,634
I was right to come with these strapped on.

118
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:32,234
Now... Let's hear your brilliant deduction, Sleeping Kogoro.

119
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:38,234
Then, that detective named Sera,

120
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:42,234
knew your name as well as the fact that you were a detective?

121
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,434
Yes.

122
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,434
Well, he could just be a fan who became interested

123
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,234
after learning about you from the papers and such.

124
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:53,534
Besides, you were the one who figured out the truth

125
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,434
of the case in the end, weren't you?

126
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,934
So much for being a detective.

127
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,734
You're right.

128
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,034
Although I somehow feel

129
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,534
as if that wannabe already figured out the truth,

130
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:06,334
made a mistake on purpose in order to get me to deduce it.

131
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,334
Hold on.

132
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,934
You went ahead and began your deduction

133
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,934
using Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of someone that suspicious?

134
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:16,334
Well... I couldn't think of anything else to do.

135
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:19,634
Besides, rather than being an enemy,

136
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:23,234
somehow it feels like we've met somewhere before.

137
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:26,634
Perhaps that person resembles someone I know

138
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,534
that's why I feel as if we've met before.

139
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,634
What's on your mind, exactly?

140
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,034
No.

141
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,334
Speaking of on my mind,

142
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,334
the high school student that Ran was with...

143
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:40,534
Yes, some guy we don't know, right?

144
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,034
Ran was with a guy you don't know?

145
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,234
We saw them across the street from us

146
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:46,034
when we were coming here.

147
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:49,034
But, wasn't that person a girl?

148
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,434
Was it or not?

149
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,134
If that's on your mind,

150
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:54,434
why don't you call and find out?

151
00:08:55,834 --> 00:09:00,734
The loud noise just now was from a detective drama,

152
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:04,734
the volume got stuck for a bit, but we got it fixed.

153
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:08,634
Yes, I do apologize for the trouble.

154
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,434
All right, that's fine.

155
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,334
Now, great detective,

156
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,734
you'll grant my wish.

157
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,634
That's my cell phone.

158
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:24,934
Darn. You didn't turn it off?

159
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,434
If you make the wrong move and turn it off,

160
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:27,634
they'll suspect you.

161
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,734
What?

162
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,434
The other side knows it's turned on and ringing,

163
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,434
so if no one picks it up, they may worry

164
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,734
and come to check on her.

165
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,634
I think it's best to just answer appropriately, and then hang up.

166
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,534
Guess so.

167
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:45,234
But in exchange, if you even let slip one word...

168
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,934
We know already.

169
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,934
Hello.

170
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,134
Ran? It's me.

171
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,834
Did I call at a bad time?

172
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,634
It's all right.

173
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:58,134
It's just that I was in the restroom.

174
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:00,334
Well, it's not a big deal,

175
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,134
but Genta and the others

176
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,734
told me that you were walking with some guy they didn't know.

177
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:09,234
Walking with some guy they didn't know?

178
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,834
I guess you mean the one who just transferred today...

179
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,334
It was me!

180
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,734
Why her?

181
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,034
So now you know,

182
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,534
just enjoy camping tomorrow.

183
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,334
That should do it, right?

184
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:27,234
Put the phone back on the desk and move back.

185
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,234
Sure thing.

186
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,734
Regardless...

187
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,334
the request you just spoke of...

188
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,834
Can you tell it to us again?

189
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,734
It was kinda complicated,

190
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,734
so I couldn't quite catch on hearing it only once.

191
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,434
Hey. So who was that guy?

192
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,134
-Please tell us. -Conan.

193
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,234
This cell phone...

194
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,234
is still connected.

195
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:57,334
Geez, very well.

196
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,034
I'll explain it once more,

197
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,134
so you'd better listen up.

198
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,434
My sister Miku Sawaguri,

199
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:04,534
was a best selling author

200
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:07,734
who won the Naomoto Award when she was still young.

201
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,634
But last month she killed herself by slitting her wrist

202
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:10,834
at a Gunma hot spring inn, or so,

203
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,234
the freaking police said.

204
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,834
However, I swear it wasn't suicide.

205
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,434
She was killed by one of the three who went to the hot spring with her.

206
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,734
As for something that might be of evidence

207
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,234
I've brought it here.

208
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:31,134
So I want you to solve it, Sleeping Kogoro,

209
00:11:31,134 --> 00:11:33,934
with your brilliant deduction.

210
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,934
Well, you don't have to worry.

211
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:40,934
Once the culprit is found, I'll kill the witch

212
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,534
and disappear to the other side myself as well.

213
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,534
What?

214
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:50,634
Although, there is a limit to how long I can stay awake.

215
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,634
Come tomorrow morning,

216
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:55,634
these bombs will go off, though.

217
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,634
What now?

218
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,590
So what the man wanted solved

219
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,790
was the truth behind the suicide of his sister,

220
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,290
mystery writer Miku Sawaguri?

221
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,990
What's more, that man has bombs on him,

222
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,190
and intends to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

223
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,790
once he finds out who, right?

224
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,390
Yes, that man also said...

225
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,290
that it'll explode in the morning,

226
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,990
so the bombs may be time bombs.

227
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,990
No way.

228
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,290
Ran is there too, isn't she?

229
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,890
Aren't they in big trouble?

230
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,790
Haibara, does it say online what hot spring inn it was

231
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,290
that Miku Sawaguri supposedly committed suicide at?

232
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,990
Yes, the date of the incident was last month on the 4th.

233
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,790
And there are photos of the three novelists who went there with her.

234
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,690
That inn...

235
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,490
It seems that man who's locked himself inside the detective agency

236
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,990
was also there as well.

237
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,590
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Since he, who was staying in the next room,

238
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,390
seem to have been the primary discoverer of the body.

239
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,690
He got an email from his sister saying goodbye,

240
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,590
thought it strange and went to knock on the door,

241
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,090
but received no response.

242
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,790
Without a choice, he broke the window via her balcony

243
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,590
and entered her room

244
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,090
to find that it had been enshrouded in steam.

245
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,190
And with her slit wrist soaked in the bathtub,

246
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,790
his sister was found dead holding tightly

247
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,190
onto her room key and cell phone,

248
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,390
according to his testimony.

249
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,190
The entrance door to the room was not an auto-lock type,

250
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,990
but the one that requires the turning of the key.

251
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,890
So basically it was a perfectly sealed room, wasn't it?

252
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,590
Then, why did that man insist it was a murder?

253
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,390
Could the name of the inn happen to be Furitsukaya?

254
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Yes.

255
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,290
So it's the same hot spring inn the owner of Poirot went to

256
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,690
last month with people from the neighborhood association.

257
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,790
-What? -What?

258
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,190
Do you know who's in the neighborhood association?

259
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,190
Yes, because the owner sent me the photo

260
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,090
of everyone who was there back then.

261
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,690
Then, you guys go and find the people in the photo

262
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,690
except the owner, and ask about

263
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,490
what those three were up to before and after the incident.

264
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,490
-Yes. -Yes.

265
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,190
But, what about the owner?

266
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,690
The owner is in the coffee shop Poirot,

267
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,090
which is directly beneath the detective agency.

268
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,490
We'll call the police

269
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,390
to evacuate the owner and the customers,

270
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,290
so do not go anywhere near there no matter what.

271
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,090
But isn't she something?

272
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,390
Your girl at the detective agency.

273
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,890
She stuck her strap mascot in the cell phone

274
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,890
and then pretended that she'd hung up the phone

275
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,790
in order to keep the connection, right?

276
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,290
No, it wasn't Ran who did that.

277
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,390
Somehow that person is also at the detective agency,

278
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,790
the one we spoke about...

279
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,090
That detective named Sera.

280
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,990
All right, Kogoro Mouri.

281
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,890
Isn't it about time you enlighten me about the truth behind this case?

282
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,390
Which of the three people here killed my little sister?

283
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,890
But look here,

284
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,890
according to this copy of the newspaper,

285
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,490
the scene was a perfect sealed room.

286
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,490
What's more, the one who proved it was yourself,

287
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,790
the primary discoverer of the body.

288
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,290
Where are you getting that it was a murder?

289
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,390
I heard a sound.

290
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,590
When I found my sister passed out

291
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,490
and called an ambulance with my cell,

292
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,190
I heard a crunchy sound near the window.

293
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,590
So, I checked out the window,

294
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,590
and saw some small glass fragments

295
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,690
on the balcony outside of the window.

296
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,990
But I broke the glass of the window from the outside,

297
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,290
so isn't that weird?

298
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,090
That must be proof

299
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,890
that the culprit was hiding somewhere in the room,

300
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,490
waited until my attention was on my sister

301
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,090
and snuck out from that broken window.

302
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,690
But are you sure those fragments

303
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,690
weren't from your stepping on them before going outside the window?

304
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,690
Since you were in a rush to look around.

305
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,290
The police said the same thing,

306
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,090
but I know I never stepped outside the window back then.

307
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,890
Are you the type to act without considering the consequences

308
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,390
when things get intense?

309
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes, my buddies often say that I'm a quick-tempered guy.

310
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,390
In that case, your deduction may not be completely off the mark.

311
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,790
For these ladies who knew about you,

312
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,890
could have taken advantage of your apparent personality.

313
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,590
Plus, just take a look.

314
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,590
The photo I took before the police came.

315
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,690
You see the bloody finger marks on the bathmat there

316
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,690
in front of the bathroom door?

317
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,690
Sure... looks to be so.

318
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,190
That's probably

319
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,090
since my sister had her wrist slit by the culprit in the bathroom,

320
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,690
and struggled with all her might to escape.

321
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,990
Thus, left these bloody marks.

322
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,090
Otherwise, how would the blood have gotten all the way over there.

323
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,490
But, to suspect those three just from that...

324
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,590
Before the incident occurred,

325
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,990
all three of them had been to my sister's room.

326
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,090
Isn't that right?

327
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,890
Yes.

328
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,890
Including Miku, the four of us had made a pact,

329
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,190
that the first person who hit one million sales

330
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,890
would treat the others to a hot spring trip.

331
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,390
Since it was Miku who had become a bestselling author.

332
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,290
We were hyping over SNS about how we might

333
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,290
as well have her sign the first edition books

334
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,290
she'd given us of her debut work at the inn.

335
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,990
That's why we each went to visit her at her room that day.

336
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,990
Though, it seems that the three of us

337
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,890
coincidentally missed each other in passing.

338
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,090
You've brought those books with you, no?

339
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,190
Yes.

340
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,390
Incidentally, how did you get them to bring those books here?

341
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,090
I lied to them about you and my sister being acquaintances.

342
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,390
Telling them that if they wanted to hear your stories,

343
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,990
they'd have to bring those books

344
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,690
as proof that they were my sister's close friends.

345
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,290
Here, take a look.

346
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,290
She even dated her autograph.

347
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,290
It's proof that these three met with my sister

348
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,290
on the date of the incident.

349
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,990
In addition, my sister posted live updates via SNS

350
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,690
of what was happening at the time.

351
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,190
Here's a copy of those postings.

352
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,890
However, if these people were all SNS buddies,

353
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,190
wouldn't they have seen those postings?

354
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,090
No, my sister used my ID to post them discreetly.

355
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,390
So that these people wouldn't see them.

356
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,290
That reminds me, when I went to her room.

357
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,490
She kept texting on the phone.

358
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,690
So she was actually posting?

359
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,890
Anyway, read it.

360
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,490
Let's see.

361
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,890
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

362
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,590
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

363
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,590
that pesky Elephant.

364
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,890
What is this Elephant?

365
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,490
My sister made a hobby out of comparing people to animals.

366
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,890
Just read on, will you?

367
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,890
Next to come was Fox.

368
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,190
Trying to stir up an argument again,

369
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,390
freaking annoying.

370
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,490
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

371
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,490
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

372
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,790
I'll make short work of the autograph

373
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,790
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

374
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,690
Darn, she's still here.

375
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,690
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

376
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,690
What should I do?

377
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,690
And it seems the postings end there.

378
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,790
So, you got it, right?

379
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,990
That my sister, who left such postings,

380
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,290
wouldn't have any reason to commit suicide.

381
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,590
And that one of these three here was the last to see my sister,

382
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,790
put her to sleep,

383
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,690
and kill her while making it look like suicide,

384
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,790
that goddamned Rat.

385
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,690
Elephant, Fox, and Rat?

386
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,390
We got to figure out the criteria the late Miku used

387
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,690
to assign those nicknames, or else.

388
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,690
If you want the profiles of those three novelists,

389
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,190
there are details along with their photos.

390
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,790
Are those three people that famous?

391
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,790
No, all three of them

392
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,190
merely upload novels online as a hobby,

393
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,390
and are amateurs who occasionally create a coterie magazine to sell.

394
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,890
They call themselves novelists uploaded websites,

395
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,690
that's why they were listed.

396
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,290
Tamae Mitsui is 41 years old,

397
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,390
never married, and has been helping

398
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,490
at her family's stone dealer's business.

399
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,890
She's a Taurus, blood type A.

400
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,990
Shinobu Yuchi is 36, and divorced once.

401
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,190
She's been working at her neighbourhood bakery

402
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,290
for close to 20 years, a Pisces, type B.

403
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,690
Sumika Nihei, age 39,

404
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,390
her husband is a seal cutting craftsman,

405
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,590
and in her spare time, as a housewife,

406
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,490
she writes mysteries, a Leo, type O.

407
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,790
Incidentally, I also looked up Miku's elder brother Sawaguri,

408
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,990
Turns out he was the leader of a survival games team,

409
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,690
the team's name is Green Cap.

410
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,090
A parody of the US Army's Special Forces Green Berets?

411
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,690
Just going by how these people look,

412
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,090
I'd say Elephant would be Mitsui,

413
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,490
Rat would be Yuchi,

414
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,390
and Fox would be Nihei, but...

415
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,590
It's too early to say for sure not a lot of info to go on.

416
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,090
As far as those three...

417
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,190
We've brought some answers.

418
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,590
The whole scoop!

419
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,390
You should be thankful to these children.

420
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,590
They bustled about the whole town in the Beetle, gathering info.

421
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,790
So, what'd you find out?

422
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,190
The lanky woman with the glasses is an extremely polite person.

423
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,990
We heard that she willingly tidied up

424
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,390
after some kids she didn't know scattered shampoo

425
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,590
and conditioner here and there.

426
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,890
The short woman with the overbite loves hot springs.

427
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,590
It seems she went into the hot springs many times a day.

428
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,890
The most suspicious one is the fat woman.

429
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,190
She was rushing out of the dead lady's room with a pale face.

430
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,590
According to a guy who saw her from his slightly-opened door.

431
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,590
Was the guy who witnessed that

432
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,790
in the room directly opposite from the late Miku's?

433
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,790
No, he was in the room three rooms away

434
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,590
from hers on the same side.

435
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,090
When he was about to leave his room,

436
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,590
he said that woman ran towards him with a scary look,

437
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,590
so he immediately shut the door.

438
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,290
We even brought a picture of the commotion that happened after that.

439
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,090
We're told that it's a picture of when the police arrived to room 205,

440
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,290
the scene of the suicide.

441
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,390
So no one told this to the police?

442
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,590
Apparently people did,

443
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,990
but they were told by Inspector Yamamura

444
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,390
that since the scene is a sealed room, that is irrelevant.

445
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,090
That's right.

446
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,290
The Gunma Prefectural Police has that hack on the force.

447
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,890
Hey... why is this phone still connected?

448
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,690
Darn, he found out.

449
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,490
Darn.

450
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,390
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

451
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,690
You've got quite the nerve.

452
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,990
You do know what's going to happen, right?

453
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,590
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

454
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,690
It was me.

455
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,490
I was the one who made her do it.

456
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,390
Shinichi Kudo did.

457
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,990
Shinichi.

458
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,390
Why is he on Conan's phone?

459
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,890
First to come was the Special Investigation Team

460
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,790
made up of the Criminal Investigation Department First Division,

461
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,090
abbreviated as SIT.

462
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,790
I'm convinced that someone among these three

463
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,090
is the Rat who killed my sister.

464
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,390
Looks like we'll have to use an alternative method.

465
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,890
This guy... Don't tell me...

466
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,990
Now.

467
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,490
Shoot.

468
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,990
Next Conan,

469
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,090
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Sniping)"

470
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,890
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,190
"Bush warbler".

472
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,890
Excuse me, will you show me Sleeping Kogoro?

473
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,890
Well, let me see.

474
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,990
Don't know.
