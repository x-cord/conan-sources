1
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:08,153
That restaurant was surprisingly good.

2
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:11,053
Yeah, and that kind of price for lunch,

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,553
-it's a real bargain, right? -Right!

4
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,453
Look Out!

5
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,553
Darn you!

6
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,053
Oh no!

7
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,353
Are you all right?

8
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,753
Yes, thank you very much.

9
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:56,253
Like the fog clears.

10
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,453
Let's see through love and crime as well.

11
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,553
A Japanese style mansion with complicated contraptions.

12
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,353
An incident occurs at the Red Leaves Palace.

13
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,053
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,953
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,153
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:53,177
"Solving the Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 1)"

17
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,759
Wow, somehow I feel sorry for troubling you guys!

18
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,459
To think you'd invite us to your house

19
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,959
despite us not doing much.

20
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,459
Since we were saved by the renowned great detective Kogoro Mouri,

21
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,759
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -our master insisted

22
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,059
upon meeting with you to express his gratitude.

23
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,459
Doesn't this road...

24
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,459
lead to the Red Leaf Palace?

25
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,359
That's my grandpa's house!

26
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,659
What? Is that case, is she really that real estate king

27
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,559
Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's granddaughter?

28
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,159
No, they are not blood related.

29
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,559
Her parents died in a traffic accident.

30
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,759
And he recently adopted her

31
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,759
from her relatives living in Hokkaido.

32
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,959
My name is Kaede Nakakita, eight years old!

33
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,259
Nice to meet you!

34
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,459
And you?

35
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,759
I'm Conan Edogawa.

36
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,759
I'm seven years old.

37
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,259
Please come in.

38
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,859
Red leaves everywhere, I see.

39
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:33,059
Who are those people, Suzaka?

40
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,859
Milady Nobue.

41
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,259
The truth is that we were saved from harm's way by these people.

42
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,359
We were almost hit by a freak car!

43
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,559
Thanks to this fine boy who called out to us.

44
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,659
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter of Katayose"

45
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,459
A freak car, huh?

46
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,859
I see.

47
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,659
Did someone drop by?

48
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,159
Big brother.

49
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:03,659
They say Kaede almost got into an accident with a freak car.

50
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:04,959
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son of Katayose" -Accident?

51
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,359
Bet it's because you were walking carelessly.

52
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,759
And? Who're you guys?

53
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,059
He's the one who saved us back then.

54
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,659
The great detective Kogoro Mouri.

55
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,859
Kogoro Mouri?

56
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,559
The...

57
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,459
That freak car was your doing, no?

58
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,359
Were you driving the car?

59
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,859
My car's still inside the garage!

60
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,359
You're so adept at things like that,

61
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,359
you could've used a stolen car.

62
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,459
The garden fence! You put a hole in it, didn't you?

63
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,859
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,159
On the other side of the fence is a deep valley.

65
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,659
Kaede likes to play around there, doesn't she?

66
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,559
Kaede, that is.

67
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,659
Oh, my bad.

68
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,659
We both come from different mothers.

69
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,059
We're both adopted children who survived our deceased mothers.

70
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:55,959
We're not blood related to our father.

71
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,459
In a household like this, problems are bound to happen.

72
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,859
That's what's on your mind, isn't it?

73
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:05,759
No worries, Detective Mouri will help us capture

74
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,459
the culprit who made a hole in the fence!

75
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,859
The driver behind the wheel of that weird car!

76
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:20,859
My sincerest apologies for your having to hear something like this.

77
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:24,559
-Oh, no. -Well, please come in.

78
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,859
The head of the household has been waiting for you.

79
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,859
-Come on in, Conan! -Yeah.

80
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,859
This sure is a spacious manor.

81
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:41,359
I wonder how much further this corridor goes.

82
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,259
What's this?

83
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,859
-This is a painting. -What?

84
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,759
Peculiar, isn't it?

85
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,459
It's Mr. Katayose's hobby.

86
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,359
They say it's called "trick art".

87
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,559
Trick?

88
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,159
A maple forest growing inside the house?

89
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,459
Not quite.

90
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,659
While the trees immediately in front of us are real,

91
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,759
those in the back are paintings.

92
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,059
What?

93
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:25,059
Now that you mentioned it.

94
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:27,259
Pretty meticulous, I see!

95
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,659
Huh? Where'd they go?

96
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,259
Anyway, let's go on ahead.

97
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,559
Don't tell me that this door's also a painting?

98
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,859
Come on.

99
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,559
Maybe you need to push it?

100
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,059
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,059
Come on.

102
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:50,659
Trick art again?

103
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,459
Maybe it's a sliding door that opens sideways?

104
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,759
It opened.

105
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,959
Is Mr. Katayose's room over there?

106
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,759
Seems so.

107
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,459
This garden must be real, right?

108
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,859
Yeah.

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,559
Welcome.

110
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,159
Please help yourselves in.

111
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:40,959
Welcome!

112
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,859
I've been waiting for you, Conan.

113
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:46,059
Huh? Where's Mr. Katayose?

114
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,259
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

115
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,359
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -Please have a seat.

116
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,859
I am Ozaburo Katayose.

117
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,659
Wow! How should I put it?

118
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,259
Such extravagance.

119
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,159
No, I mean, a fine hobby.

120
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,359
Grandpa's "extravagances" are all fake!

121
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,259
You can say so because you lived along with real nature, Kaede.

122
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,159
I envy you.

123
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,159
Due to circumstances,

124
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,359
I adopted this child who lost her parents.

125
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,559
To tell the truth, I regret it.

126
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:31,359
Master Katayose.

127
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,459
I heard you were in danger again today.

128
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,759
I'm truly sorry about that.

129
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,659
No, you don't need to apologize.

130
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:43,459
It's what I'm the one who sowed the seed.

131
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,459
I've provoked those not so good children.

132
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,759
That was some vapid talk from me.

133
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,359
Here, please try it.

134
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,359
That milk was delivered straight from

135
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,559
the ranch in Kaede's hometown.

136
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,459
Any spoons, or...

137
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,059
My apologies, but I don't use spoons.

138
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:13,359
Enjoying the milk patterns drifting about in the cup

139
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,059
is my joie de vivre.

140
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,059
Call him stubborn.

141
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,159
He will never even consider putting sugar in.

142
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,359
Please help yourselves to these.

143
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,259
Detective Mouri,

144
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,159
I reckon you'd prefer sake instead?

145
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,959
Well, well...

146
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,659
In fact, I have matters I really need to consult with you.

147
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,659
But unfortunately, I already have a meeting set at 3:00.

148
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,159
After that's over,

149
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,559
how about we talk over a few cups of sake?

150
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,959
It would be my honor to join you.

151
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,659
Too sweet!

152
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,959
Please show him to the guest room.

153
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,459
Understood.

154
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,559
See, these are genuine!

155
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,059
What a superb garden!

156
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,059
They don't call this place "Red Leaf Palace" for nothing!

157
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,959
I'll clean up.

158
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,359
I'm fine. I'm fine.

159
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:17,059
It's a good distraction for me to move about.

160
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,959
After all, my body won't last much longer.

161
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,959
He's got cancer and doesn't have much longer to live.

162
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,059
He's prepared for it.

163
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,659
Mr. Katayose, I mean.

164
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,459
Is that so?

165
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,759
-Over here! -Wait up!

166
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,259
-Huh? -What's wrong?

167
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,559
I thought the mountains were still a bit away,

168
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,259
but it's actually this close?

169
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:45,359
Grandpa's pretty proud of that.

170
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:48,859
He said he tried to mimic the Hachiman shrine in Kamakura.

171
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,359
Oh, the raised pathway (dankazura).

172
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,059
By using the forced perspective effect,

173
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,659
the pathway will appear to be much longer.

174
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,859
Conan, look at that!

175
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,859
It's my tree house.

176
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,959
Grandpa made me that.

177
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,259
Kaede, you're just like a boy.

178
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,359
You got it! See?

179
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,859
All right.

180
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,759
Conan, climb up too.

181
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,559
All right.

182
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,859
This was cut by a knife.

183
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:28,759
So it is true that Kaede's life's in danger.

184
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,359
Then, does that mean

185
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,959
you're not related to the Katayose family at all?

186
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,659
That's right.

187
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,359
Grandpa said my grandma was his best friend.

188
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,759
I don't remember anything about grandma, though.

189
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,059
Then, why were you adopted?

190
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,459
I don't know.

191
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:51,559
Grandpa can be forceful sometimes.

192
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,959
He adopted me despite my uncle at the ranch

193
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,359
agreeing to take care of me himself.

194
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,359
I want to go back.

195
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,059
-Conan! Come, show me how to play soccer! -What?

196
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,059
You whipped a soccer ball up like magic earlier, didn't you?

197
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,959
I'm surprised you noticed at a time like that!

198
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,359
But that ball will go completely flat within ten seconds.

199
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,659
I also have a ball in my house!

200
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,259
I'll be the goalkeeper!

201
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:26,159
You might fall into the pond if you stand there.

202
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,559
I won't drop it!

203
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,859
I don't mean the ball, I mean you.

204
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,659
I won't fall either!

205
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,559
She's a handful.

206
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,759
Kick it stronger.

207
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,259
Got it.

208
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,859
Give it all you got! You're a boy, aren't you?

209
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,559
All right!

210
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,059
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,059
I'm sorry, grandpa!

212
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,859
He's with a guest, right?

213
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:00,259
Seems so since it's after 3:00.

214
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,259
-What's wrong? -I heard a growl.

215
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,259
I'm coming in.

216
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,659
Grandpa!

217
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,959
Steam is still coming from the cup.

218
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,559
-The culprit's still around here! -What?

219
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,059
Ran!

220
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,859
Did someone come out from the annex?

221
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:33,059
Someone? No, nobody came out.

222
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,259
Where's Pops?

223
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,259
He's sleeping in the guest room.

224
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,659
What happened?

225
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,859
Hurry up and call him.

226
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,959
This is...

227
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,759
-He's dead. -What?

228
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,359
Grandpa!

229
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,459
Someone should've been here, right?

230
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,459
Yeah. Look, the cup is still steaming.

231
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,359
Looks like his death was the result of cyanide poisoning.

232
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,759
What's all this racket about?

233
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,759
Pops!

234
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,259
What's wrong with father?

235
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,259
Master!

236
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,259
Please refrain from contaminating the scene!

237
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,759
Is this... this a murder case?

238
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,859
Nobue, was it you?

239
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:33,759
What the... Was it you?

240
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,659
You finally freaking did it!

241
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:39,259
Cut the nonsense! I merely waited in my room!

242
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,859
You were the one he called out first, no?

243
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:45,059
-The culprit is this man! -She was the one who did it!

244
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,859
Grandpa is dead.

245
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,259
Kaede.

246
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:59,069
Where were you at the time of the incident?

247
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,569
I was in the garage cleaning the cars.

248
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,969
Is there anyone who can verify that?

249
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,769
No, because I was all by myself.

250
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,469
The guest who was meeting with Mr. Katayose from 3:00...

251
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,769
You have no idea who it was?

252
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,469
That is correct.

253
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,269
Since the conversation seemed to be quite a private one,

254
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,769
I didn't dare inquire further.

255
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,369
Does that mean the guest was either Ogito or Nobue?

256
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:30,069
Or it could have been both of them.

257
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:33,469
Have you any idea what kind of conversation it was?

258
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:37,469
Well, it would likely reveal Mr. Katayose's embarrassment.

259
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,669
Hello?

260
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,069
Yes, I'll definitely pay you next month.

261
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,569
What? You can't wait that long?

262
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,069
But...

263
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,869
Understood. I'll figure out a way.

264
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:14,169
Darn it!

265
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,669
It'll be too late if I have to wait for my share of the inheritance!

266
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,869
What should I do?

267
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,069
Mirror, mirror, tell me now.

268
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,969
Which dress should I wear to the funeral?

269
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:29,769
No way.

270
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:32,469
I can't declare bankruptcy now!

271
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,469
At least give me one more month.

272
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:38,169
Those two, immoral people...

273
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,469
They went after nothing else but Mr. Katayose's fortune.

274
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:44,269
Mr. Katayose, who had prepared for his death

275
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:47,669
would have had to talk to those two in due course.

276
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:51,669
However, we have no idea which of them was called first.

277
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,769
Inspector, that was forensics.

278
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,169
The milk in the pitcher tested positive for poison.

279
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,569
It's a simple case then!

280
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,369
The son and the daughter must have known well

281
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:07,769
about Mr. Ouzaburo's affinity to milk tea.

282
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:08,869
He or she took the chance

283
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:12,269
and mixed poison into the pitcher.

284
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,169
The only question is which of them did it?

285
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,569
But Pops, how did the culprit escape?

286
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:20,669
Huh?

287
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,969
What're you talking about?

288
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,969
Yeah. I had been standing in the corridor

289
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,169
for twenty minutes prior to the incident,

290
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:29,769
but no one came out from the annex.

291
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,869
Kaede and I were in the garden

292
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,769
and were watching the annex the entire time,

293
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,369
but no one stepped out!

294
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,669
In that case, the culprit had no place to escape.

295
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,569
So, was it a sealed room murder?

296
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,269
They must have concealed themselves

297
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,169
in Mr. Ouzaburo's hidden room.

298
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,469
It's behind that painting of the cottage door on that wall.

299
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:54,169
And when Conan ran away from the scene,

300
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,569
they secretly came out and fled, no doubt.

301
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,769
Kaede was still in annex though.

302
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,669
She was stunned by her grandpa's death and lost her composure,

303
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,469
so she didn't notice.

304
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:10,869
But, doesn't that door make a loud creaking sound when opened?

305
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:14,669
If a loud noise like that had sounded,

306
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,869
I bet even we could have heard it in the corridor!

307
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,769
That's because...

308
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,569
But then, where on earth did the culprit vanish to?

309
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,569
Miss, what's wrong?

310
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,669
Nothing.

311
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,569
Just thinking that Kaede is probably awake by now.

312
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,169
She was exhausted and cried herself to sleep.

313
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:44,469
There isn't a place in this house that's free from care.

314
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,969
Feel free to go check on her.

315
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,969
What shall I do?

316
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,769
Miss!

317
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,169
Let me go check on Kaede with you.

318
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,969
That's... What room is the key for?

319
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,569
Guess I really need to report this to the Inspector.

320
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:12,069
So he really did have hidden assets!

321
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,769
Why didn't you turn the key in to me instead of the cops?

322
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,069
This is private information among the Katayose family!

323
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,769
Only after we deem it irrelevant to the case,

324
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,869
will we abide to his will.

325
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,569
However, Mr. Katayose secretly entrusted Miss Suzaka

326
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,469
with that key, you know?

327
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:36,769
He said he would like me to hold on to this indefinitely if possible.

328
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,169
Now that Pops is dead, the entire house will become mine.

329
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:42,869
-I'm still here! -Shut up!

330
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,069
Hey! Open it up already!

331
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,769
Yes.

332
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,269
-There's something! -Bet it's a check!

333
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,469
So Pops planned to give it to this woman.

334
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:56,969
That's not true.

335
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,769
-I'll take a look! -I will.

336
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:07,269
-Hey, brat. -Hand it to me.

337
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:10,169
What? Something weird's written on it!

338
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,269
What?

339
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,869
Let's see...

340
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,469
Now, close the umbrella.

341
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:18,569
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

342
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,869
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

343
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,269
Search for a longer rod.

344
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:28,269
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

345
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:29,969
What's that?

346
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,169
A code?

347
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,469
Could it be the location of the hidden assets?

348
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,869
The code...

349
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:48,369
Does it really lead to the location of a hidden fortune?

350
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:51,169
If so, why did he entrust Miss Suzaka with it?

351
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,569
And the culprit who murdered Mr. Ouzaburo?

352
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:57,769
What is the mystery behind the sealed room?

353
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:23,469
I need inheritance money instantly!

354
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,269
If only I could crack the code!

355
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,569
Wait!

356
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,769
The meaning of that...

357
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,469
I see.

358
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,869
That was scary.

359
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:42,869
But it looks like that guy figured something out.

360
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:46,669
That's it. I'll just wait for Ogito to solve the code.

361
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:49,869
I'll simply take everything away afterwards.

362
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,269
"Next Episode" -We have to protect Kaede first,

363
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,369
and then solve the mystery.

364
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,869
That's the east end of our premises

365
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:04,869
Something's glowing.

366
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,469
Let's hurry!

367
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:09,969
Darn it! Another victim?

368
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:13,669
Inspector, all the mysteries have thawed out!

369
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:14,869
What?

370
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:17,969
The culprit is you!

371
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,569
Next Conan,
