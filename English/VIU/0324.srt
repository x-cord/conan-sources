1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:04,612
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,912
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,812
There is a clockwork of complex codes in numbers.

4
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:10,912
But he finds the solution and reveals the culprit.

5
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:12,612
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,612
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,713
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,239
We were supposed to meet up with Heiji and Kazuha,

9
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,839
but they did not come.

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
So, we decided to go look for them.

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,139
We called on Mr. Kusukawa, the detective,

12
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,739
and found out they went

13
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,140
to a certain Itou residence on Kenbashi street.

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,139
You must be hungry.

15
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,139
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,940
Your mom is busy right now.

17
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,639
After I finish my work,

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,940
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,939
Good kitty.

20
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,339
Mommy has to go up to them

21
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,339
and let them know where they stand.

22
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,740
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,640
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 2)"

24
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,339
Darn it! Where are those Osaka kids?

25
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,839
I'm completely tired out.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,339
Cheer up, Dad.

27
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,339
Let's have lunch and then start searching for the Itou's again.

28
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,140
We could have passed them on the way.

29
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,439
And why must I have lunch this late in this shabby restaurant?

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,239
It's no use complaining now, Dad.

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,039
We were supposed to have lunch with them.

32
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,639
Besides, it's kind of old fashioned.

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
And I kind of like this house.

34
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,339
Old fashioned it is.

35
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,540
You don't see a horoscope dispenser so often anymore these days.

36
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,539
Hey. Make another phone call, Ran.

37
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,439
They may have gone to my detective agency.

38
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,739
Yes, Dad.

39
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,839
I've tried calling from time to time.

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,540
But I the phone won't connect.

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,039
-Hello? -It's me.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,839
Hattori?

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,339
What?

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,839
Give me the phone!

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,439
Hey, you guys! Where on earth are you?

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,639
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,339
I'm with Mr. Kusukawa in a coffee shop.

48
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,039
We've been talking about detective business

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,039
and forgot to get in touch with you.

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,139
Then, is Kazuha there with you, too?

51
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,339
Don't worry about her.

52
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,239
She is alright.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,939
By the way, Pops,

54
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,539
we have a cipher that we want you to solve it.

55
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,039
A cipher?

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,839
and I promised him that I won't go back until I solve it.

58
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,039
I tried everything, but I couldn't solve it.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,739
So, I thought of getting your help while Mr. Kusukawa is out.

60
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,739
Huh? Aren't Mr. Kusukawa there with you?

61
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,039
No. One of his mahjong pals called him on the phone.

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,339
They need one more player.

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,040
He went outside to tell them he can't make it.

64
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,939
Well, I will mail the cipher through the phone right now.

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,939
You send me the solution by sundown.

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,039
Let me know the seven numerals hidden in that cipher.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,839
Seven numerals?

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,739
If you can't solve it, I can't come to you.

69
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,139
So, hang in there.

70
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,039
Hey, wait!

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Darn it.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,739
What a smart kid you are to let Kogoro Mouri think it over for you.

73
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,340
Thanks.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,439
Now, we need to mail the cipher.

75
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,639
He soiled the paper with his blood,

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,439
so we can't read the lower half of it.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,039
What?

78
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,339
Didn't you make a copy of it?

79
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,339
No. After we got that cipher,

80
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,840
we were busy interrogating Kusukawa.

81
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,139
I have memorized all of it.

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,740
49 numerals and the order of the alphabets.

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,739
Really? Then, tell me

84
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,539
all the 49 letters without looking at the paper.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,539
But if you give me even one wrong number,

86
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,740
you will get stained with the blood of that girlfriend of yours.

87
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,939
What's this?

88
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,039
I can't make any sense out of this.

89
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,439
True.

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,139
Numerals and four alphabets.

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,740
Q, A, K, J.

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,739
Could it be...

93
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,439
I have no idea what they are supposed to mean.

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,339
But Heiji said he won't budge an inch until he solves this.

95
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,539
I'm busy!

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,239
Huh? Conan, did you find out something?

97
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,339
Yes. A little.

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
What's that?

99
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,339
Look at these letters.

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,539
The A, J, Q, and K remind me of the letters on playing cards.

101
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,939
So, I've changed them into numbers.

102
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,239
And then?

103
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,739
Then, the numbers turned out to be 64 in all.

104
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,940
But I noticed that there is one lone number.

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,739
That's the nine in the center.

106
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,639
There's only one nine.

107
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,939
Yes. Take that 9 out,

108
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,439
and the remaining 63 numerals will make 7 groups of 9 numerals.

109
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,939
If there are seven numerals in this cipher,

110
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,839
each of the seven groups should be a certain number.

111
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,939
But you can't solve it like math.

112
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,440
I see.

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,139
It's just a bunch of nonsense.

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,340
Here's your diced steaks, sir.

115
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,839
This is just the thing I've been waiting for.

116
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,640
Hi. This is the Kid's Lunch Plate.

117
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,239
Hey, Pops. Can it be Mr. Kusukawa who coded this cipher?

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,839
Yes.

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,239
I see. That's why the center is a nine.

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
Here is your omelette, Miss.

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,539
It looks delicious.

122
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,039
Conan?

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,539
It's rather simple once you figure out how to solve it.

124
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,539
Huh? This looks strange.

125
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,340
The first four are numerals, but the last three are not.

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,740
Wait. I saw these somewhere before.

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,840
Now, the time is up.

128
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,139
We have to go now, otherwise we won't make it in time

129
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,639
to use the safe deposit box.

130
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,739
If you want to blame someone,

131
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,739
blame it on that incompetent detective of yours.

132
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,139
Wait! I may be able to solve it overnight.

133
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,439
You can go to the bank tomorrow

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,239
before the letter is delivered to the detective agency.

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,339
We are not worried about it.

136
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,939
Because the letter will not be delivered.

137
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,639
What? You are not going to...

138
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Yes, we are.

139
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:29,139
We'll ambush the deliveryman in front of the office

140
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,539
and rob him of the letter.

141
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,039
We will keep paying the fee for using the safe,

142
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,340
and the tape will not come out into this world.

143
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,739
We will take time to solve the cipher.

144
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,039
Unlike you guys, I have unlimited time on my side.

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,339
Now, if you have anything left to say,

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,239
I'll listen to you.

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,239
To listen to a person with genuine concern

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,639
is a duty for an attorney.

149
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,039
Darn it. Kudo, you fool.

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,740
What are you doing?

151
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,239
You don't seem to have any concern for this world.

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,739
Well then, as you wish...

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,139
I do... I have a lot.

154
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,339
I have so many things to say that I was at a loss.

155
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,739
More than anything else,

156
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,840
I want to say a word to the girl behind me.

157
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,139
What do you want to say to her?

158
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,739
You know she will be dead soon, don't you?

159
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,039
I wanted to tell her some important things since a long time ago.

160
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,539
So, would you mind putting your gun on the floor

161
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,139
while I talk to her?

162
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,539
Well, well. After all, you guys are high school kids.

163
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,740
Excuse me for being dense.

164
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,340
This will do, I hope.

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,739
Now, you can start telling her.

166
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,539
Gosh. Don't rush me.

167
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,240
I am choosing the best words for her.

168
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,839
So that she'll be impressed and can go to heaven with those words.

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
They must be fascinating and wonderful words.

170
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,539
He's still alive.

171
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,840
Darn it!

172
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,639
It's a pity, Heiji.

173
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,939
It was such a good strategy for taking the gun from me.

174
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,939
Strategy, was it?

175
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,240
Now, get up.

176
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,340
But we are lucky to find him alive.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,839
Now, let's have it. Give me the answer to the cipher.

178
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,440
Or do you want to see the head of your kid friend here blown apart?

179
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,139
Don't tell her, Mr. Kusukawa.

180
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,239
If you do,

181
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,639
it'll only buy you a little more time to go to heaven.

182
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,940
So, let's make them regret what they're doing.

183
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,839
You talk too much!

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,040
Heiji!

185
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,739
Now, hurry up!

186
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,339
Give me the answer before I count up to five.

187
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,139
We are running out of time,

188
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,939
so I won't hesitate to fire at the first person.

189
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,039
Stop it, please!

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,839
One.

191
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,739
I really mean it, Kazuha.

192
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,839
-Two. -I really wanted to tell you something...

193
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,339
before I die.

194
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,639
Three.

195
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,739
I've tried to tell so you many times.

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,539
Four.

197
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,939
When we were back to back and I felt you trembling.

198
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,739
I wanted to say...

199
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,640
Five.

200
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,138
Oh, my. A mail.

201
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:52,137
From Kogoro Mouri?

202
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,537
They couldn't possibly have solved the cipher so soon!

203
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:57,237
It doesn't look like an answer to me.

204
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:02,337
Didn't they just send back what we sent them?

205
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,437
No.

206
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:07,037
Some of the numerals and alphabets are in different order.

207
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:10,238
What? Hey, give me the phone.

208
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,838
No... Could I take a look at it, please?

209
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,037
There, take a look.

210
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,038
It looks exactly like the cipher I gave you to solve.

211
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,137
Yes, this one looks very much like it.

212
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,038
But this is an answer to the mail we sent.

213
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:34,737
This says they found the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

214
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,937
You are not making it up, are you?

215
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,837
Then, tell us.

216
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,037
I can't tell you here.

217
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:44,837
Little one. You don't know what a sorry pickle you're in, do you?

218
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,737
You're the one who don't know what pickle you're in.

219
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,337
Huh?

220
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:52,737
Kogoro Mouri knows the answer to the cipher.

221
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,937
Furthermore, he knows that Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

222
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:59,837
and also that we are with Mr. Kusukawa.

223
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:02,537
If the three of us disappeared at the same time,

224
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:05,537
that will make the detective think hard,

225
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:06,737
and he'll find out

226
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:09,037
the meaning of the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

227
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:14,037
And that the seven digit number is an ID.

228
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,037
Well, he will take less than a week to find them all.

229
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,537
Don't tell me that you sent your cipher to Kogoro Mouri

230
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:21,437
knowing what he will do all the while?

231
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:23,437
We'll be in big trouble, Miss.

232
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,337
We can kill them and run, can't we?

233
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,337
You talk too much.

234
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,137
You have only two choices.

235
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,737
You kill us,

236
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:36,037
let Kogoro Mouri get the tape and listen to it

237
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,837
or let me go get the tape,

238
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:43,537
and exchange us for the tape.

239
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,637
Actually, Mr. Kusukawa can go instead of me.

240
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:49,638
But he can't possibly play the role with that swollen face of his.

241
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:54,337
So, I'm telling you I will go instead of him for you.

242
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,937
And as Mr. Kusukawa told you,

243
00:13:56,938 --> 00:14:02,037
if you stop doing bad things and promise not to kill us,

244
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:04,638
I won't turn you in to the police, so don't worry.

245
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,237
You can't fool me.

246
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:10,837
You're going to get the tape and rush it to the police.

247
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:14,837
Then, one of you can come with me

248
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:17,837
and watch over me to keep me from doing anything funny.

249
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,637
You don't have much time to think.

250
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:21,837
If we don't get going now,

251
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:25,438
we won't make it in time to use the safe deposit.

252
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:29,637
I see.

253
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:32,837
Okay, I will accept your terms.

254
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,837
But if the answer to the cipher proves wrong,

255
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:38,538
you know what will become of you.

256
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:49,437
Now, Heiji can go with me,

257
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:54,037
and the young lady can stay here with him.

258
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,037
Heiji.

259
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,937
What is it, Kazuha?

260
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,538
If we make it through...

261
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:04,037
If we make it through,

262
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:07,038
will you tell me what you were going to tell me?

263
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:12,437
Sure.

264
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,438
I'll keep on telling you until you get tired of hearing it.

265
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:26,438
Heiji.

266
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:34,837
It's gasoline.

267
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:37,437
As soon as we get a phone call from her saying that she's got the tape,

268
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,937
we'll set fire.

269
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,037
That kid will be surprised to learn

270
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:44,937
that you are not in front of the house waiting for him,

271
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:50,138
but are inside the house and that it's on fire.

272
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,338
"Tohto Bank"

273
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,837
All right, Heiji.

274
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:58,237
Be quick about it.

275
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:02,537
Enter the seven numbers hidden in the cipher.

276
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:06,937
Well, don't you want to know how to solve the cipher?

277
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:09,337
No, that can wait.

278
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:13,237
Since that cipher was made by Mr. Kusukawa, the gambling man,

279
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,738
you can easily see that those A, J, Q, and K are of playing cards.

280
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,937
Change them into numbers,

281
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,137
and we have 64 numerals in all.

282
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,237
But there's something bothers me

283
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:27,937
which is number nine in the center.

284
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:32,438
There are lots of 1 to 6 numbers, but there's only one 9.

285
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,737
That's when it hit me that if I take out the 9,

286
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:38,737
I can divide the remaining 63 numerals by 9

287
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:40,437
and get 7 groups of numbers.

288
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:46,937
Those 7 groups of numbers can stand for a 7-digit number.

289
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:50,837
And all numbers are in 1 to 6.

290
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:52,937
For a gambling man,

291
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:55,837
1 to 6 means only one thing, doesn't it?

292
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,637
A dice.

293
00:16:57,638 --> 00:17:00,337
The code is telling you to put the 9 numerals of 7 groups

294
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:05,238
into the form of dice of 3 by 3 squares.

295
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:11,537
But what and where are the seven numerals?

296
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,537
Okay. Let's change the numbers into the dots of dice,

297
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,037
and imagine we are looking at the dice.

298
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,437
The red dots of dice are bigger and striking,

299
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,137
now you can read the seven numbers.

300
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:25,437
The number comes up to 3156204.

301
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:30,938
So, it's 3156204.

302
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:34,137
Probably, the cipher was made into squares

303
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,337
with the center to be nine

304
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:40,337
because of the image of dice and dots on them.

305
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:42,538
Look! It's opened.

306
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,238
So, this is it. The tape you wanted to get.

307
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:51,037
Looks like it. Now, give it to me quickly.

308
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,837
Before doing so, you will learn another interesting tale.

309
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:55,937
What?

310
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:59,937
The lower half of the cipher I sent to Kogoro is slightly changed.

311
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:04,738
The lower three numerals were changed to stand for alphabets.

312
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,038
Alphabets?

313
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,437
Right.

314
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:11,537
One capital and two small case letters.

315
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,337
L, I, B.

316
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,737
Libra, the Balance.

317
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:19,837
A Latin for the balance scale shortened to L-I-B.

318
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,337
Libra?

319
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:23,237
You don't know?

320
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:25,338
You wear it on your lapel, don't you?

321
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,038
The attorney's pin in the form of the balance.

322
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:36,137
Then, Kogoro Mouri might go to my house to...

323
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:38,037
He probably went and did it

324
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,337
because he sent me back that mail of his.

325
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,737
A mail?

326
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:44,637
Get them out.

327
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,037
Take them outside the house

328
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,038
to reduce the number of bad guys.

329
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,837
I can't believe it.

330
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,337
You'd better believe it.

331
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,938
Because you have no hands in this game.

332
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,137
Hey, are you there?

333
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,337
You're up there, aren't you?

334
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:07,037
Don't be so slow. Come on down, guys!

335
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,038
Miss, is that you?

336
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,137
So quick, isn't it?

337
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,838
Did you forget something?

338
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:18,837
Hey!

339
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,037
What's wrong?

340
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,238
Hey!

341
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,838
Isn't that a soccer ball?

342
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,038
Who is it?

343
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,637
I don't really get it,

344
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,737
but I called the police already.

345
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:46,538
And I just hope I did something right for them.

346
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,737
The police arrived in time

347
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:54,937
to securely protect Kazuha and Mr. Kusukawa.

348
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:59,337
The dishonest attorney and her two men were arrested.

349
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,037
And the case of the cipher, illegal tax evasion, and confinement

350
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,438
was solved and closed in an instant.

351
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:41,637
So, you used that voice changer to mimic her voice

352
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,337
and lured them to come out.

353
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:47,037
Then, you used anesthetic gun and a soccer ball to knock them down.

354
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,537
That was great, Kudo.

355
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,537
You better thank me for it.

356
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,237
I had to come out of the toilet of a restaurant to go up to you.

357
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:57,737
If you didn't leave like you did back then,

358
00:21:57,738 --> 00:22:00,837
things wouldn't have gotten as complicated as this.

359
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:05,438
I have no idea that'd you'd be held up by a middle-aged lady like her.

360
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,937
Conan, are you alright?

361
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:12,937
Your kid's lunch has gotten cold.

362
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:15,038
I'll be with you in a minute.

363
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:18,437
A kid's lunch for you?

364
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,637
Ran sometimes orders it for a nice kid like me.

365
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:26,337
Well, it served as a hint for solving the cipher.

366
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:31,137
Yes. The red circle on the flag and the one on the die is the same.

367
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,937
By the way, why did Mr. Kusukawa

368
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,537
go to her and talk her out of her wrongdoings

369
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,837
despite knowing that he'd be great bait for the mass media?

370
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:42,838
Long time ago, Mr. Kusukawa's mom got help from that attorney.

371
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:45,237
His mother suffered great losses in a fraud

372
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,437
and that attorney helped her at that time.

373
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:50,738
So, his mother is very grateful.

374
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,237
Because of this memory,

375
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,538
he went to her to talk her out of doing illegal business.

376
00:22:57,338 --> 00:23:00,637
I'm really grateful to you.

377
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:02,937
I was really in deep water when you came to me.

378
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:05,037
What deep water are you talking about?

379
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,237
You mean the time when you really wanted to tell me something?

380
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,337
Kazuha.

381
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,837
What was it?

382
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:13,437
What did you want to tell me

383
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,837
when you felt me trembling against your back?

384
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:18,737
You better not hear it.

385
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:21,637
You told me you'd tell until I get tired of hearing it.

386
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:24,537
What on earth was it?

387
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:26,938
Well...

388
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,537
Well?

389
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,738
Well?

390
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,137
It's about...

391
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:37,137
Every time you trembled behind me...

392
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,737
your hair...

393
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:43,937
Your hair like a horse tail pricked me on my neck

394
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,938
and made me so ticklish.

395
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,437
I'm really sorry for you.

396
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:55,038
Drop dead for once!

397
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,337
"Next Episode" -An arsonist?

398
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,637
From the start of this year,

399
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:06,437
there have been a series of arson cases.

400
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:10,037
But there's always this one thing left at the site of the fire.

401
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,338
A red horse doll.

402
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:16,337
But I know of a house that may be a target.

403
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,338
What?

404
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,037
Well, I don't really have anywhere to go this holiday,

405
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,938
so I will go visit that house.

406
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:30,038
