1
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:06,833
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,733
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:10,433
Dr. Agasa's weird code

4
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:11,933
is tough for the Youth Detective Squad.

5
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,933
Who's going to be the first to solve it?

6
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,333
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,033
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,434
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,232
One hot summer day,

10
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,132
we came to collect insects.

11
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,932
Doc gave us a code quiz "pill bug and a tent",

12
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,432
which would lead us to where the treasure is hidden.

13
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,633
But I couldn't solve the code either.

14
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,032
Meanwhile, I get a call from Ran and Sonoko who are at the beach

15
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,833
saying that there was a murder at the hotel that they're staying at.

16
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:24,932
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

17
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:28,732
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

18
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,733
What kind of writing?

19
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,632
Something like a code.

20
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,432
And who found the body?

21
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,933
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

22
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,432
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

23
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,032
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

24
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:51,032
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

25
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:54,032
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

26
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,233
This is what they testified to the police.

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,733
Then we...

28
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:04,932
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

29
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:09,432
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

30
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,532
That's where...

31
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,933
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

32
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,032
"Pill bug and tent..."

33
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,533
Does that mean to light it up?

34
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:29,333
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 2)"

35
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,932
Huh?

36
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,032
There are a lot of people.

37
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,732
There must be some kind of a gathering, don't you think?

38
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,532
Stupid! Take a closer look.

39
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,932
Everyone is holding a basin.

40
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,032
It's true!

41
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,932
The villagers probably bought the closed down inn

42
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,532
and are using it as a public bath.

43
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,232
I see.

44
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:58,932
Sento (Public bath)?

45
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:03,232
Maybe this "tento" (tent) means "sento" (public bath).

46
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,932
No matter how you look at it, Genta,

47
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:08,232
this "te" doesn't look like "se".

48
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,432
And it can't be "tentou"

49
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,932
because there's no "u" after the "tento".

50
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,032
"U"?

51
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,732
Darn it!

52
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,332
I don't get it!

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,232
Genta, don't lie down in despair.

54
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,232
I'm not in despair.

55
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:29,732
Doc told us to lie down and think it through,

56
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,832
and I just might get it.

57
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,332
But...

58
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,932
Ai was saying that if we still don't get it,

59
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,732
we should wash our faces and start anew.

60
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,332
Since there's a public bath,

61
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,332
why don't we go and wash our faces and our bodies?

62
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,733
That's a great idea!

63
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,932
It's no use.

64
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,132
Ai.

65
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,632
It's no use going to that inn. There's nothing there.

66
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,732
You guys have to try and think a little bit more.

67
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,632
Then tell us!

68
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,732
Where is the treasure?

69
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,732
Please tell us.

70
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,132
Sure, I can tell you.

71
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,933
Only if someone here gives up.

72
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,133
I'm not giving up!

73
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,533
A mail.

74
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,232
It's from Sonoko.

75
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,332
Huh?

76
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,633
I thought her cell phone was in the bag that was stolen.

77
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,932
I found this bag on the street

78
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,732
and since there was no ID,

79
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,432
I mailed the most recent person

80
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:40,432
the cell phone listed to have sent a mail to.

81
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,332
I want to send this bag to you,

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,732
so can you please give me your address and name?

83
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,132
It seems like the purse-snatcher just took the purse

84
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,833
and threw the bag away.

85
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:57,832
Wouldn't you usually ask for the address and name of the owner of the bag?

86
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,332
Why did this person send a mail?

87
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,532
Wouldn't it be quicker to look at the record of calls made

88
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,732
and call someone from that list?

89
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,632
Huh?

90
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,633
You give up, right?

91
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,733
Time out!

92
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,533
Take the bag to the police if you found it.

93
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,332
Hello, Ran?

94
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,932
I just got mail from the person who found Sonoko's bag.

95
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,932
Oh, really?

96
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,532
You'll probably receive a mail, too.

97
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,232
-So you can do something about it. -I'm sorry.

98
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,233
What's up?

99
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,532
My cell phone's battery is low.

100
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,832
I'm at the police station right now.

101
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,232
I'll get back to you when I return to the hotel.

102
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,532
Then did you tell them that the letters might mean "tel shite"?

103
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:51,032
The police and Mr. Miyama's three friends are saying that it makes sense.

104
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,732
But that doesn't help to specify the killer,

105
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,532
so we're going back to the hotel for now.

106
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,932
Hey, be careful.

107
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,632
The purse-snatcher is probably still roaming the streets.

108
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,833
We'll be all right!

109
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,932
I just asked Mr. Kanou

110
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,932
-to take me and your wife back to the hotel! -Wife?

111
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,132
Who's Kanou?

112
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,232
Ran was just talking to you about him.

113
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,432
Mr. Miyama's good looking friend.

114
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,632
A good looking guy!

115
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,232
-Sonoko. -What's the big deal? It's true.

116
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,932
The other two friends are with him, right?

117
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,332
It seems like he's alone.

118
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,632
Mr. Miyama's girlfriend, Miss Yanuma

119
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,032
is still being questioned by the police,

120
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:38,432
so Mr. Kanou was planning to wait for her in his car until she finished.

121
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,232
But Mr. Bito seems to have returned to the hotel already.

122
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:45,932
Since Miss Yanuma's questioning is taking time,

123
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,732
Mr. Kanou will be taking us back to the hotel

124
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,432
and return again to pick her up.

125
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,832
Okay.

126
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,933
I'm hanging up now. My cell phone is really running out of battery.

127
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,132
Come on.

128
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,032
I should have gone to the beach, too.

129
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,332
Beach?

130
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,832
Talking about the beach, I found a jellyfish.

131
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,932
What are you talking about, Ayumi?

132
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:11,232
There are no jellyfish in the mountains.

133
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,633
Yes, there are.

134
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,833
See! Over there!

135
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,133
Really?

136
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,233
See. A jellyfish!

137
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,132
True.

138
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,032
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

139
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,832
-Right? -A jellyfish.

140
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,533
I can see it.

141
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:43,633
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

142
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,333
So that's it. That's what it is.

143
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,133
Lie down and wash you face.

144
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,733
How stupid of me.

145
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,432
Having trouble with a code like this.

146
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:11,433
Well, sometimes easy codes are difficult to solve.

147
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,032
Doc!

148
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,632
It's about time. Tell us the answer.

149
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,933
What is the meaning behind the code?

150
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,932
Alright.

151
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:28,932
No! I won't tell you until everyone gives up.

152
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,132
I'll give up so just tell me.

153
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,132
That's not fair, Genta.

154
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,432
Why Ran?

155
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,033
Conan!

156
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,333
Can't you solve it?

157
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,832
It's totally Greek to me, I haven't got a clue.

158
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,232
Then hurry up and give up!

159
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:51,932
Conan, just admit your defeat already!

160
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,333
You guys give up too easily.

161
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,533
It seems like Shinichi can't solve it either.

162
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,033
Anyway, let's think it over from the very beginning.

163
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,332
First, all these codes are written only in Katakana.

164
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,632
It's understandable that pill bug and tent are written in Katakana.

165
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:16,332
Don't you think its weird for the "ni" in between is in Katakana, too?

166
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,932
That's true.

167
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:23,032
Secondly, if you look closely, the letters are not balanced.

168
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,132
That's true!

169
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:27,433
Isn't that because Doc's handwriting is messy?

170
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,732
And thirdly,

171
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,133
the hint Dr and Haibara was talking about.

172
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,932
Did they give us a hint?

173
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:42,432
Yes. "Lie down and think carefully",

174
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,932
and "if you still don't get it, wash your face and start anew"

175
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,932
are things Doc and Haibara don't usually say.

176
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,632
It's obviously a hint!

177
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:54,832
Maybe it means to lie down and look at these letters.

178
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,833
Okay!

179
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,033
Lie down, right?

180
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,933
I don't see anything different.

181
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,332
What happened, Genta?

182
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,633
Did you get something?

183
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,133
What?

184
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,232
Genta, what's going on?

185
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,532
No, I thought I almost got it.

186
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,632
-Almost? -Which is it?

187
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,732
Shut up!

188
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,333
I thought I could almost read it when I lied down.

189
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,932
Close call, close call.

190
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,432
No.

191
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:39,433
That smile, that provoking annoying look.

192
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,933
He probably already knows it.

193
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,833
Nothing comes to mind even if I look at it from the side.

194
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:55,432
Then let's look at the other hint.

195
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:59,232
You mean the "go wash your face"?

196
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:04,032
But to wash your face in the middle of the woods...

197
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,332
Maybe...

198
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,232
Does it mean to go take a bath in the inn?

199
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,233
Stupid.

200
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:14,532
Didn't Haibara and Doc said there was nothing at the inn?

201
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,732
Then where do you say we should wash?

202
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:17,932
That's right!

203
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,832
I don't know. Maybe it doesn't mean to actually wash your face.

204
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,833
Maybe it has something to do with what you do when you wash your face.

205
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,332
First of all, turn the faucet on.

206
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,632
Splash water on your face.

207
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,032
Wipe your face with a towel.

208
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,732
And then, after that?

209
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,032
After that is...

210
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,233
Let's see...

211
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,932
Let's eat!

212
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,532
Hey, Genta.

213
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,532
We're talking about when we are washing our faces.

214
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,032
You eat after you wash your face, don't you?

215
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,832
Mirror!

216
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,932
After that, I look in the mirror!

217
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,232
Mirror?

218
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:56,532
You can only see your face in it.

219
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,832
I'm getting more mixed up!

220
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,632
I think the mirror is on the right track.

221
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,832
Look.

222
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,532
Turn it upside down like that hot spring mark

223
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,333
and it looks like something totally different, like the jellyfish.

224
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,132
Even if I hold it upside down,

225
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,832
it doesn't look like a porgy or a flounder.

226
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,032
I can't even read what it says.

227
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,732
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:22,932
Could it be to wash your face while lying down?

229
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,432
To look at the mirror with the letters written downwards

230
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,632
by turning it sideways?

231
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,932
Turn it sideways,

232
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,433
reverse the paper and look at it through the mirror.

233
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,433
"Mura matsuri no torii."

234
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,833
The shrine gate of the village festival...

235
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,432
It's that shrine!

236
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:59,332
Isn't that right, Doc, Ai?

237
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,832
Correct!

238
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,633
You're correct!

239
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,232
We did it...

240
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,233
-We did it! -We did it!

241
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,832
Let's hurry and go there!

242
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,133
Treasure!

243
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,432
Oh, my.

244
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:21,633
You look like you taught the kids that they can do it if they try.

245
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,633
Don't I look great?

246
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,532
Shinichi, aren't you going to go see what the treasure is?

247
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,332
I bet you want to see it, too.

248
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,832
I don't have to see it to know what it is.

249
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,332
The place of the code

250
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:42,033
is the torii gate of the shrine that's lit up even late at night.

251
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,633
If we put sap on the pole of the torii gate...

252
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,832
I'll bet a lot will come.

253
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,033
I found it!

254
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,432
Amazing!

255
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,633
Unicorn beetles and stag beetles.

256
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,833
That's right!

257
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,233
Anyway...

258
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,132
you did a great job with the code.

259
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,632
This can be read from the front and back.

260
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,332
Thanks to Ai.

261
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,332
First, we were going to make it an animal code.

262
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:28,832
We thought of sticking paper with animal names on the window!

263
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,032
Watching that from the outside, Ai told me...

264
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,832
Isn't "sanso" (oxygen) a little bit hard for the kids?

265
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,332
Like that.

266
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:43,132
I see. The letters "kirin" (giraffe) looked like "sanso"

267
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,333
from the back and you thought of the code.

268
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,733
Shinichi?

269
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,432
Glass?

270
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,332
Back?

271
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,332
See through...

272
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,032
Wait a minute.

273
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,833
This is...

274
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,532
Darn it! That's it!

275
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,532
-Shinichi? -Kudo?

276
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,032
So that was it!

277
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,932
That's why Ran's face crossed my mind.

278
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:14,233
Ran's in danger!

279
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,248
Shinichi?

280
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,748
Where am I?

281
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,248
Didn't I told you earlier?

282
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:32,948
We're returning to the hotel in Mr. Kanou's car.

283
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,748
What? Get out of the car now?

284
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:38,749
I got what "t, e, i, u" really means!

285
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:45,848
There was a little punctuation before the "t" in "t, e, i, u"!

286
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,648
Put that vertical and reverse it!

287
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,349
It's the killer's name.

288
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,548
Hey, Ran?

289
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,549
Ran! Ran!

290
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,448
The battery's dead.

291
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,048
What did your husband say?

292
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,548
Hey, Sonoko!

293
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,548
Get out of the car, make it vertical and reverse it?

294
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:07,949
What is it?

295
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,349
Maybe he's just jealous?

296
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,549
No way.

297
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:20,248
Ran and Sonoko are in trouble?

298
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,248
Yes. Sonoko saw it!

299
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:26,248
The letters written by the person murdered in the hotel room.

300
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:27,948
Letters?

301
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,948
It was in lower case alphabet written horizontally!

302
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,148
To be more accurate,

303
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,848
there's a comma before the "t" and a dot on "i" which supposed to be "l",

304
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,648
and the "u" is the "shi" in Hiragana.

305
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,348
It's the same as "mura matsuri no torii",

306
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,248
turn the horizontally written letters vertical,

307
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,748
and read it from the back.

308
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,648
It's "Maru mushi ni tento".

309
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,248
Make "sanso" vertical and read it from the back.

310
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,548
It's "kirin".

311
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,449
Then, what about "t, e, i, u"?

312
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,148
That is...

313
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,349
It becomes "Kanou".

314
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,849
Kanou.

315
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:13,248
Why did he leave such a difficult code as a dying message?

316
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:16,048
It's not a code!

317
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,548
The victim fell on the floor

318
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,348
and wrote the words on the window from the inside.

319
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:24,948
And Sonoko saw the letters from the outside.

320
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:29,148
Then we have to hurry and tell Ran.

321
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,448
Ran's phone is dead.

322
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:37,749
And the thing is, Ran and Sonoko are both in that Kanou's car!

323
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,948
Hey. This is not the way to the hotel.

324
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:53,048
Don't worry, it's a short cut.

325
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,048
Where's the hotel those two are staying at?

326
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,748
If I knew, I would call the police!

327
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,448
They told me they were going to the beach,

328
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,048
but I don't know where.

329
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,348
Darn it! I should've realized this earlier.

330
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,948
When I received the weird mail from Sonoko's cell phone

331
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,848
which was thought to be mugged!

332
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:17,648
The picture sent to my cell phone, he wanted to delete the picture

333
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,948
with the dying message.

334
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,549
That's why he asked for my address and name.

335
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,949
Wait a minute, then it must mean...

336
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,448
The guy you were talking about, Shinichi,

337
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:31,648
he's only in high school, yet he's a detective?

338
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,248
Yes, sort of.

339
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:36,148
It's great to have a detective boyfriend.

340
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,348
No, he's not my boyfriend.

341
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,648
They're so lovey-dovey.

342
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:48,048
That's why I sent her boyfriend a picture of her in her bathing suit.

343
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,449
Hey, Sonoko!

344
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,048
That's so unfortunate.

345
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,348
Shinichi is not here, right?

346
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:59,348
I would have liked to meet the detective.

347
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:03,548
-He must be devouring that photo right now. -Sonoko!

348
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,849
Nonsense!

349
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,648
If the killer is waiting for me to contact him,

350
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,648
he should be carrying Sonoko's cell phone around with it switched on.

351
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,748
Please realize it.

352
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,749
That's the man. He's the killer!

353
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,348
Huh? That tune is the same as Sonoko's.

354
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,549
Or rather, that is mine.

355
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:31,648
You're right!

356
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,849
Really? But why?

357
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,748
Of course.

358
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:40,549
I'm the one who snatched the purse from you.

359
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:46,748
To erase the evidence of the killing.

360
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,048
-What? - Huh?

361
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,348
When we go a little farther, I want you to talk to me.

362
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,449
And give me the address of the kid Shinichi, too!

363
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,448
He still won't answer?

364
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,248
Be quiet!

365
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,349
Okay.

366
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,248
He answered?

367
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:10,449
Hello? Hello?

368
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,149
Hello?

369
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,348
What do you mean hello?

370
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:44,148
Where were you when Ran needed you?

371
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:45,948
Hey, are you listening?

372
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,148
-Where... -Are you listening?

373
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,548
The car crashed into a tree, and it was so much trouble!

374
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,048
The car? Why'd it ram into a tree?

375
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,648
Don't ask me why. It just happened.

376
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:01,148
Ran side kicked the face of the killer

377
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:04,648
who was driving the car.

378
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,849
Is that right?

379
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,348
After that, the police that Sonoko called arrived

380
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,349
and the killer was taken into custody.

381
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:19,748
His motive for committing the murder was because his friend found out

382
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:21,948
about his illegal enrolment to the university and he was being blackmailed.

383
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:25,648
He committed a more serious crime to hide his first criminal act

384
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,949
which was a typical pattern for cases like these.

385
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,848
Then...

386
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,248
Huh?

387
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:35,049
I thought I saved it here.

388
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,348
If it's the picture of the lady in the bathing suit,

389
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,049
I've deleted it for you!

390
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,448
Why?

391
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:45,848
What do you mean by why? It's against the law!

392
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:49,249
Sorry. I asked Ai to delete it.

393
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,749
Haibara?

394
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:55,148
You...

395
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,149
Darn it!

396
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,848
"Next Episode" -"Detective Fluke" is interesting.

397
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,749
It's amazing how they can think up a trick like that.

398
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:10,749
That guy. He's one of the three scriptwriters, isn't he?

399
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,448
Those challenging eyes...

400
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,548
He's gotta be the suspect.

401
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:24,448
And he's confident about the trick he used.

402
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:30,449
Next Conan, "The Mystery of the Complete Half Crime".

403
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,148
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,448
"The two cups."

405
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,848
What's title of the next episode?

406
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:54,949
It's half of the complete, so if eel over rice is used as analogy.
