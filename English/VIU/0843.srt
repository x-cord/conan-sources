1
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:04,666
What?

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,267
A meal coupon?

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,666
You mean you won the lottery again?

4
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:10,966
Wow!

5
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,467
You're really lucky when it comes to lotteries, aren't you?

6
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:18,266
So, I thought I'd take you all to the high class restaurant

7
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,766
on the top floor of the Beika Department Store

8
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:23,466
to have a fancy lunch today!

9
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,266
All right!

10
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,366
There's still more!

11
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:32,166
You've still got more happy news coming, you see!

12
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,867
-What is it? -Tell us!

13
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,466
It's still a secret!

14
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:39,966
-What? -Come on.

15
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,366
Don't be a Scrooge!

16
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,666
If Sera is Akai's younger sister,

17
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:49,666
what did she come back to Japan from the States for?

18
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,766
Did she come to confirm whether Mr. Akai

19
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,066
who was said to have died was really dead?

20
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:58,066
Is that why she approached us, who had contact with the FBI?

21
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,566
If so, she'd be checking me up more closely.

22
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:07,266
So then, it has to be something to do with that intermediate school girl

23
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,166
that Sera is keeping at the hotel.

24
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,366
Her name is probably Mary.

25
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,466
The one called the younger sister from another domain,

26
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,666
who looks just like Sera.

27
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:17,866
No.

28
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,766
Rather than Sera, she...

29
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,966
What? In deep thought or something?

30
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,866
Yes, sort of.

31
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:29,666
What's with those bags under your eyes?

32
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,366
Last night, before going to sleep, I found a cockroach,

33
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:36,166
and it took me till 4:00 in the morning to get rid of it!

34
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,066
Really?

35
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,367
Doc went to sleep right away, though.

36
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,666
And? What were you thinking about?

37
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,466
Well...

38
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:52,167
I was wondering what lunch at a high class restaurant would be like.

39
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,166
Really?

40
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,767
What a carefree guy.

41
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,867
Sorry.

42
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,366
A canvas stained black with crime.

43
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,766
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

44
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,566
There are many things to think about.

45
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,266
But first, lunch, then an incident occurs!

46
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,966
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,267
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:03,326
"The Detective Squad in a Grove (Part 1)"

50
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:16,825
Fantastic!

51
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:19,525
It's full of Christmas inside the department store.

52
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,926
-Wow! -This sure is exciting!

53
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,225
Santa Claus!

54
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,925
He's passing out balloons!

55
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,725
-Let's go get some! -Yes!

56
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,325
Merry Christmas!

57
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:33,625
-Yeah! -Thank you very much!

58
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,925
Hey, the elevator's that way!

59
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:41,326
I know it's almost Christmas, but talk about crowded...

60
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,125
Ai. Look, look!

61
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,225
They're putting on make-up over there!

62
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:52,125
Yeah. A demonstration sales of cosmetics.

63
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,125
My, this mascara is good!

64
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:58,225
Just the thing for your Christmas date!

65
00:04:58,226 --> 00:04:59,525
You can say that again!

66
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,325
-Mascara... -How nice.

67
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:05,225
Hey, Doc's calling you.

68
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:08,226
You guys are too young for stuff like that!

69
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,525
What? You can't do it?

70
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:16,925
Then, what's this? Are you saying that we're not customers?

71
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:19,425
So if it's your mother...

72
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:21,525
Hey, Ai.

73
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:23,525
Go on and do it for them.

74
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,725
I'm sure their mother will come in the meantime.

75
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,626
Okay.

76
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:32,325
Please come this way.

77
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,225
Okay.

78
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,825
How is it?

79
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,326
Do I look very different?

80
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,625
Yeah.

81
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,726
-Pre... -Very pretty!

82
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,925
I guess you do look different in a way.

83
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:52,125
Where's your mother?

84
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,525
She died right after I was born.

85
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:56,826
What?

86
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:00,925
Okay! Let's go to lunch, Ayumi!

87
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,025
Yep!

88
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:04,025
Hey! Wait, you guys!

89
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:06,325
Are you planning to go to the restaurant like that?

90
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,726
Hey!

91
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,326
They didn't buy anything, after all.

92
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,025
Boy, did I eat!

93
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,525
I'm full!

94
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,025
The portions were just right, too.

95
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,026
Yep!

96
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:33,026
Well, we did share 3 adult servings among the 6 of us, after all.

97
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,525
They took of their make-up, after all.

98
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,425
So, what is it, Doc?

99
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:42,025
There's something good coming up after this too, right?

100
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,425
What? What is it?

101
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,125
Well, you see...

102
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,025
Together with the meal ticket here,

103
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,625
I also won a gift certificate

104
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:53,125
for this department store at the lottery, too!

105
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,725
-No joke? -Wow!

106
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:57,625
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

107
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,525
So, I was thinking of using the 10,000 yen of this gift certificate

108
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:03,826
to get you guys Christmas presents...

109
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,625
What? Where did they go?

110
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,225
Over there.

111
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:12,025
I always wanted a telescope from before!

112
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,425
I want a baseball bat and glove!

113
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,226
I want a big stuffed doll.

114
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,725
Well...

115
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,325
I... I only won 10,000 yen.

116
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:25,826
Then, I guess I'll go take a look at the newest Fusae brand pouch.

117
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:30,025
Even Ai's acting like them.

118
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,125
Did you ask for me?

119
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,625
Are you the Chef of this restaurant?

120
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:39,025
Yes, sir. I'm the head chef of this restaurant.

121
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,525
Was there any problem with the food?

122
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:46,825
No, my husband insists that the secret ingredient in this soup is miso.

123
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:49,225
Yes, I used Haccho Miso.

124
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,825
I'm amazed you noticed.

125
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,925
See! I was right, wasn't I?

126
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,825
My, I'm amazed.

127
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,925
-Chef. -What?

128
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,425
You've got a call from that complainer again.

129
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:04,325
You mean the one with the strange voice?

130
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,625
He says he wants to talk to you directly

131
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:09,625
because he's at this department store today.

132
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:14,125
But I don't want him coming here making a fuss.

133
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,825
Then, tell him to wait at the stairs near the restaurant,

134
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:19,425
30 minutes from now!

135
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:20,426
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:27,425
I guess I'll go look for the children.

137
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,625
I don't think you need to.

138
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,225
I've been getting mails from them

139
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:34,226
saying they found what they want you to buy for them so to come over.

140
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,625
Moreover, photos are attached to all of them.

141
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,925
Let's see.

142
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:42,525
Genta is on the 7th floor where the sport equipment are.

143
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:46,325
Mitsuhiko is on the 5th floor where the camera shop is.

144
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,825
Ayumi is on the 4th floor where the toy department is.

145
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:54,226
Ai is on the 1st floor where they carry brand name bags and stuff.

146
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:59,625
They all really want me to buy them stuff.

147
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,625
What's wrong, Shinichi?

148
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,925
Nothing.

149
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,726
I was just thinking that 30 minutes had passed since then.

150
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,625
What was that voice just now?

151
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,825
It came from the stairs.

152
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,626
Please... Let me through!

153
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,225
If I remember correctly,

154
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,525
he's the chef of the restaurant we just went to.

155
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,626
Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself!

156
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:31,426
The perp went down...

157
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:37,425
Doc, call the ambulance and police right away!

158
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,325
Okay.

159
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,525
Hey, you guys. Can you hear me?

160
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,025
A person's been stabbed right now

161
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,625
at the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor.

162
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,925
The perp is fleeing using the stairs!

163
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,625
All those near the stairs,

164
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:52,225
be on the look out for anybody who comes running down the stairs.

165
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,925
Ai, go and tell the receptionist of this department of the circumstances

166
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:58,625
and tell them to stop anybody who is out of running and out of breath!

167
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:59,626
Okay!

168
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:02,625
All the rest of you just find the perp!

169
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:03,626
Just remember what the perp looks like,

170
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,925
what he's wearing, and his characteristics, that's all.

171
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:09,025
Okay? The perp's somebody who tried to stabbed a person to death!

172
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,825
You never know what he'd do if he finds out that he's been identified!

173
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:14,225
Don't try and do anything, understand?

174
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:15,526
Yes...

175
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,919
And? Through Conan's instructions,

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,219
the people who were stopped at the exit of this department store

177
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,619
are these three who were trying to rush out.

178
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,619
It seems all three were perspiring profusely.

179
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,419
I... I was looking for the restroom!

180
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,819
"Takashi Kamaya (26)" -Every restroom on every floor was occupied,

181
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,319
so I decided to use one at a convenience store near here,

182
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,119
but was stopped.

183
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,319
And you?

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,219
I was looking for my wallet.

185
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,719
"Mitsuko Shikama (38)" -I thought I left it somewhere,

186
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,919
so I was running around to places where I shopped today.

187
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,119
And? Did you find your wallet?

188
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,919
What? Yes.

189
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,119
I looked carefully and found it inside my bag.

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,819
Then, how about you?

191
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,319
I went to eat at the Thai restaurant here.

192
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,819
I'm a chef so I came to check on the taste.

193
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,319
"Masaru Miyadai (52)" -The sauteed vegetables that I ate there was so spicy

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,719
that I couldn't stop perspiring

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,219
so I wanted to go home right away to take a shower.

196
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,019
That's why I was in a rush.

197
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,219
All three of them seem to have their reasons.

198
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,119
Next, we need to get the testimonies of the children

199
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,219
who say they saw the perp.

200
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,719
They'll do fine!

201
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,319
They say they didn't see the perp's face

202
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,019
but they remember the characteristics!

203
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,519
-Right? -Yeah!

204
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,819
I saw, I saw!

205
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,119
No problem!

206
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,719
He was pretty small!

207
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,919
He had the number "2" on his clothes.

208
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,419
His clothes were gray!

209
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,919
The color was like what Ai is wearing now!

210
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,019
-Wrong. -What?

211
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,819
He was pretty big and was wearing dark gray clothes!

212
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,819
And he ran like a man!

213
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,019
Wrong! He was small!

214
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,419
Maybe he looked big to you because you're small built, Mitsuhiko?

215
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,619
No, I'm sure of what I saw!

216
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,519
He was a man of big built.

217
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,119
I thought it was a woman.

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,319
She was wearing light gray clothes that was almost white.

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,720
She was of normal height, a little taller than Doc!

220
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Hey, hey.

221
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,619
-I said he was small built! -We've got a problem here.

222
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,019
It's no mistake that he was big built!

223
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,019
-Their testimonies are all different! -Nope! It was a woman!

224
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,519
He was small built and wore gray clothes for sure!

225
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,819
No, he was big built wearing dark gray clothes!

226
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,919
She was a woman wearing bright gray clothes,

227
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,720
a little taller than Dr. Agasa!

228
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,719
Organizing what you all said...

229
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,819
The characteristics of the perp

230
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,619
who fled down the stairs after stabbing Mr. Hosogoe

231
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,419
near the stairs of the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor are...

232
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,919
According to Genta who was on the 7th floor,

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,019
was small built with the number 2 on his clothes

234
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,519
that were gray like the color that Ai is wearing now.

235
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,819
Yeah!

236
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,419
According to Mitsuhiko who was on the 5th floor,

237
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,419
he was a big built person who ran like a man,

238
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,319
and the clothes he was wearing looked dark gray.

239
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,719
That's right!

240
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,519
And according to Ayumi who was on the 4th floor,

241
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,719
the person was of normal height, a little taller than Dr. Agasa

242
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,619
and looked to be a woman wearing light gray clothes, right?

243
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,919
Yep!

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,719
But the clothes of all three of the people

245
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,119
who were trying to rush out of here and that we stopped, are all gray.

246
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,019
Yes, although the shade of gray is all different.

247
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,519
The one wearing gray similar to the clothes Ai is wearing

248
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,119
is Mr. Kamaya, right?

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,519
Don't be ridiculous!

250
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,519
I was really looking for a restroom that was unoccupied, I told you!

251
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,719
What's this?

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,419
It seems you hurt the finger of your right hand.

253
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,019
Oh, this...

254
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,519
I sprained my finger.

255
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,519
I bumped it against the restroom door because I was in a rush.

256
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,819
Besides, the other two brats were saying

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,619
that the gray was a darker or lighter gray.

258
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,019
Moreover, even that fat brat over there said that

259
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,419
the number 2 was on the clothes,

260
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,119
"Beika" -but on mine...

261
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,920
See! There're only kanji characters on it!

262
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,419
He's right.

263
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,019
Then, the one that Ayumi said was wearing light gray clothes...

264
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,519
Hey, hold it!

265
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,719
I told you, didn't I? I was looking for my wallet

266
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,019
and was running around the places I stopped by today.

267
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,319
But you found your wallet inside your bag, after all, didn't you?

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Why were you rushing out of the department store?

269
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,619
I rushed because I suddenly remembered that the TV drama I missed

270
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,419
was going to have a rerun at sundown today!

271
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,619
Do you have a cold?

272
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes, I was recovering but...

273
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,319
Since I perspired running around, I'm cold again

274
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,920
and maybe I caught it again.

275
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,819
It seems that you don't have the number 2 on your clothes either.

276
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,819
Well, the broche on your chest could look to be a number,

277
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,919
but it would be 6, not 2.

278
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,719
The only one left is Mr. Miyadai, you,

279
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,419
who Mitsuhiko said was wearing dark gray clothes.

280
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,619
Hey, hey.

281
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,519
I said I ate spicy hot food and perspired

282
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,719
so I wanted to go back home and take a shower as soon as possible.

283
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,519
That's why I was rushing out of the department store. I'm not lying.

284
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,219
The fact is, I heard rumors that

285
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,919
the soup of the Thai restaurant here

286
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,519
tastes a lot like the soup we serve, so...

287
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,919
You mean you came here to complain?

288
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,019
Yeah. Well, I tried it,

289
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,419
but it wasn't all that similar,

290
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,319
so I left without saying anything.

291
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,519
I see.

292
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,520
By the way, something's written on the back of your stadium jacket.

293
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,819
Yeah, but it's not a number.

294
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,720
Tokyo Spirits?

295
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,119
You've been wriggling your feet for a while.

296
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,219
I've got athlete's foot! You know, athlete's foot!

297
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,820
That's why I want to go home quickly and put medicine on it.

298
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,419
Now, for as to why Ayumi thought the perp was a woman.

299
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,619
Why did you think so?

300
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,519
Well, because...

301
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,719
I just had a feeling that she was a woman!

302
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
A...

303
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,919
Feeling?

304
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,220
Inspector Megure!

305
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,719
We found that the victim Mr. Hosogoe and those three

306
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,019
have a connection!

307
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,220
What?

308
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,619
Mr. Kamaya seems to have been part-timing until 2 years ago,

309
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,019
at a restaurant where the victim was the head chef.

310
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,619
But his attitude at work was bad so he was fired.

311
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,719
Ms. Shikama lives in the next room at the same condo as the victim.

312
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,119
But they seem to have had frequent arguments

313
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,019
about Ms. Shikama's dog being nosy.

314
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,119
And as for Mr. Miyadai, 3 years ago,

315
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,119
he seems to have made a fuss at the victim's restaurant

316
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,319
saying that the victim copied his cooking,

317
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,720
and the local police came to the scene.

318
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,319
I see.

319
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,919
It seems as to all three of you,

320
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,320
I need to ask you more things in detail.

321
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,019
Before that, can you ask the three if they have gloves on them?

322
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,220
-Gloves? -Yep!

323
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,619
Because there were no fingerprints on the knife, right?

324
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,219
If so, the perp probably was wearing gloves.

325
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,219
And maybe if blood got splattered on it,

326
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,520
I would probably throw it away.

327
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,819
Well?

328
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,919
I've got gloves.

329
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,319
Just in case.

330
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,620
After all, it's cold.

331
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,719
None of them have blood on.

332
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,419
According to the coroner,

333
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,119
the victim bled because he tried to pull the knife out himself,

334
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,119
so it's most likely that practically no blood splattered on the perp.

335
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,619
I see.

336
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,319
And how is the victim doing?

337
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,419
The surgery seems to have gone well,

338
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,620
but he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

339
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,219
At any rate,

340
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,220
I'll have to get the details from all of you in a different room.

341
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,519
We'll go too, then!

342
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,119
No, no!

343
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,419
From here, we the police do the job!

344
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,920
What?

345
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,719
Ghads, no joke!

346
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,419
Why won't they show us the interrogation?

347
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,219
Well, your eye-witness testimonies were so unreliable,

348
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,719
it can't be helped.

349
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,419
It wasn't unreliable!

350
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,219
-I really saw what I saw! -I'm not lying!

351
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,119
Cool it, cool it.

352
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,119
Okay. So Genta, the perp that you saw was small built

353
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,419
and had the number 2 on his clothes,

354
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,319
and he was wearing gray clothes just like Ai's. Is that true?

355
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Yeah.

356
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,419
Then, why didn't you see the face of the perp?

357
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,719
Well, because I was trying to use the stairs

358
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,619
to return from the sport equipment floor

359
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,719
but the members of the basketball team were in the way.

360
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,820
The members of the basketball team?

361
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,119
That's the Haido High School basketball club!

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,519
Their uniforms were ready today,

363
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,119
so the entire team came to pick them up.

364
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,619
I see.

365
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,019
They were all tall and they looked like adults

366
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,719
but when they got their uniforms,

367
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,619
they looked so happy and wore it on top of the clothes.

368
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,619
They were wearing saying, "I'm going to wear this home today!"

369
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,819
They were excited like children.

370
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,919
Do you know what kind of uniform it was?

371
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,419
Yeah, I do! I took a picture of it, you see.

372
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,720
There!

373
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,019
The uniform is gray like the clothes Ai is wearing.

374
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,319
Yeah.

375
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,519
That's right. The perp was wearing the same kind of gray.

376
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,619
And he went down the stairs

377
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,519
passing in front of the members of the basketball team

378
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,619
who were headed for the stairs!

379
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,019
Then, maybe the members of the basketball team saw the perp, too.

380
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,219
-I don't think so. -What?

381
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,719
Because I shouted, "Get out of the way" back then...

382
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,019
so I think they were all looking at me.

383
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,119
But basketball uniforms have numbers on them, don't they?

384
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,019
If so, then maybe you mistook the number 2

385
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,519
that was on the uniform of one of the members, for the perp's?

386
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,319
I didn't make a mistake!

387
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,419
Besides, only he was running!

388
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,919
Then, if it was full of numbers back then...

389
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,219
No. I'm sure that Genta saw the number 2!

390
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,019
Because there are no numbers 1, 2, and 3 in basketball.

391
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,319
See?

392
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,219
What? Why not?

393
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,719
The referees of basketball indicate

394
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
the players who commit violations with their fingers,

395
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,119
but since they also indicate the 1 point of free throws,

396
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,419
the 2 and 3 points of normal shoots with their fingers.

397
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,219
So, to avoid confusion, the International Basketball League decided

398
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,419
that the numbers from 1 to 3 won't be used on the uniforms.

399
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,019
Really?

400
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,519
But those three had no number 2 on them, right?

401
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,319
Right.

402
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,219
Only if you guys took pictures of the perp.

403
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,819
Then, you should've told us to do so to begin with!

404
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,919
What?

405
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,119
The picture that Genta took,

406
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,919
both your hands are full with the bat and glove,

407
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,319
but who took this picture?

408
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,119
A member of the basketball team that I told you about a while ago!

409
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,719
I see.

410
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,319
Mitsuhiko and Ai seem to have taken selfies.

411
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,919
You didn't take this picture yourself, did you, Ayumi?

412
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,019
Nope!

413
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,819
The kind salesclerk at the toy department took it!

414
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,919
When you called to say that

415
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,419
the person who stabbed somebody ran down the stairs,

416
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,019
she took me over to the stairs!

417
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,519
Then, maybe that salesclerk...

418
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
Also could've...

419
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,619
Witnessed the perp!

420
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,419
Okay, let's go to the toy department!

421
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,919
Aye...

422
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,919
Hey, the elevator's on the other side!

423
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,620
It's crowded so taking the stairs is faster!

424
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,119
"Next Episode" -So, who's the perp after all?

425
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,519
The perp went running down

426
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,520
slipping through the mannequins and the sign!

427
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,119
Will this do?

428
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,119
Ai, the button of your clothes...

429
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,919
But what I saw was "2", you know?

430
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,420
What's the matter? Is there something on my face?

431
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,719
Next Conan,

432
