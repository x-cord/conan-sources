1
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:06,656
It's from 4 pm tomorrow, finally.

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,756
-Yes. -Right.

3
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:10,356
Competition for first place

4
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:12,656
between the Tokyo Spirits and Big Osaka.

5
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:14,956
Since they were beaten by Big Osaka before,

6
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:17,356
the Spirits have to beat them this time.

7
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:19,256
But...

8
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:21,156
Since Hide of the Spirits

9
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,556
won't be able to play tomorrow because he's hurt,

10
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,856
I'll bet they'll be beaten up pretty badly.

11
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:31,056
Yes. Mr. Higo of Big won with the hat trick too,

12
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,056
so I'm sure that the big scorer

13
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,256
and victory will go to Big this year.

14
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,456
What?

15
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:40,556
Well, Mr. Higo won't be able to play in tomorrow's game

16
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:42,756
either because of the all the yellow card warnings he got.

17
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:44,856
What? Is that so?

18
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,756
I saw it on today's sports paper.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,556
"Two great players unable to play in the competition".

20
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:53,056
Come to think of it,

21
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,256
when Mr. Higo got the yellow card in a previous game,

22
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,556
the commentator seemed really disappointed,

23
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:00,956
so I felt a strange uncomfortable feeling.

24
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:04,056
But I guess he got caught in a really sly strategy.

25
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,456
A sly strategy?

26
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,756
She know what a hat trick is and yet,

27
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:12,156
she knows nothing about the yellow card accumulation warning?

28
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,856
But it's tough for both teams

29
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:17,756
since their point getters will not be able to play.

30
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:19,756
Talking of tough...

31
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:22,256
I've got to have a bad tooth pulled out

32
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:23,556
at the dentist tomorrow.

33
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,456
Oh no. That sounds tough.

34
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,456
Darn, Hide's not playing

35
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:29,356
and I don't want to go to the dentist either.

36
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,856
I wish that tomorrow never comes!

37
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:34,756
Hey, you shouldn't say that.

38
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:35,756
What?

39
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:38,956
Tomorrow is filled with hope.

40
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,256
Especially for children like you.

41
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,256
What's with you, mister?

42
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:46,556
"Kyozo Daita (62)" -Well, I'm just a retired man

43
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,256
who's passing time away, a mere passerby.

44
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,156
Then, do you have something interesting

45
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:52,956
happening to you tomorrow, mister?

46
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:56,956
Yes, I've got so much happening I don't know what to do.

47
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,556
I'm going to Osaka tomorrow

48
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,056
to watch a soccer game and...

49
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,156
Soccer?

50
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,556
After that, I've got an appointment

51
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,856
to see an old friend that I haven't seen

52
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:06,556
in ten years to drink with him...

53
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:08,156
The finale of the sequential drama

54
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:10,256
that I've been hooked on is also tomorrow.

55
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,956
And the Summer Big lottery!

56
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:15,556
The winning ticket will be announced tomorrow too.

57
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:19,256
I bought a lot this time so I'm really excited...

58
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:23,156
A purse snatcher?

59
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,756
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

60
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,856
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

61
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,856
There is a big fuss over some lottery tickets.

62
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,356
The phantom of FBI agent Akai appears off and on.

63
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

64
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,056
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

65
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:40,156
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:24,866
"A Red Omen That Summons Danger"

67
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:27,452
Thief!

68
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,252
You guys stay right here!

69
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,652
Conan.

70
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:31,652
Hold it!

71
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,752
I said hold it!

72
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,452
-Hey... -What's up?

73
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:47,952
He got away.

74
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,576
Conan.

75
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,076
Where's the purse snatcher?

76
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,776
He got away?

77
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:56,976
Yes.

78
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,876
I did get the man's bag back, though.

79
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:01,376
The zipper wasn't opened

80
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,676
so I don't think anything was stolen,

81
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,776
but I think you should confirm the contents.

82
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,676
Thank you.

83
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,076
Let's see.

84
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,876
My wallet, house key,

85
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:20,376
notebook, soccer ticket, glasses case.

86
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,376
Nothing seems to have been stolen.

87
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:25,776
There's a picture on your glasses case.

88
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:28,476
This is a picture of my granddaughter

89
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:31,176
who's turning seven this year.

90
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:34,776
These glasses are what my granddaughter chose

91
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,076
for my birthday present.

92
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,776
That's why it's a thing a really cherish.

93
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,576
Seven years old...

94
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,876
She's the same age as me.

95
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,176
Does she go to Teitan elementary school?

96
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:50,376
No. I wonder what school it was?

97
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,576
Here, your lottery tickets.

98
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:56,076
I think I retrieved everything I saw.

99
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,576
You picked them up for me?

100
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,376
I picked some up too.

101
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,876
I picked three up.

102
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,376
I picked up five.

103
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,376
Thank you so much for everything.

104
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:08,576
You not only got my bag back for me,

105
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,176
you even picked my lottery tickets up for me too.

106
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:11,576
It's only natural.

107
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,276
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

108
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:16,476
We're always there for people in trouble.

109
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,776
Youth... Youth Detective Squad?

110
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:23,676
Yes. We've cooperated to solve real cases at times too.

111
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,176
We know a lot of police officers too.

112
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,876
That's really something.

113
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,076
So, I'd like to treat you,

114
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,176
the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

115
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:35,276
to dessert but do you have time?

116
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:36,276
We do! We do!

117
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:37,776
We've got a lot of time!

118
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,276
Then, shall we go to a cake shop nearby.

119
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,776
-All right! -All right!

120
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,576
The game you're going to go see tomorrow

121
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,676
is the Big vs. Spirits game?

122
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:55,476
Right, I've got the ticket too, see.

123
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:58,276
I've bought tickets for a good seat.

124
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,576
Awesome.

125
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:02,576
I like both Hide and Higo,

126
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:05,076
so I can't wait to see them compete against each other.

127
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,276
What?

128
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:10,576
No. I mean... those two are...

129
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,376
It's you, Omi.

130
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,976
Let's stay up all night tomorrow, like old times.

131
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:22,776
What? You've come up with something

132
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,276
so you've got to go home by 10 pm at night?

133
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,476
Hey, hey, then we'll only be able to drink together

134
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:29,676
for just about an hour!

135
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:33,176
Would you like to start drinking from about 7 pm then?

136
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:35,676
After all, we're both retired and have a lot of time on our hands.

137
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:39,176
I'll contact the shop then.

138
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:42,576
Okay, then, I'll be looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.

139
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,476
Don't let my aged face surprise you.

140
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:46,776
See you.

141
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:54,776
Got to change the time we start drinking to 7 pm at night.

142
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:56,776
Really...

143
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,076
Your schedule for tomorrow is filled.

144
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,576
It is, isn't it?

145
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:04,176
Washing machine is written on your schedule today?

146
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:08,076
Yes. I'm going to Akihabara to buy myself one from now.

147
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:10,376
The one I have now broke down.

148
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:11,576
I've been going to the coin laundry

149
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,676
because of this recently.

150
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,176
Well, taking loose coins with me,

151
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:16,876
wearing a T-shirt and jersey bottom

152
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,576
and going to do my wash,

153
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:21,076
reading the newspaper passing my time away

154
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:24,376
isn't all that bad and I kind of enjoy it.

155
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,876
Talking about coin laundry...

156
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,176
I just can't wait to see

157
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,476
Detective Saimonji's "Coin Laundry Murder".

158
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,576
The case will be solved in tomorrow's episode, right?

159
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:37,276
Yes, yes, I'm hooked on that drama too.

160
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:40,776
I can't wait to figure out who the culprit is.

161
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:43,176
According to my deduction,

162
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,376
I think it's that nice looking person...

163
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:45,976
I know!

164
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,776
Who the culprit of that drama.

165
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,976
Because I read the original novel before.

166
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,076
-What? -No... joke?

167
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,576
Don't tell us,

168
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,876
because I'm looking forward to finding out.

169
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,876
Of course, I won't tell you.

170
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:03,676
Won't you tell me secretly who the culprit is?

171
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,376
What? Are you sure? It's going to be aired tomorrow.

172
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:08,676
Well, I've got a drinking date,

173
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,776
and I won't be able to see it live anyway so...

174
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,776
But, aren't you going to recorded or something anyway?

175
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,976
Then, I'd suggest that you watch it closely.

176
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:20,176
Yes. I guess so.

177
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,676
See you, then. Thanks so much for everything today.

178
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:29,476
Youth Detective Squad.

179
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,276
My name is Kyozo Daita.

180
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:35,476
If we meet again somewhere, remember me, okay?

181
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,076
-Okay! -Okay!

182
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:42,076
He sure was a strange man.

183
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,676
Yes. He was full of hope for tomorrow.

184
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,176
He sure was.

185
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:51,576
"Beika Station"

186
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,976
The train will be entering platform two.

187
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,676
Please stand behind the white line for your safety.

188
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:07,876
Yoshimi, hang on.

189
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:15,776
I'll help you in a minute...

190
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,576
It's going to hurt...

191
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,376
If you get run over by the train.

192
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,776
Beika, Beika Station.

193
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:37,476
Thank you for riding with us today.

194
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:40,576
Please do not forget your belongings.

195
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:09,076
You were planning to throw yourself on the tracks, weren't you?

196
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,476
To make money for your granddaughter's surgery, right?

197
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:12,476
What?

198
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,776
Did you have a very expensive life insurance or something?

199
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,676
How'd you know?

200
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:22,276
Because although you're saying

201
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:24,076
that you're looking forward to tomorrow,

202
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,776
you're thinking that you could care less about tomorrow.

203
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,476
I could care less?

204
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:30,976
The Big vs. Spirits game.

205
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,776
Although you're going all the way to Osaka to watch the game,

206
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,376
you don't even know that Hide and Higo aren't going to be playing.

207
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,976
It's strange that you're going to that game

208
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,076
that's going to start at 4 pm

209
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:41,476
and coming back to Tokyo in three hours

210
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:42,776
to go drink with a friend.

211
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,576
The game's going to take at least two hours.

212
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:46,576
You couldn't possibly make it back to Tokyo from Osaka

213
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,776
in just an hour that you have left.

214
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,076
Besides! The lottery tickets that we picked up,

215
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:55,476
you put them back in your bag without even checking.

216
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:56,576
It's strange that you also wanted to know

217
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,076
result of the drama that will be aired tomorrow too.

218
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:02,876
It's almost as if you're sure that there's no tomorrow for you.

219
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:04,676
That's how we figured out

220
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:07,676
you were planning to die today.

221
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:11,976
Well, Conan told us all this, though.

222
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,776
You drank because you wanted to make it look like you got drunk

223
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,476
and accidentally fell of the platform.

224
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:20,176
If after the accident, a soccer game ticket and lottery ticket

225
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:22,176
are found in your possession

226
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,576
followed by the testimonies of us and other people,

227
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:29,176
the authorities will found that you were looking forward to tomorrow,

228
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,576
nobody would think that you committed suicide

229
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,176
in order to get hold of your life insurance money.

230
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,476
In other words,

231
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:37,076
your insurance policy was one in which you can't receive money after death,

232
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:38,776
if you commit suicide, right?

233
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,876
But, how did you ever find out about my granddaughter's illness?

234
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,876
If the glasses that your granddaughter

235
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,076
sent you was the treasure you cherished most,

236
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:49,376
you should at least have known

237
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:51,776
the name of the school she goes to.

238
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:53,876
But, you didn't know.

239
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,476
Which means that she may be in a circumstance

240
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,476
that is keeping her from going to school.

241
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,176
That's how I deduced that she maybe in a hospital somewhere.

242
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:06,776
Yes. She's been in the hospital since six months ago.

243
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:10,376
She has a heart problem.

244
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,976
We finally found a good doctor

245
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,576
and she was scheduled to undergo surgery abroad soon,

246
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,076
but the surgery fee is so high.

247
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:21,476
That I had no choice but to do this.

248
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,576
But, even if she gets better after the surgery,

249
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,776
if she finds out that her grandpa is gone, she'll be sad.

250
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:30,876
Besides, didn't you buy a lot of lottery tickets?

251
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,776
You could have a winning ticket.

252
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,576
I would never have a winning ticket.

253
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,076
How could the same person win a succession

254
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,776
of winning lottery tickets amounting to a billion yen?

255
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,076
-What? A succession... -What?

256
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,576
You mean you already won once?

257
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:45,476
Yes. At the end of last month.

258
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:48,776
I thanked God with all my heart.

259
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:52,276
But, I lost the winning lottery ticket.

260
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,976
And I can't find them no matter where I look.

261
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,176
-What? -What?

262
00:13:57,176 --> 00:14:00,376
Could it be that you confirmed the winning lottery ticket number

263
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:03,076
at the laundry when you were reading the papers?

264
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,976
Yes. When I got home, the ticket was gone.

265
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:10,276
So, I could've dropped it on my way home.

266
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,776
What about the other tickets?

267
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:14,376
I didn't want to get mixed up

268
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,076
so I threw them away right then and there.

269
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:19,876
Then, I'm sure you put your winning ticket away somewhere.

270
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,076
But, it would be dangerous

271
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,176
to shove it into your jersey pants pocket.

272
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,976
You would've put it into your wallet,

273
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:28,876
but you were holding a lot of loose coins,

274
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:31,876
so I presume you didn't have it with you, right?

275
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,976
If so, the only place left that you would put it would be...

276
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,576
in the glasses case you had with you then, wouldn't it?

277
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,976
I see.

278
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,076
I found it.

279
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,876
But, how did you figure out he brought his glasses case along?

280
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:52,976
Because when he wrote in his notebook,

281
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,776
he was squinting.

282
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,776
Those glasses are probably for myopia.

283
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:00,176
If he confirmed the winning ticket reading the newspaper,

284
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,076
he should've brought it along with him!

285
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:06,076
He never opened his glasses case after he lost the ticket

286
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:07,676
because he felt bad towards his granddaughter

287
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,776
and couldn't wear his glasses.

288
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,276
Besides, he didn't need his glasses for myopia

289
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:14,476
to look for what he lost.

290
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:18,376
I even thought of robbing a bank too,

291
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,076
but I'm glad I didn't.

292
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,776
Hey, hey.

293
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:27,576
No, no, you shouldn't do bad things.

294
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,276
Right, right.

295
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,476
Thank you so very much,

296
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,276
members of the Youth Detective Squad.

297
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:39,876
I'll be sure to pay you back for your kindness some day later.

298
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:42,376
See you.

299
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,576
What a guy.

300
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,476
We just ran into a band of bank robbers the other day too.

301
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:53,276
Yes. That really got us nervous, didn't it?

302
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:55,676
Yes, yes, there were people

303
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,976
that we knew among the customers there too.

304
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,076
Someone you knew? Not teacher Jodie?

305
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,776
Remember? The man who was riding the same bus

306
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,876
when there was the bus-jack.

307
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:07,976
Yes, the guy with the mean looking eyes, right?

308
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,576
I saw him too.

309
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:12,876
I'm sure he had a burn mark on his right eye.

310
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:16,076
I don't remember a guy like that during the bus-jack.

311
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:20,076
Nope. During the bus-jack he didn't have a burn.

312
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,676
I think he was wearing a black knitted cap

313
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,076
and a mask over his mouth.

314
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:26,876
What?

315
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,665
"Mouri Detective Agency"

316
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:33,043
What? Akai?

317
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,043
Yes, he mentioned over the phone

318
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,543
about a red long sleeve T-shirt.

319
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,643
Something about solving the mystery of red T-shirts

320
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:42,643
that come in the mail every week.

321
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,443
The person will be coming after lunch tomorrow

322
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,243
and wants dad to help.

323
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,743
She was talking about the color red.

324
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:56,443
And? Did you get the name

325
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,543
and address of the guy who called?

326
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,943
No, because after saying what he had to say,

327
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,143
he hung up.

328
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:06,543
Well, it's just probably some university girl

329
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,943
being chased around by a stalker or something.

330
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:11,443
The voice of the person sounded mechanical

331
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:14,343
and I couldn't figure out if it was a woman or a man.

332
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,343
It's sort of scary.

333
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:17,943
If it seemed like a bad case,

334
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:21,443
we can refuse when that person comes.

335
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:28,043
Either way, the person who is troubled with red T-shirts

336
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,443
is coming here tomorrow anyway.

337
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:33,943
That person isn't coming here to the agency

338
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,643
but rather to the sports goods floor

339
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:37,743
of the Beika Department Store on 3rd Avenue.

340
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:39,043
What?

341
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,043
Why do we have to go all the way to meet this person

342
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:44,043
that we know nothing about from our side?

343
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,443
But... We already ate it all up.

344
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,743
-What? -What?

345
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:50,543
We ate it?

346
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:52,943
When I came back from school today,

347
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:54,843
I found an envelope in the mailbox with the words

348
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:57,143
request for work fee.

349
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,643
I looked inside and found 100,00 yen inside.

350
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,143
Then, don't tell me that this sushi.

351
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:05,543
Yes, I also paid up the debts that we owed

352
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,443
to Poirot with the money.

353
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:10,043
I mistakenly thought that it was payment

354
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,543
for the case that you solved last week.

355
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,843
By the I was told on the phone

356
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:18,843
that the money is inside the mailbox,

357
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:21,743
I had already ordered the sushi.

358
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,443
My God.

359
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:25,643
Beika Department Store.

360
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,443
That's right near the Teito Bank

361
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,943
that was robbed the other day.

362
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:37,543
"Beika Department Store"

363
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:40,343
The mystery of the red T-shirt?

364
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,343
A person who wants you to solve the mystery

365
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,143
will be coming here?

366
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,943
Yes, after lunch.

367
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,143
Have you seen such a person?

368
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:51,843
No. But why here?

369
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:55,343
Well... I wonder why?

370
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,743
Maybe it's a different place?

371
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:01,943
Hey, hey, are you saying that we have to look around this entire floor?

372
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,143
Come to think of it,

373
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,143
there was a person who came to ask about a hat.

374
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:08,043
What? A hat?

375
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,443
See, that foreigner over there.

376
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,843
Hey, come on, don't let me keep repeating myself!

377
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:15,243
The design in the back of this cap

378
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,443
is the original design of this department store!

379
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:20,043
In other words, it's limited edition item of this store, isn't it?

380
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:23,443
Don't you remember the customer who bought this here?

381
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:27,543
No. Besides, I've never heard if the customer

382
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,743
that you are referring to has ever come here either.

383
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:34,243
Hey... it's about time you tell me, isn't it?

384
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:35,443
What are you getting at?

385
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,243
What about the customer who bought that cap?

386
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,143
Never mind, you just be quiet.

387
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,943
Jodie?

388
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,043
Agent Camel too?

389
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,043
What brings you here?

390
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:49,143
I happen to be checking on something.

391
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:52,143
By the way, your Japanese is fluent.

392
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,943
Well, that's...

393
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,243
because Camel here.

394
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:01,443
Right. My Japanese improved.

395
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,143
Because I love Japan. Does it bother you?

396
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:06,043
No.

397
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,343
She cuts out explaining.

398
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,843
Jodie, isn't she the FBI agent

399
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,343
who was teaching English at high school?

400
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,043
Didn't you go back to the States?

401
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,343
No, because I still have some petty business

402
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,443
to take care of here in Japan.

403
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,443
He... he's my partner, Agent Camel.

404
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:26,043
I think I'll be in Japan for a while.

405
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:28,943
If we meet again someday, please remember me.

406
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,943
Well, I guess it has nothing to do with the mystery...

407
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,243
Of the red T-shirt.

408
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:42,243
Okay, let's try the golf goods sales floor next then.

409
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:45,343
Excuse me, do you know the foreign lady just now,

410
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,743
didn't she mention something other than the cap?

411
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,643
Yes, she kept asking if a man with

412
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:53,543
a burn mark on the right side of his cheek

413
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,543
came to buy the cap.

414
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:58,043
A burn mark on the right cheek?

415
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,943
Which means that even Jodie saw him.

416
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,143
That man that was among the customers

417
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,743
during the bank robbery.

418
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,843
Shu.

419
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,543
Come on, Conan, let's go.

420
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,043
Thank you.

421
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,043
No problem.

422
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,243
Excuse me.

423
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,843
Yes?

424
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:23,043
Could I ask you something?

425
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:25,443
"Beika Department Store"

426
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,743

00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,443
Really, I tell you.

430
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:40,543
It's after 1 pm already.

431
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:42,543
The client hasn't shown up yet.

432
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:45,643
We're done.

433
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:46,743
Finished. That's it.

434
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,943
We're going home.

435
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,743
I wonder what this paper bag is?

436
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:00,243
Maybe somebody forgot it?

437
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:03,743
I don't think you should touch it.

438
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:04,943
What?

439
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:09,943
I'm sure the contents is a bomb.

440
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:11,943
-Bomb? -A bomb?

441
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,543
A bomb?

442
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:16,043
Just how do you know?

443
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,543
That's because...

444
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:19,843
I...

445
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,643
Look at me.

446
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,943
That's why.

447
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:29,743
-A bomb? -A bomb?

448
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:00,143
Get out of here! This area is dangerous.

449
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,743
Why do you have something like that on your body?

450
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,243
He wanted to find

451
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:09,243
the sender who puts of the 13 red T-shirts in this bag.

452
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:11,743
He needs to be found at any cost.

453
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,543
Red T-shirts?

454
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:17,743
What is he after anyway?

455
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:20,243
