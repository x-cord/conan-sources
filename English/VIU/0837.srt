1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
After school, Sonoko suggests

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,000
to Ran and Sera at Poirot that they make a girls' band.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,300
Therefore, Amuro and I who happened to be there,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,800
went to a rental studio to practice.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
But the members of a girls' band that we run into there...

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,500
Is she dead?

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Hey. Hagie?

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
No joke?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hagie? Hagie?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Nothing was on the security camera.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,700
And the murder weapon isn't found either.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,900
However, Sera is wary of Amuro.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,400
And? And?

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Did you get his name?

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
No, I didn't.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,200
But another man who came to the platform called him.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,500
Scotch!

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
But, the man who called him that

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
had his hat deep over his eyes

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,800
so I didn't get a good view of what he looked like.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,000
He looked very similar to you, Amuro!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
It's someone else.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Never mind such old time stories.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
Why don't we get to solving the case that just happened here?

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,500
You're a detective too, aren't you?

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,800
Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
A canvas stained black with crime.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,200
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,300
Bourbon and Scotch are bothersome.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,600
But first priority is to figure out where the murder weapon disappeared.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,200
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,900
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,760
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 2)"

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,560
What?

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,060
You want to body check us once more?

37
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,060
You check us thoroughly earlier, didn't you?

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,260
Well, just to be sure, you see.

39
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,860
Maybe you haven't found the murder weapon yet?

40
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,160
That's why you think that we have it hidden somewhere on us, right?

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,860
Don't tell us you think we swallowed it or something?

42
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,660
If so, take an X-Ray picture or whatever!

43
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,760
That's fine if it's going to clear us of suspicion.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,560
By the way, did you check the members of the other bands too?

45
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
No, not yet.

46
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,160
Because Hagie used to argue a lot with the members of other bands.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,460
They could've had a grudge against her.

48
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,060
The other time too, a band that we met at a live house said.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,860
What's this? You guys are still playing?

50
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,660
I thought your vocalist dropped dead.

51
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,860
This freckled face one is going to sing in her place, right?

52
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,460
Poor thing.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,860
Well, your vocalist lost her voice and committed suicide.

54
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,660
You don't have a choice, do you?

55
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,660
The vocalist who committed suicide?

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,760
A girl called Akane Shuto.

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,160
She had a nice voice.

58
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Anybody on the outside could've seen

59
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,760
that half the security camera's image was cut off

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,260
if they looked at the monitor at the reception, right?

61
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Yes.

62
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,960
If someone knew that they always did so,

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,460
they could've searched and found which studio they were using.

64
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,760
Which means that someone from the outside

65
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,960
could've snuck into the room,

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,160
strangled the victim and leave with the murder weapon.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,960
It's just as the girls say.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,260
I guess we need to investigate the members of other bands too.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,760
Oh, but since we only had our eyes on these three,

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,560
we let two or three groups leave already.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,760
Tell them to get back here immediately!

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,060
Excuse me.

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,860
Which of you first suggested to form a band?

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,460
Hagie.

76
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,460
We were classmates in college.

77
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,360
One day Hagie brought Akane along saying that she found a good vocalist,

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
so we formed a band.

79
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,360
Akane not only sang but could play the guitar, bass and keyboard too.

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,260
So, she taught us a lot of things.

81
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,060
But, Akane couldn't do anything girls could do.

82
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,560
Hagie taught her how to cook

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,760
and I taught her about make-up and fashion.

84
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,960
I tried to teach Akane sewing and embroidery too,

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,160
but she wouldn't stick with things like that for long.

86
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,060
The only thing she kept up with was knitting that Rumi taught her.

87
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,260
Yes, but all of you that I taught along with Akane

88
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,360
got better at it than me.

89
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,460
Come to think of it,

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,060
I want to see the video of your practice session that you took.

91
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,160
Sure thing.

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,760
Since the power was switched off when we weren't practicing,

93
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,160
I don't think the perp is in it.

94
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
See!

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,260
Didn't you turn it in to the police?

96
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,560
The officer we saw earlier gave it back to me

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,560
saying that it seemed to have nothing to do with the case.

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
After all, it's our last performance with Hagie.

99
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Why was the video shot vertically?

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,460
I think the band would fit in better if it was shot horizontally.

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,960
Oh, we decided to shoot it vertically

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,560
so that our feet wouldn't be cut off, right?

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Yeah.

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,860
Because it's not like a TV screen and more interesting that way.

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
I see.

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,860
So, that's the story.

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,960
Seriously?

108
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,860
Haven't you found the murder weapon yet?

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,460
No, sir.

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,760
The victim Ms. Hagie Yamaji

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,460
was strangled using a rope like weapon,

112
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,560
and Yoshikawa lines that indicate she resisted when being choked

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
are found on her neck.

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,860
In other words, the murder weapon with Ms. Yamaji's blood on it

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,360
should be somewhere in this studio

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
and yet it can't be found. Why not?

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,860
We've checked all the string like things we could possibly find,

118
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,260
but detected no luminol reaction.

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,460
Come to think of it, a band member Someka Kibune

120
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,860
replaced the strings of her guitar, didn't she?

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,460
Of course we checked her guitar first thing, but found nothing.

122
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,460
So maybe the string was cut into pieces and flushed down the toilet?

123
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,060
We thought of that too, but...

124
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,960
We also examined the scissors in Ms. Tadako Fuekawa's sewing kit

125
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,760
and Ms. Rumi Kogure's nail clipper

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,460
but found nothing.

127
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,060
If these were used to cut a string with blood on it,

128
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,660
blood reaction would've been detected.

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,460
So, maybe a member from another band strangled Ms. Yamaji,

130
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,360
and left with the murder weapon, after all.

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,460
In that case,

132
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,560
I think the murder weapon would've been disposed of already.

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,860
If only the forensics can find a piece of the perp's skin

134
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,960
under the fingernails of Ms. Yamaji's body,

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
it could serve as a clue.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,460
It seems that she was strangled from behind,

137
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,460
so the chance of her having scratched the perp is slight.

138
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,360
And? Did you call back the members of the other bands that went home?

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,560
Well, there were two or three people that we couldn't get a hold of,

140
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,460
-so not all of them are here. -No need for that!

141
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,960
Because the perp hasn't fled from here yet.

142
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
What?

143
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,660
Hasn't fled?

144
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,460
Then, the perp is...

145
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Yes.

146
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
It means that the perp is among the three members

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,360
in the same band as Ms. Yamaji.

148
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
-What? -What? Seriously?

149
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,460
Why don't we just go to the break room in the basement

150
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,460
where all the girls are left waiting?

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
What?

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,960
The perp who killed Hagie is among us three?

153
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,560
You still insist on it?

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,160
Well, we, the police are not the ones saying that actually.

155
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,360
The one's helping us with the investigation are.

156
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,960
Geez.

157
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
I don't care if you think you're detectives.

158
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,260
But none of us have the string-like weapon.

159
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,060
So I don't see why we should be suspected.

160
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,260
If you insist that we got rid of the murder weapon,

161
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,360
it should be somewhere in this studio, right?

162
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,260
Did you find it?

163
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,960
No, not yet.

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,460
If so, we're innocent, right?

165
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,060
I wish you'd let us go already.

166
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,360
But...

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
There's no way we'll find it.

168
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,660
Because the murder weapon has already been taken out of this studio.

169
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,260
Hey, just what're you talking about?

170
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,260
We haven't stepped foot out of this room, you know?

171
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,160
How would we be able to get the murder weapon out of the room?

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,360
Because you're not the ones who took it outside.

173
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,460
It was the police.

174
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
What?

175
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,960
Because you're not the ones who took it outside.

176
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,760
It was the police.

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,860
What?

178
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,460
The police took the belongings and things the victim had on

179
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,360
to the station now, to investigate them, right?

180
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah.

181
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,960
But there weren't any string like things in her belongings.

182
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,360
What if that string like thing was knitted into something

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
that looked totally different?

184
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,260
Don't tell me that...

185
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,860
Yeah, the knitted cap that Hagie was wearing.

186
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
The murder weapon was the yarn that was knitted into that cap!

187
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,360
The yarn was knitted in?

188
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,460
The perp probably

189
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,660
prepared beforehand yarn of the same color as Hagie's knitted cap.

190
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,160
Then, after strangling her to death using that yarn,

191
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,060
removed the decoration that was on the edge of the knitted cap once,

192
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,360
and knitted in the yarn that was used to commit the crime to that area,

193
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,160
replaced the decoration and put the cap on Hagie again.

194
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,260
If the folded part of the knitted cap is raised a bit more than before,

195
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,460
no one would really notice.

196
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,760
But don't you use two pointed sticks

197
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
called knitting needles when knitting?

198
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,860
None of the girls had anything like that on them, right?

199
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,060
They were there!

200
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,860
Near the lady who died.

201
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,560
-What? -They were there?

202
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,860
See, on top of the snare drum to the left of the victim.

203
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,560
The drum sticks that you use to play the drums with!

204
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,360
If you use those two sticks skillfully, maybe you can knit with them?

205
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,460
True.

206
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,760
I guess you could.

207
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,860
All three of them were in the studio

208
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,160
for only a matter of 10 minutes when they went to wake Hagie up.

209
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,060
Tadako was sewing the button onto Someka's jacket.

210
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,860
I also sewed on her cuffs that came apart!

211
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,260
Someka was replacing the broken guitar string.

212
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,960
I told you I was also tuning my guitar, right?

213
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,460
And Rumi, you were revising your song, correct?

214
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,860
Yes, while playing the keyboard.

215
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,760
I don't think the three had time to knit.

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,660
There's one person

217
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,560
who was able to prepare beforehand among them, isn't there?

218
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,360
You could've prepared beforehand, right?

219
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,060
Ms. Rumi Kogure.

220
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,160
I see!

221
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Someka's jacket button coming off

222
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,860
and the guitar string broking were by coincidence!

223
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,460
Moreover, the guitar was one that she had rented today at the studio,

224
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,860
so the strings couldn't have been rigged to break off easily.

225
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,260
But as for revising the song,

226
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,060
if the revision was done beforehand while at home,

227
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,660
all that needs to be done is to rewrite it the same way at the studio.

228
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,060
I see!

229
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,360
Moreover, unlike the others,

230
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,960
Rumi had her back facing the security camera,

231
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,060
so she could've been pretending to play the keyboard

232
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,460
when she was actually knitting, right?

233
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060
I see.

234
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,660
It seems you were good enough to teach others to knit too, right?

235
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,460
But, I can knit too.

236
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,560
In the first place, unless you hide half of the security camera,

237
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,660
you can't commit the crime, right?

238
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,960
Right? Rumi.

239
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,360
Yes.

240
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,960
We set the cell phone onto a selfie stick, then onto a mic stand.

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,960
The fact that it was place right in front of the security camera

242
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,260
was a mere coincidence.

243
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,960
The three of us decided where to put it

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,460
by looking at the image displayed on the cell phone

245
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,160
and exchanging opinions.

246
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,760
Or are you saying that we all worked together

247
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,360
to position the cell phone in a way as to block off the security camera?

248
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
We've already figured out that trick

249
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,360
after watching the video on your cell phone of you performing.

250
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,060
What?

251
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,660
I saw that video too but I didn't notice anything in particular.

252
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,560
Will you show it to me once more?

253
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,760
Yes.

254
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,760
What about this helped you figure it out?

255
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,860
The positions in which all of them are.

256
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,560
The positions they're in?

257
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,460
The position of the drums is set to begin with and cannot be changed.

258
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,560
The two playing the guitar and the bass

259
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
will stay within the frame no matter how they move.

260
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
The position of the cell phone used to take that video

261
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,060
depends on keyboardist Rumi, who is in the upper left corner.

262
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,860
In other words, only Rumi would've been able to control

263
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,160
where the cell phone was to be set

264
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,960
depending on where she put her keyboard.

265
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,160
What?

266
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,860
I'm saying that you could've have controlled it

267
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,460
so that the cell phone would hide half the image on the security camera.

268
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,760
If she got too close to the drums,

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,560
the cell phone would also come close

270
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,660
and pull away from the security camera

271
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,760
and prevent her from blocking it.

272
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,860
On the other hand, if she pulled away from the drums,

273
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,260
the phone would pull away too

274
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,560
and she would frame out from the security camera.

275
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,460
In this way, you blocked off half the image of the security camera,

276
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,460
pretended to go to wake Hagie who was sleeping in the studio

277
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,060
and choked her to death using the yarn that you had prepared beforehand.

278
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,060
Then you knitted in that yarn to Hagie's cap using the drumsticks

279
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,360
while pretending to revise the song!

280
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,560
You put the cap back onto Hagie

281
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,160
and left to go back to the break room as if nothing had happened.

282
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,060
Am I wrong?

283
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,160
But, then she had to know beforehand that

284
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,360
Hagie would be sleeping by the drums...

285
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,260
I think Someka mentioned earlier that

286
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,960
Hagie always used to sleep in that fashion.

287
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
If she had a habit of sleeping that way,

288
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,060
after putting a sleeping drug in her drink,

289
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,060
it would've been easy to assume that

290
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,160
she would go off to the studio alone to take a nap on the drums.

291
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,060
Well, if the trash boxes of this rental studio are searched,

292
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,660
I'm sure the PET bottle laced with the sleeping drug will be found.

293
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,160
Okay! Search on the double!

294
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Yes, sir!

295
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,460
Oh, and tell the forensics to check the knitted cap of the victim!

296
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,660
Yes, sir!

297
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,360
Ms. Rumi Kogure. Will you please come to the station with me?

298
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,460
Rumi.

299
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,060
But what about the scissors?

300
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,860
Without scissors to cut the yarn with,

301
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,160
the pompoms can't be removed, can they?

302
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,060
You used the nail clipper, right?

303
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,060
-What? -You figured Tadako would lend them to you

304
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,860
if your nails were long.

305
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,660
You just imagined all this, right?

306
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,360
You don't have any proof that I did it, do you?

307
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
-It's all too obvious. -What?

308
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,260
Because you went out of your way to borrow the nail clippers

309
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
but you didn't cut your nails!

310
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,660
Which means that you knew that you wouldn't be practicing today, right?

311
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,260
So you wouldn't have to cut your nails.

312
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,160
Besides, along with the murder weapon yarn with Hagie's blood on it,

313
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,360
I think they'll also find your fingerprints.

314
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,060
Modern forensic investigators can even collect fingerprints

315
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,360
from the fluffy surface of tennis balls.

316
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,660
That's all baloney!

317
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,960
Rumi couldn't have used that knitted cap as a tool to commit murder!

318
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,660
Right! Because she knitted that cap together with Akane

319
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,860
who she was best friends with.

320
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,960
That's right.

321
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,460
I used that knitted cap because it was something that Akane knitted.

322
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,360
So that Hagie could get a taste of Akane's hatred!

323
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
What?

324
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,560
You know why, Akane ruined her throat, right?

325
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,960
It was because of what drunk Hagie told her, right?

326
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
That she wanted more depth in her voice.

327
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,260
Right! Akane took it seriously

328
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,560
and gargled using liquor that she couldn't take

329
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,860
or covering her face with a cushion and yelling at the top of her lungs

330
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,960
in an attempt to attain a husky voice, which she finally acquired.

331
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,060
But Hagie had the nerve to tell her.

332
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,960
What's with that voice of yours?

333
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,260
You sounded better before!

334
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,860
We can't do anything about it so you sing for the next live, Tadako!

335
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,360
Akane, don't sing!

336
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
She had the nerve to say that.

337
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,260
It's too cruel!

338
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,160
That Hagie didn't have the slightest idea how Akane felt!

339
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,060
A few days after that,

340
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,760
Akane jumped in front of a car and committed suicide.

341
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,160
That's why I'm avenging Akane's death for her.

342
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,460
No, it wasn't suicide. It was an accident.

343
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,060
It was suicide, she killed herself!

344
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,960
Otherwise, Akane would've never ignored the traffic light.

345
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Wrong, Rumi.

346
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,960
Some boy was the one who ignored the traffic light

347
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,860
and ran into the street.

348
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,860
Akane got run over trying to save that boy.

349
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,460
What? That's a lie.

350
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,360
I know that's a lie.

351
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,960
Because Hagie said at Akane's funeral

352
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,860
that it was her fault that Akane died.

353
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,360
That's probably because Akane obeyed what Hagie had told her.

354
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,460
Obeyed what she was told?

355
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,560
Don't use your voice until it recovers!

356
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,060
That amount of hoarseness can be cured

357
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,060
and you'll get your nice voice back again.

358
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
She also apologized for saying what she shouldn't have

359
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,860
when she was drunk.

360
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,460
The people who witnessed the accident

361
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,860
said she jumped into traffic to save the boy

362
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,060
instead of calling out to him.

363
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,360
You didn't know about this

364
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,460
because after Akane died, you were sick in bed from the shock.

365
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,360
Oh, no!

366
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,660
What shall I do?

367
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,960
I killed Hagie.

368
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,660
No! No!

369
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,460
A scream of regret echoed throughout the rental studio.

370
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,460
Until the voice of the killer went hoarse.

371
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,460
No, you mean that keyboardist was the killer?

372
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah.

373
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,460
But, you're really something, Sera!

374
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,860
Because you solved a case again!

375
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,460
Oh, yeah?

376
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,760
Well, since Amuro and Conan helped me, it was no big deal!

377
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,160
Just as would be expected of a high school girl detective.

378
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,360
Well, my brother influenced me to becoming a detective!

379
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,960
You mean your smart brother that you mentioned

380
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,760
during the Red Woman case?

381
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,360
No, that's my brother in the middle!

382
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,260
The one who influenced me is my oldest brother!

383
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,860
I thought your oldest brother passed away?

384
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,660
Don't tell me he was a cop and died on duty?

385
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,960
But, he didn't work for the Japanese Police.

387
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,260
He worked in the States as an FBI agent!

388
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,760
Really?

389
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,060
It seems he had a tough time getting his green card.

390
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,960
That's why your big brother was in the States.

391
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Yeah.

392
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,360
Your brother's name is...

393
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,660
Shuichi Akai!

394
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,160
Awesome, don't you think?

395
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,460
I thought so.

396
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,760
But, you saw him on the platform of a station in Japan, right?

397
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,860
Yeah, that's why I was surprised.

398
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,060
Which means that maybe the guy who taught you how to play the bass

399
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,960
was also an FBI agent?

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,260
No way.

401
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,460
He was probably a friend my brother met while he was on vacation.

402
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,660
No, he was...

403
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,060
a MPD security police undercover agent.

404
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,160
A man your older brother, Shuichi Akai,

405
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,360
killed.

406
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,860
It's full of hot air balloons.

407
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,960
Watch out! They'll crash!

408
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,660
It may have been an accident but a person died.

409
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,960
You could be accused of Corporate Manslaughter.

410
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,460
No.

411
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,460
This is...

412
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,560
This could be...

413
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,460
Next Conan, "Mystery in a Hot Air Balloon"
