1
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,824
A case where building blocks are the clues.

2
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:24,424
Heiji's and Sleeping Kogoro's deductions conflict!

3
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,524
Which one will win?

4
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,024
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,725
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:57,982
Here's your Detective Samonji, File. 44.

8
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:00,883
"Testament With the Devil's Trap, Part 2".

9
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:03,882
This is it.

10
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:07,882
I knew you wanted it so bad, so I kept one for you.

11
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:10,182
Really?

12
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,783
Thank you so much, sir!

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,883
I've been waiting this for so long.

14
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:23,082
All right! I have to eat supper real quick

15
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,582
so I can finish the book before going to bed.

16
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,982
And tomorrow morning, I'm going to read it all over again.

17
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,483
I can't wait! I just can't wait.

18
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,682
I'm back!

19
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:37,383
Welcome home...

20
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:47,082
"The Deduction Battle (Part 1)"

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,583
Welcome home...

22
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,482
All right! The kid is back.

23
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,982
Let's go out and eat at a fancy restaurant, right?

24
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:59,682
Sure. It's kind of early,

25
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:02,582
so I guess we could go a little farther than usual.

26
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,782
Hey, kid. How about it?

27
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,382
What do you want to eat?

28
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,382
-I'll pass! -Pass?

29
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:11,182
Pasta? You mean Italian food.

30
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,282
I remember!

31
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:15,682
I heard there's a new fancy Italian restaurant in Haido Town.

32
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,382
All right. Let's go there.

33
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,882
Right. It's not so far from here, too.

34
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:23,083
All right. Let's go.

35
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,182
Man, that was good.

36
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:32,882
It's nice to have real spaghetti once in a while.

37
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,082
Right! We made the right choice, didn't we?

38
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,382
Yes! It was fantastic.

39
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,083
So why are you guys here, Kazuha and...

40
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:46,082
this dark-skinned guy.

41
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,082
Hey! What was that? What the heck was that?

42
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,082
Well, you came here without telling me anything beforehand.

43
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,082
I've got a schedule, too.

44
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,482
Right, speaking of schedule,

45
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,782
that's the reason why we came here!

46
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:02,482
We wanted to ask you about your schedule.

47
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:03,982
Schedule?

48
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:07,782
Yes. We want you guys to come to Osaka again.

49
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:11,182
There are many nice places that we haven't shown you yet.

50
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,582
What do you mean by nice places?

51
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,382
Of course.

52
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,182
It's the symbol of Osaka.

53
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,982
-Koshien Stadium. -Takarazuka Revue.

54
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,182
Koshien Stadium?

55
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,483
Takarazuka Revue?

56
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,282
Those are not in Osaka.

57
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,982
Hey, what's this about Koshien Stadium?

58
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,582
We didn't talk about Takarazuka Revue either.

59
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,082
Have you forgot already?

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,482
I told you I was going to get the tickets

61
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,082
to the Takarazuka Revue from my neighbours.

62
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,382
Oh, right. I remember you said something like that.

63
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:45,982
All right, then why don't we go to both?

64
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,482
Okay! It's the final game of the high school baseball tournament

65
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,183
that I really want to watch with you guys.

66
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,282
Oh, no. We can't go to both.

67
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,082
Kazuha, what's wrong?

68
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,082
Hey, don't tell me you got the tickets from the five crazy ladies?

69
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,882
I did.

70
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:03,283
Who are those ladies?

71
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,982
They are enthusiastic fans of Takarazuka Revue.

72
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,182
They save their money throughout the year

73
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:15,482
and spend all of it for the Takarazuka shows during summer time.

74
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,482
I heard they go to every single show,

75
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,082
but there is one show that they all cannot go to.

76
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,382
Don't tell me that's the day of...

77
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,483
The final game of the high school baseball tournament?

78
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,582
Those ladies are working for the same company,

79
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,582
and their boss is a huge fan of high school baseball.

80
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,582
Every year, all the workers go and watch the final game of the tournament,

81
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,782
and that's why I got the Takarazuka tickets

82
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,782
for the show playing on the same day as the final game.

83
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,182
I see.

84
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:44,182
It doesn't matter whether the final gets postponed to another day or not.

85
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:47,882
It's still going to be the same day as the final game anyway.

86
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,682
Well, I feel sorry for you, Kazuha.

87
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,482
But I think you should forget it this time.

88
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,582
What?

89
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,582
Takarazuka Revue plays the same show many times a year.

90
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,182
But the final game of the high school baseball tournament

91
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,082
is just once and that's it.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,982
I can't miss it.

93
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,482
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,682
Those baseball games are on the sports news and stuff.

95
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:06,582
You can watch them many times.

96
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,583
Stupid.

97
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,982
You have to watch it live!

98
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:11,482
Who in the world likes to watch only the result of the games on TV?

99
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:15,482
But I have to watch the Takarazuka show live, too!

100
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,882
They are amazing seats.

101
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:21,182
You'll never get seats like these again if you miss this opportunity.

102
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,582
Hey, Ran. You want to watch the Takarazuka show, right?

103
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,382
Yes.

104
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:29,582
Hey, kid. You're a man. You love baseball, right?

105
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,682
Of course.

106
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,782
Then what about you, Mr. Mouri?

107
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,582
Let me see.

108
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,682
Well, I love the seriousness and excitement of baseball games!

109
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:40,882
But at the same time,

110
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,782
I love the beauty and gorgeousness of the Takarazuka shows, too.

111
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,382
-Make up your mind. -Make up your mind.

112
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,782
Okay, how about this?

113
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:52,782
Whoever wins a deduction battle gets to see what he or she wants.

114
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:54,082
Deduction...

115
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,582
Battle?

116
00:06:55,583 --> 00:07:00,482
At the end of last month, there was a murder in the office of a company.

117
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,482
This murder case needs further investigation,

118
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:06,482
so Inspector Megure has asked me for help on it.

119
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,382
That company is actually in this area

120
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:12,982
and I was thinking about going there after dinner.

121
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:16,282
Although it's unethical to treat a murder case like this,

122
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:18,682
I thought you guys could come and help us.

123
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:22,383
It's not so bad because we are helping to solve the murder case, right?

124
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:26,782
All right. So Kazuha, you and I are going to fight.

125
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,382
That's not fair.

126
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:31,782
There's no way I can beat you in a deduction battle.

127
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:32,783
Of course.

128
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:38,382
I, the Sleeping Kogoro will be on your side, Kazuha. You can rely on me.

129
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:41,682
Seriously? Thanks a lot, man!

130
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:46,383
Well, Sleeping Kogoro always stands up for the weak.

131
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,482
I know what's really in your mind, old man.

132
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,582
Ran. I need your help, too.

133
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,782
Sure! Why not?

134
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:58,382
Let's beat them and watch the Takarazuka show!

135
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:01,883
You dummy rat. You got two people on your side.

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,882
Well, what can I say?

137
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,382
I guess I have to take this little kid with me.

138
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:12,282
You are the dummy rat, Heiji.

139
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,382
Hey, Mouri.

140
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,182
Thanks for coming.

141
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,482
No problem.

142
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:18,483
Let's go inside.

143
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,082
Stop blocking the way.

144
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,482
Heiji?

145
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,882
Hey, you. You're not allowed at the murder scene.

146
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:25,982
Don't worry about it.

147
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:29,782
The forensic officers are done searching the murder scene, right?

148
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:31,983
Well, yes.

149
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,782
The victim is the owner of a toy production company,

150
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,782
Kenji Tsujiya, 53 years old.

151
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:43,682
He worked and also lived here.

152
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:48,682
The estimated time of death was the 29th of last month, Sunday, around 5pm.

153
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:54,282
The dead body was found on the 30th, Monday, around 10am.

154
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,882
Who found it?

155
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:59,282
Four workers in this company found it.

156
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:01,382
Four workers.

157
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:05,682
These four workers always come a little early in the morning,

158
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:08,282
and eat breakfast in a coffee house down there,

159
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,582
then come to the office together.

160
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,382
I see. That's why it's four people.

161
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,982
And these four workers found their boss,

162
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:21,482
who was tied with a rope and beaten to death with a golf club.

163
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,882
How do you know that, Heiji?

164
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:26,982
You see the ink spot around the victim's back?

165
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,983
Yes.

166
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:33,582
Perhaps the ink spilled over when they were fighting.

167
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,082
But the murderer didn't care and just tied the owner up with a rope.

168
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:41,882
I saw the marks of the rope all over the floor.

169
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:44,883
So I thought he was wriggling on the floor with his hands tied behind him.

170
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,682
Okay, but what about him being beaten with a golf club?

171
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:52,082
I saw the blood on his head.

172
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:57,682
And also, see the thin marks on the floor near his head?

173
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:00,582
These are from iron clubs.

174
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,882
The murderer missed the head and hit the floor

175
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,582
when he or she was beating the owner who was lying on the floor.

176
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,282
But why did the murderer tied him up first, and then clubbed him?

177
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:12,282
Maybe the murderer wanted the combination of the safe.

178
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:17,482
See? The door of the safe is left wide open.

179
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,682
I see.

180
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:21,182
Some outsider committed the murder for the money, is that it?

181
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:24,182
I don't know whether it was an outsider or not.

182
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:25,582
But it's certain that the murderer tied the president up first

183
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,782
in order to get the combination out of him.

184
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:30,082
And then, the murderer clubbed him to death

185
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:34,083
because the president saw his or her face.

186
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:38,282
Something like that. Right, Inspector?

187
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:40,582
Right.

188
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,982
Hey, are you going to be all right, Dad?

189
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,382
The boys are dominating this deduction battle.

190
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,782
Are they?

191
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:48,182
Well, it's not a hard thing to do.

192
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:51,282
With this murder scene, even a policeman can make a deduction like this.

193
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,882
-Even a policeman... -Hey.

194
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:57,582
This isn't everything, right? There must be something else.

195
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,183
Come on. Let it out.

196
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:01,983
All right.

197
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,582
We found these on the floor around the victim's dead body.

198
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,883
These four building blocks.

199
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,983
But there are other building blocks near the victim's dead body.

200
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,182
Actually, we found the victim's fingerprints

201
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:23,482
and also ink on those four blocks.

202
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,882
Ink?

203
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:29,283
If you look at the ink-spotted side of each building block...

204
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,283
And this is the last one.

205
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:46,083
-Toy? -Toy?

206
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,827
Toy?

207
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:01,327
No. Is it rice cake store?

208
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,828
I think it's rice cake store, don't you think?

209
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,127
Right.

210
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:07,327
If it really means "omocha",

211
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,827
then whoever made this could've picked the other block to spell it right.

212
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,127
Inspector.

213
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:16,027
Can you tell me specifically where the four blocks in the pictures were?

214
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,227
Sure.

215
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:20,527
This is how it looked when we found the dead body.

216
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,927
I guess this guy is the...

217
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:25,227
Yes, he's the victim.

218
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,927
The president of this toy production company, Mr. Tsujiya.

219
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:34,027
From the stack of the building blocks by the victim's dead body,

220
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:37,327
we found the four blocks with characters "o", "mo", "chi", and "ya".

221
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:40,928
Each of them had the victim's fingerprints and an ink spot on it.

222
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,427
The ink spots on the blocks

223
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:50,628
and the one that's on the victim's back came from the same bottle.

224
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:56,127
The problem is, who put the ink spots on those four building blocks?

225
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,128
Right.

226
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:01,027
We found the victim's fingerprints on those blocks,

227
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,227
but it could be that the murderer made the president hold them

228
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,327
to hide something.

229
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,827
Hey.

230
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:12,227
These are really the only ones that have the owner's fingerprints?

231
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:17,427
Actually the fingerprints are on some other blocks.

232
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:21,827
But we found that these four blocks have fingerprints all over them.

233
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:23,627
I mean on every single side.

234
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:27,327
Even on those characters.

235
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:31,027
So I guess it's possible to think that those four blocks

236
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:35,527
are the owner's dying message.

237
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,127
What? What makes you think that?

238
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,328
Look closely at the picture of the murder scene.

239
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:45,627
His hands are tied behind his back, right?

240
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:51,127
You can hardly see and touch anything if your hands are tied like this.

241
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:54,627
His fingerprints were on every single side of the four blocks

242
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:59,127
because the victim was searching for the correct blocks.

243
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:02,027
He touched some other blocks,

244
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:04,027
but not so many fingerprints were found from them.

245
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:08,727
That's because each block is designed to have five characters in the order.

246
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,027
So it's not so hard to find which one's which.

247
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:12,627
I see.

248
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:16,627
That's why we found so many fingerprints particularly on the four blocks.

249
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:20,427
In fact, fingerprints are made of sweat and skin oil

250
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:21,827
and that's why they remain on things.

251
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,227
But once people die, these things stop coming out.

252
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:29,027
So even if you try to leave fingerprints of a dead body,

253
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,828
you can only get one or two solid ones.

254
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:36,427
Perhaps when the murderer wasn't looking,

255
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:40,627
the victim took the four blocks with his hands tied behind his back.

256
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:44,127
Then, rolled his body and put the ink on those blocks.

257
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:49,827
And, he rolled his body back again to put them back to where they were.

258
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:54,227
I'm sure his hands were full of sweat because of fear of death.

259
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:59,527
As a matter of fact, the marks of the rope all over the floor prove that.

260
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,027
So it's possible to think

261
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:06,727
that the feeling of danger actually made the owner choose the wrong block.

262
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,927
This is a toy production company.

263
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:11,027
Logically, the dying message must be toys

264
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:14,327
rather than rice cake store, don't you think?

265
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:16,927
Oh, my God. We just got here.

266
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:19,027
How could you come up with so many things in such a short while?

267
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,728
Yeah, I know. That's my boy.

268
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:25,627
This isn't good, Ran.

269
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:28,127
He's dominating us mentally.

270
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,727
This is a battle between Heiji and us!

271
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:33,128
It's either the baseball game or Takarazuka show.

272
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,827
To win this deduction battle,

273
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:41,227
we have to find out what the dying message really meant first.

274
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:45,127
Maybe there are some hints in the other toys.

275
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:48,227
No, we found no strange toys other than the blocks.

276
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,327
-Are you sure? -Yes.

277
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:54,927
We checked every single toy in this office

278
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,528
looking for some other dying messages that could be hiding.

279
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,827
Then, maybe the dying message has a different meaning.

280
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,627
What do you mean?

281
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:09,127
Different combinations of four of the characters, you mean?

282
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:12,127
Omoyachi, ochimoya, ochiyamo...

283
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,627
Oyamochi, oyachimo, mochiyao...

284
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,727
It doesn't make sense at all.

285
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:18,428
All right, what else have we got?

286
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:30,227
We found only a golf club and a leather coat with the victim's blood on it,

287
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:33,228
which we assume the murderer was wearing during the murder.

288
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:40,227
But the golf club and the leather coat are the victim's belongings.

289
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,427
So they didn't help us determine who killed him.

290
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:48,627
What's more confusing is that the murderer was wearing that leather coat.

291
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:52,227
The bloodstain. It's faded only around the left shoulder.

292
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,327
It's got rubbed against something.

293
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:57,127
Actually, that's another mystery.

294
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,327
We searched throughout this office,

295
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:03,527
but found no spots where the bloodstain got rubbed against.

296
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,627
The murderer may have touched it when he or she took it off.

297
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:09,627
You haven't found gloves or something like that, right?

298
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,927
Hey.

299
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,527
Speaking of blood,

300
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:15,927
there's a strange bloodstain right here.

301
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,828
-Where is it? -Right here.

302
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:20,827
Why'd you crawl under there?

303
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:22,428
-This is it. -Hold on a sec.

304
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:25,427
You have to look at it really close.

305
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:28,327
You see the part where the bloodstain ends unnaturally?

306
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:31,227
Maybe something was here, don't you think?

307
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:34,728
Could be. What kind of thing would you put here though?

308
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,527
Where is the remote?

309
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,027
Hey! Don't touch them.

310
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,928
We have to keep the desk just like the way it is.

311
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,427
It's external input only.

312
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:59,727
So then, maybe a video camera was here until the victim was murdered.

313
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:03,327
The video camera was in the president's room.

314
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,027
Okay, then. Call the forensic officer

315
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,827
to check if there's any blood on it, will you?

316
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,427
It's strange.

317
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,027
Let's assume that the video camera was here.

318
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:15,427
But why would the murderer move it after killing the owner?

319
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,127
The murderer connected the video camera to the TV

320
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:20,827
just to watch the president after tying him up?

321
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:23,528
Then why did he remove it? The owner was dead.

322
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,428
Also...

323
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,528
Something's been bugging me ever since I got here.

324
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,727
Right here, in this office.

325
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:37,827
There's something odd, something unnatural.

326
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:40,327
Hey, Conan.

327
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,527
What's up, Ran?

328
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:45,427
Could you do me a favour?

329
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:50,227
I really want Kazuha to win this deduction battle.

330
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:55,627
I think she is really looking forward to see the Takarazuka show with us.

331
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:58,027
So, next time you come up with a good idea or something,

332
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,327
I want you to tell us quietly.

333
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,627
I'll give Dad your ideas

334
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:06,627
and Sleeping Kogoro will take care of the rest like always.

335
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:08,728
Yes? Please?

336
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,828
Please?

337
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:16,627
Conan, please?

338
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:17,928
Hey...

339
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:23,327
This kid is mine.

340
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,828
So stop headhunting him, will you?

341
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:35,027
Of course you respect a guy's friendship more than one with girls, right?

342
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:36,527
Friendship?

343
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:39,028
I'm on your side only because you gave me no choice.

344
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:41,528
Doesn't matter!

345
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,527
We have to win this the battle anyway. We have to watch the final game!

346
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,528
Oh, what a guy.

347
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:51,327
How was the identification?

348
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:52,328
We found it.

349
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,627
We found the victim's blood even though it was very slight.

350
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:56,227
I guess the murderer did not realize it.

351
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,427
But why was the video camera here anyway?

352
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,427
Perhaps the murderer connected the camera to the TV

353
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:05,827
and watched the owner until he spit out the combination to the safe.

354
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:09,527
But why do something round about like that?

355
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:12,427
Why not just tie him up and wait in front of the safe

356
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,227
until he spits out the combination?

357
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:18,827
He left the video camera on, to keep him from moving around

358
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:22,128
because he was ransacking the other rooms.

359
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:28,227
The murderer didn't know the victim left a dying message.

360
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,527
Well now, it is more likely that the murderer is well acquainted

361
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:36,927
with this office and also with the victim.

362
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:39,727
The president left a dying message.

363
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:43,927
If we get it right, it's possible to find out who the murder is.

364
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:47,927
Then, we should investigate the four workers who found the dead body.

365
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:50,527
Takagi is asking them about their alibi right now.

366
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:51,528
Inspector Megure.

367
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:55,827
I just finished the interrogation.

368
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:57,828
And how was it?

369
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:02,427
They are all designers

370
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,927
but also do some other types of work, like Nao Aiko, who does accounting.

371
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:08,827
June 29th around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

372
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,227
she was out fishing alone.

373
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:16,027
Atushi Hasami, the salesperson, was watching a movie at home.

374
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:19,927
Isao Nakagami, the planner, was at the turf.

375
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,227
Hajime Iwatomi, the vice president,

376
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:26,127
was out watching the final round of a golf tournament.

377
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,727
Those are all very vague alibis.

378
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:32,627
Yes. Right now, Chiba is verifying their stories

379
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,327
and if there is anything hiding behind the stories.

380
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:36,327
It seems nobody is able to prove their alibi. Not even one.

381
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,927
Hiding...

382
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:38,928
Behind...

383
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:43,727
Wait a minute. If the situation was...

384
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:46,228
That dying message on the four blocks is...

385
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:57,727
It was so easy.

386
00:21:57,728 --> 00:22:00,428
How come I didn't realize this?

387
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,527
Kazuha, I'm sorry.

388
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:07,028
This battle is mine.

389
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:29,728
Kazuha?

390
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,627
"Next Episode."

391
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:03,227
Now all we need is that thing.

392
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:05,428
The thing that connects the pieces of the mystery all together.

393
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,727
Kazuha?

394
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:10,127
Sorry, Ran. I can't talk right now.

395
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:11,928
I think I'm just about to solve it.

396
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:14,728
Kudo.

397
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,528
I got it.

398
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,427
This must be it.

399
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:22,427
The murderer is...

400
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:28,428
Next Conan, "The Deduction Battle (Part 2)"

401
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,427
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:48,727
"Calendar."

403
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:49,927
The battle finally ends in the next episode!

404
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:51,727
Kazuha or Heiji?

405
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,428
-Who do you think is going to win? -Who do you think is going to win?
