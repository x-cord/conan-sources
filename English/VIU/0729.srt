1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,970
I won't be able to see you anymore.

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,970
Please take care of yourself.

3
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,870
"Fin"

4
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,370
Oh, my...

5
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,970
It's really touching no matter how many times I watch it.

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,370
Thank you for watching.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,070
"Misuzu Shirakawa (58)" -It's an old movie,

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,970
"Actress" -but I hope young girls like you enjoyed it too.

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,670
Yes, of course!

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,770
It was really enjoyable.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,970
Mother,

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,970
"Kyosuke Shirakawa (23)" -why not show them the room upstairs too?

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,370
"Misuzu's son" -The odds and ends that she used in the movies

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,970
are decorated there.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,770
Oh! I'd sure like to take a look.

16
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,970
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,870
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,670
A fire breaks out a movie star's residence.

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,870
The surprising truth that is hidden behind the artwork.

20
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,370
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,870
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:05,363
"A Diamond, Artwork and a Great Actress"

24
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:09,663
All such nostalgic movies.

25
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:13,363
This is a mini Misuzu Shirakawa Museum, isn't it?

26
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,963
How embarrassing.

27
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,563
These are things that my late husband has collected.

28
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,163
I see.

29
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,963
This is the room where the costume that she used to wear

30
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:23,163
and the odds and ends that had been used are.

31
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,863
It's fantastic.

32
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,963
This is mother's bedroom.

33
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,563
Memorable things and valuables are in this glass case.

34
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,763
Is this genuine?

35
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,363
Of course!

36
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:48,563
Mrs. Shirakawa would never decorate fake things!

37
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,563
Is that genuine too?

38
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,863
"Chiharu Shirakawa (22), Misuzu's daughter" -It's genuine.

39
00:03:56,863 --> 00:04:01,463
I felt sorry keeping it in the glass case right through.

40
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:05,563
It's a drawing that was used when I filmed "Holiday at Rokumeikan."

41
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:08,463
But, there was no necklace in the drawing when it was finished.

42
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,363
So I thought...

43
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:11,463
I see.

44
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,163
Hey, Dad.

45
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,863
Watch out!

46
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:18,163
I know.

47
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,063
What is he doing?

48
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,063
Hey, Mother!

49
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,563
What's the meaning of this?

50
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,463
What's all the commotion about?

51
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:33,463
"Saori Shirakawa (21)" -Why did you cancel my passing the audition?

52
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,963
Please calm down, Saori.

53
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,063
I heard about it from the producer.

54
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,463
That you called

55
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:42,463
and canceled my passing the audition.

56
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:43,863
Audition?

57
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,663
Saori auditioned for a certain movie.

58
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,463
That's because you're not a good singer

59
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,063
and your acting is not good either.

60
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,463
I'm too ashamed to have you perform in public.

61
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:55,663
Mother.

62
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,363
Stop deciding things on your own!

63
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,963
Enough!

64
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:03,063
I'm not going to let you throw dirt on my name!

65
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:06,063
You were an actress long time ago!

66
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:09,963
Nobody remembers an actress called Misuzu Shirakawa anymore!

67
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:10,963
Saori!

68
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,263
Let her be!

69
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,463
Okay, let's have lunch.

70
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:19,563
Yuka, please show everyone to the terrace.

71
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:20,863
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,763
-Conan, what're you doing? -Okay.

73
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:40,063
How would you like some jam?

74
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,963
Thank you.

75
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:44,263
I'm sorry about what just happened.

76
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:47,963
Mother is strict when it comes to acting.

77
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:49,263
No.

78
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,563
Mother is living in dreamland.

79
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,963
In a land where she used to be a great actress.

80
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:59,263
That's not nice, Kyosuke.

81
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:05,363
I'm sorry about what happened a while ago.

82
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:07,863
It's so embarrassing.

83
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:10,963
No, don't worry about it.

84
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:13,263
Well, no matter how old they get,

85
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:15,663
children are children, you see.

86
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:16,663
Like they say,

87
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:19,263
"No child knows how dear he is to his parents".

88
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,363
Yuka!

89
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,663
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,663
"Yuka Nakanishi (22)" -This is not the usual rose jam, is it?

91
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,863
"Maid" -I'm sorry, when I looked yesterday,

92
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:37,163
I thought I had two more bottles, but...

93
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,063
Go buy some right this minute!

94
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,463
You don't have to get all worked up over a bottle of jam, Mother.

95
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:46,863
Nobody used to forget my favorite at the film studio.

96
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:49,763
-That was before, Mother. -What...

97
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,563
I'm sorry. I'll go pick some up right away.

98
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:00,463
Kyosuke.

99
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:03,263
It's a bit early but I'll drink my medicine.

100
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,963
Please get it ready.

101
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,163
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:08,463
Then, Mr. Mouri, if you will excuse me,

103
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,163
I'll see you later.

104
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,563
I'm sorry for all this.

105
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:16,863
No, don't be.

106
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:19,663
That's right, if you will excuse me,

107
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:21,663
I'll go check on Yuka.

108
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:22,963
Please do.

109
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,963
What's with this house anyway?

110
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:35,763
I'm sorry for all the commotion.

111
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:36,963
Not at all.

112
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:39,663
Where's Chiharu?

113
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,063
She went to check on Yuka.

114
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,663
I see.

115
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,863
Is Misuzu sick or something?

116
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,463
She's going to take an afternoon nap.

117
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,063
Afternoon nap?

118
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,463
Yes. She takes an afternoon nap between the hours of 02:00 pm

119
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:57,563
and 04:00 pm every day.

120
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,163
That's her daily routine.

121
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:01,563
She goes as far as to drink sleeping pills to do so.

122
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,163
She says she does it to maintain her health and beauty.

123
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,563
Yuka, are you all right?

124
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:28,963
What happened?

125
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,763
I'm to blame.

126
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,363
I wasn't looking straight.

127
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:35,363
I'm sorry, I got out of sorts...

128
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:38,663
Oh, no. You really went all out.

129
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,163
I was watching.

130
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,163
Chiharu staggered in front of the road

131
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:47,063
and Yuka who tried to avoid her landed in the pond.

132
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,563
It's not Yuka's fault.

133
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,763
You people!

134
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:54,163
What's all the commotion?

135
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,663
Hey, that car?

136
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:59,163
Please forgive me, I was careless.

137
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,363
No! I...

138
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,763
Never mind!

139
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:07,763
Yuka, pack your bags and leave as of today!

140
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,263
I don't believe this.

141
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:12,563
The first thing you'd ask is if the person's okay or not, right?

142
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:15,363
The car can be fixed with insurance!

143
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,163
Enough is enough!

144
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:19,963
Why are you always so selfish like that?

145
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:23,463
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

146
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,963
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

147
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:30,163
I'm tired. I'm going to rest.

148
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:35,763
Don't worry, Yuka.

149
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:38,763
We'll persuade her later.

150
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:41,063
Then, Mr. Mouri, please help us.

151
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:54,063
Mr. Mouri, thank you so much.

152
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,663
No, no need to thank me.

153
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,463
All Dad this was press on the gas.

154
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,163
Doesn't it smell like something is burning?

155
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,563
-Madam's room is... -Mother!

156
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:11,663
Mother!

157
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,063
Misuzu!

158
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:24,463
-Misuzu! -Mother!

159
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:27,063
Kyosuke, hold that side.

160
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:28,163
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,763
This is?

162
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,363
Today at around 02:00 pm,

163
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,063
there was a fire at the residence of actress Misuzu Shirakawa,

164
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,263
and Mrs. Shirakawa passed away.

165
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:47,763
"Police Detective Tamagawa" -Mr. Mouri, when you entered the room,

166
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,363
was Mrs. Shirakawa already...

167
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,563
Yes.

168
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,663
It seems that she drank some sleeping pills before taking a nap

169
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,463
so I guess she inhaled a lot of smoke

170
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:58,463
without being aware of the fire.

171
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,763
I see.

172
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:03,763
But, the fire seems to have ignited from a strange place.

173
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,963
True.

174
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,763
Did your Mother smoke cigarettes?

175
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:07,863
No.

176
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,163
Not only Mother,

177
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,963
but no one smokes cigarettes in this house.

178
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,163
This is?

179
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:19,863
Maybe...

180
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,563
I get the picture.

181
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:28,363
Which means that this is a homicide.

182
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,363
Moreover, the perp is...

183
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,464
The perp is that person!

184
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,619
So...

185
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,419
It's already sundown

186
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,919
and hard to conclude if this is a homicide or an accident,

187
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,019
so we'll return to the station

188
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:49,519
and wait for the results from forensics...

189
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,019
Please wait, Officer Tamagawa!

190
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,319
Any problem?

191
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,319
Well, no...

192
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,519
Dad?

193
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,519
Mr. Mouri?

194
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,419
Don't tell me that this is the Sleeping Kogoro?

195
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,419
What?

196
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,419
Everyone.

197
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,419
The fire was set off deliberately

198
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,419
to kill Mrs Misuzu Shirakawa.

199
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:16,119
Are you saying that this is a homicide?

200
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,519
Exactly.

201
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,219
Moreover, the perp is here!

202
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:27,019
But, Dad, back them all of us were near the pond.

203
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,719
Yeah. It's probably a type of fire

204
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,919
caused because of concentrated sunlight to a specific area.

205
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,619
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight?

206
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,919
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight is fire

207
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,219
that is set off by things like water from a PET bottle

208
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:41,619
serving the role of a convex lens.

209
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,819
In other words, Mr. Mouri...

210
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,719
are you saying that the sunlight was concentrated on the surface

211
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,819
of that portrait and was ignited?

212
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,319
But, this room is located on the north side

213
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,719
and sunlight doesn't come in.

214
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,819
Please look out the window.

215
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,219
That glass building which looks

216
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:02,419
to have been diagonally cut off with a knife.

217
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:06,119
Doesn't it remind you of something when you look at it, Kyosuke?

218
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,619
That's right.

219
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,419
It's true that when I ran into this room.

220
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:18,019
But even if the sunlight were to have reflected on that building,

221
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,219
it would only hit the wall on the opposite side...

222
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,519
The mirror.

223
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,719
No.

224
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,419
Even if it reflected off this mirror,

225
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,019
I still think the light wouldn't hit the portrait.

226
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,119
It's true that there seems to be some difficulty here.

227
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,719
Then, let's confirm it.

228
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,719
Like this?

229
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,419
A little more upwards.

230
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:44,719
About here?

231
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,719
Okay.

232
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,719
Please turn on the switch then.

233
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,319
Just as I thought...

234
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:57,419
The light has gone to the wall opposite the portrait.

235
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,619
Then, Yuka please replace the mirror that is on the floor

236
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,719
to its original position.

237
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,819
Yes, sir.

238
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:08,219
It probably fell during the commotion of extinguishing the fire.

239
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:11,519
Can you see the mark on the stand?

240
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,719
Yes, here it is!

241
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,219
There's one on the glass case too,

242
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,919
so can you match it and line it up?

243
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,919
Yes.

244
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,319
Please match the vertical angle too.

245
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,519
Yes, sir.

246
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,119
The light hit the portrait!

247
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:34,819
Please do the same with the other two too.

248
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,419
In other words, this is what it is.

249
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,219
The light that reflected off the glass building,

250
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,319
went through the window

251
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,419
and reflected on the full length mirror.

252
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,619
On top of that it also reflected

253
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,819
on the three mirrors on top of the glass case.

254
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:00,019
Then, it concentrated on one point of the portrait.

255
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,219
The perp probably set the position of the mirrors

256
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,619
meticulously in place beforehand.

257
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,219
But, please try remembering.

258
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,719
When I was shown here before noon

259
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,919
I mistakenly knocked over the mirror.

260
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,319
Which means that it was highly likely that the position of the mirror

261
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,819
may have been displaced from where the perp had placed it.

262
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,719
Despite this, the fire burst out just as

263
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,119
the perp had planned.

264
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,219
Which means...

265
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,519
The perp returned the position of the mirrors in the right place?

266
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,019
Yes. Moreover, there's only one person who could've done it.

267
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,319
The person who remained back in this room

268
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,419
when all of us went out to the terrace,

269
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,219
Ms. Chiharu Shirakawa!

270
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,119
You're the only one!

271
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,419
No.

272
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,219
No way.

273
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:51,819
Is that true, Chiharu?

274
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,219
Did you kill...

275
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,919
No! Wait a second.

276
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,819
My Mother opened the window for just two or three minutes.

277
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,819
Can something be ignited in such a short time?

278
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,819
Yes, you can.

279
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,319
Chiharu,

280
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,419
after you repositioned the mirrors,

281
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:15,519
you applied a combustible solution most probably something

282
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,319
like a thinner that is used when oil painting.

283
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,519
A thinner?

284
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,719
Yes.

285
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:24,319
In volatile solvents such as turpentine and petrol,

286
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,119
there are those that have flash points below 50буC.

287
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,519
You're the one who hid the rose jam too, aren't you?

288
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,419
Just as expected,

289
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,619
Misuzu sent Yuka off to buy a new bottle of jam.

290
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,719
Then, you jumped in front of Yuka's car.

291
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,019
You people!

292
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,319
What's the commotion about?

293
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,019
Hey, that car?

294
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,919
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

295
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,019
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

296
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,819
Is it true? Chiharu?

297
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,619
Is it true, sis?

298
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,419
Did you kill Mother, Chiharu?

299
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,419
Where's the proof?

300
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,719
If you're going as far as to say so, Mr. Mouri,

301
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,119
please show me what proof you have.

302
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
The proof.

303
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,119
Yes.

304
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,819
What we've heard till now are all assumptions.

305
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,519
Just because I was the last one to leave the room,

306
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,219
does that serve as proof that I changed the position of the mirror?

307
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,319
Ridiculous.

308
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,819
Yuka?

309
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:37,819
Yes?

310
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,819
A lily was decorated in this room, wasn't it?

311
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,219
Yes, because Madam used to like it.

312
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,319
How about in the other rooms?

313
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,319
No.

314
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,019
This is the only room that a lily was decorated in.

315
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:56,019
Mr. Mouri, just what are you getting at?

316
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:58,619
Of course about proof.

317
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,019
In other words,

318
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,719
I'm talking about the pollen of the lily

319
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:07,019
that's attached to the outer part of your right sleeve.

320
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,219
What proof will this serve as?

321
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,619
Why would the pollen of the lily that is only decorated in this room

322
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:24,919
be attached to your right sleeve?

323
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,919
It's probably because I touched the lily accidently at some point, no?

324
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,919
-Just because of that you can't... -Accidentally at what point?

325
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,219
I don't remember!

326
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,419
Please carefully try to remember.

327
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:41,619
The lily was decorated in the vase on top of the glass case.

328
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:45,119
If the pollen got attached to your right sleeve,

329
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,819
it means that you reached over your right hand,

330
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,419
to the left of the lily, and did something.

331
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,819
Then what was there?

332
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,519
Right.

333
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,719
Over there was what was used in the experiment a while ago

334
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:06,119
to reflect and concentrate light, the mirrors!

335
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:11,819
Chiharu.

336
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:15,719
Chiharu, why? Why did you kill...

337
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,019
Miss Chiharu.

338
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,619
That woman, she kept calling me "Miss Chiharu"

339
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,619
for as long as I can remember.

340
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,619
You two were always called "Kyosuke" or "Saori", though.

341
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:29,619
Just because of something like that...

342
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,419
Mr. Mouri, my father brought me into this family.

343
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:37,219
When I heard that my Father was going to get married again

344
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:40,719
and she was to be his new wife, I was really happy.

345
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:44,319
After all, she was the actress of my dreams.

346
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,819
Therefore, I did anything I could to get her to like me.

347
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,119
I tried not to be selfish,

348
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,319
and did household chores of my own intiative.

349
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,119
But, all that came back from that woman was,

350
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,319
"Good work, Miss Chiharu",

351
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,319
"Thank you, Miss Chiharu",

352
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,319
"No, Miss Chiharu".

353
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,519
Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu...

354
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,119
It was just last week.

355
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,519
As for her, she has nothing to do with me.

356
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,719
It's okay, don't worry about it.

357
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,719
She's just a child of my husband's ex-wife.

358
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,519
Yes, that's right.

359
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,319
The only two children who are blood related with me,

360
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:30,119
Misuzu Shirakwa are Saori and Kyosuke.

361
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,119
I'm not going to give her a cent of inheritance either!

362
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,819
Miss Chiharu.

363
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,919
This is my personal opinion

364
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,719
but I think you tried too hard.

365
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,619
A parent child relationship

366
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,719
isn't something you should over work yourself over.

367
00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:00,419
I think you should've been more selfish and assert yourself.

368
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,019
I guess you started off pushing the wrong button.

369
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,219
"Mouri Detective Agency"

370
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,919
Hey, Dad!

371
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,119
You went to the horse races again, didn't you?

372
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,719
Idiot, no way.

373
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:51,119
Geez, and you ate curry there too, didn't you?

374
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,219
What're you going to do about dinner?

375
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:55,119
How'd you know?

376
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:59,919
It's on your shirt the curry stain.

377
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,619
Oh, well...

378
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,519
I admit that I ate curry.

379
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,019
-But, it's not that I ate it at the race track. -Pops.

380
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,719
Your ear, your ear.

381
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:18,919
Oh, my God. Why is this on my ear?

382
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,619
It's strange. Mysterious things do happen.

383
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,619
What a poor sport!

384
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,419
I'm cutting your allowance down 50 per cent!

385
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,019
Yikes! Please give me mercy my lady!

386
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,519
You're a detective so you should be observant of trivials.

387
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,419
One stab right through the chest.

388
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:47,519
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

389
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,719
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

390
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,619
I'll bet you two are the perps.

391
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:55,719
There's one thing in this room

392
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,919
of the same color that is from nature.

393
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,019
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

394
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,819
Over there!

395
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,419
Next Conan,

396
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,319
