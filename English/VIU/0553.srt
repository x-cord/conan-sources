"Beika Police Station Interrogation Room."

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,520
Togashi! Don't just sit there, say something!

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,620
Togashi.

4
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,020
Dad.

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,620
Today at 16:00...

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,220
This man, Fumitaka Togashi was scheduled to be sent

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,120
to the prosecutor as a suspect of murder.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,820
In other words, he was going to be taken to the police.

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,420
Everything happened yesterday.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,620
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,320
Pops is having a hard time

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,220
confronting the suspect in the interrogation room.

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,820
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,620
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,920
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"The Interrogation Room."

00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:54,668
"Yesterday noon at the Musashino prison."

19
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:03,168
-Okay, great! -It's my turn next.

20
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:09,556
Togashi!

21
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,756
Good work! Great how you hung in there!

22
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,156
Mr. Mouri!

23
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:19,656
Fumitaka Togashi is a murderer that Pops had arrested

24
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,256
when he was a police detective,

25
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:23,856
and today was the day that man came out of prison.

26
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,456
-Excuse me! -Throw it over this way, please.

27
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:31,956
Here!

28
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:36,056
-Thank you, sir! -Thank you!

29
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,456
Although it's not much, I've reserved a seat for you too.

30
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,256
Let's go and...

31
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,856
I'm sorry, if you will excuse me.

32
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:49,256
Huh?

33
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,756
Hey, Togashi!

34
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,656
Wait! Hakamada!

35
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:57,456
The incident occurred.

36
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:34,156
Last night at around 22:00,

37
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,156
Mr. Takehiko Sakuraba, age 55

38
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:37,856
who resides at 4-Beika-cho was murdered.

39
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:41,456
A convict, who was released on parole from the Musashino Prison yesterday,

40
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:44,056
who was under the supervision of parole officer, Mr. Sakuraba,

41
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:48,256
suspect Fumitaka Togashi, age 32 was arrested.

42
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:52,256
What? It can't be...

43
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:58,556
"Beika Police Station. Today at 10:05 a.m."

44
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,256
"Officer Norio Kasamatsu (52), Beika Police Station 1st Division."

45
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:06,256
It's no use keeping quiet, Togashi!

46
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,356
Detective Mouri is outside, too.

47
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,556
What?

48
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:17,256
I see. So, you arrested Togashi in the past.

49
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:18,456
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:22,756
He killed a man in a fight over something trivial.

51
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,456
And although his lawyer pleaded self-defense,

52
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,756
his attitude in court was rebellious,

53
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,656
and it turned out he had a previous police record.

54
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:32,856
Therefore, he was sentenced to a term of 13 years.

55
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,656
Nevertheless, he is a kind guy inside,

56
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,756
who thinks a lot of his mother.

57
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,156
After serving his term, his character completely reformed

58
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,856
and he became a model prisoner.

59
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,756
How can it be that he would kill again?

60
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:47,456
Moreover, on the night of the day that he's released on parole.

61
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,056
It's unbelievable!

62
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:52,156
I understand how you must feel, but...

63
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:54,856
What a softie.

64
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:59,056
It just goes to show that people don't change that easily.

65
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:00,656
So, Inspector.

66
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,156
We'll be go through the procedure of sending him

67
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,156
to the prosecutor as scheduled.

68
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:08,756
Please wait a while.

69
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:10,556
You're Mr. Mouri I believe.

70
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:12,956
I've heard a lot about you.

71
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,556
Well, regardless of who you were in the past,

72
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,156
right now you're just a private eye.

73
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:19,956
Outsiders don't have a say in this!

74
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:27,156
Officer Kasamatsu, process it immediately.

75
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:28,756
Yes, sir!

76
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,856
Inspector!

77
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,156
Only, he's to be sent to the prosecutor as scheduled at 16:00.

78
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:35,456
We'll take a break till then.

79
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:39,456
But Togashi is to be kept here at the interrogation room!

80
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:42,556
That's ridiculous!

81
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,256
You've got to be joking!

82
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:47,556
I'll talk to your superior about this.

83
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,356
Thank you so much, Inspector!

84
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:58,556
Sleeping Kogoro. We owe you a lot, you see.

85
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:02,556
I repeat, break time is till 16:00!

86
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,056
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:08,156
So, that's how Pops got special permission

88
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,256
to interrogate Togashi, but...

89
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,756
Togashi, don't just sit there, say something!

90
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:16,256
Togashi!

91
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,656
Dad...

92
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:26,156
The victim's wounds are concentrated on the right side of his body.

93
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,856
No, Conan, you shouldn't look without permission.

94
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,656
Does that mean that the culprit was holding

95
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,056
the murder weapon in his left hand?

96
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:36,456
Yeah. We also have an eye-witness report on that, too.

97
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,856
But he's not a lefty.

98
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:44,656
No, but there are several wounds on the left side too.

99
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:46,656
He probably switched the hands he was holding the murder weapon with,

100
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,756
several times when he was struggling with the culprit.

101
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:52,056
It's true. That's a possibility.

102
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,556
To make sure if it was really so...

103
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,656
Where's the men's room?

104
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:01,456
I don't want you to get lost, so I'll wait here.

105
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:03,256
Thank you.

106
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,356
Hello?

107
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,156
Mr. Mouri? Huh?

108
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,556
What about the interrogation?

109
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,056
I'm on break for lunch.

110
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,556
The thing is, Takagi. I'd like you to do me a favor.

111
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:23,456
Huh? Yes, sir!

112
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:26,456
Huh? Go to the site right now?

113
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,156
Yes, yes, all right!

114
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:32,056
And about Ran...

115
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,956
Dad says for me to go home?

116
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:37,656
He said that you don't have to worry.

117
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:40,356
It seems that Conan's going home too.

118
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,956
See you then, because I've got to run!

119
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,356
Wait!

120
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,056
Gee, everybody's so selfish!

121
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,856
Conan?

122
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:54,356
Pops says he forgot to tell you some things,

123
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,856
so he wants me to go along with you.

124
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:57,856
Huh? You mean Mr. Mouri?

125
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,556
Hurry! There's not much time

126
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,456
before he'll be taken to the prosecutor, is there?

127
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,156
Do you remember, Togashi?

128
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:09,656
After serving time, you wrote me letters for 6 months.

129
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:12,156
You wrote that you are reflecting on yourself

130
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:14,956
and repenting what you had done.

131
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,656
That you're going to become a new person

132
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,156
and take care of your mother from now on.

133
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:25,156
Just as you said, you got back on your feet.

134
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,756
I never felt happier

135
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,156
about having been a police detective than that time.

136
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:34,056
Rather, your mother was the one who was most happiest.

137
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,756
How is she?

138
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,156
What's the matter, Togashi?

139
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,356
Oh boy.

140
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:47,556
Don't go touching things here and there now, Conan.

141
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,156
I won't.

142
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,156
Please reconsider the eye-witness testimony

143
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,356
from the standpoint of the murder site.

144
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:55,156
Just how do I do something like that?

145
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:59,556
The culprit was witnessed from this window, right?

146
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,556
Huh?

147
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:03,256
Yeah, the eye-witness is, see over there...

148
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,756
that elderly woman.

149
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,056
Huh?

150
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,756
Why are there blood stains on two separated places,

151
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,756
one away from the other?

152
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,356
True, I wonder why?

153
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:15,256
These shiny things are shattered pieces of glass, right?

154
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,956
It's the mirror of the door of that closet.

155
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:22,256
Maybe it cracked when the victim and the culprit fought each other.

156
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,156
Was the murder weapon on the ground here?

157
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,556
-Yeah. -Any prints?

158
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:29,256
You mean on the murder weapon? None.

159
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:31,756
They were wiped off with something.

160
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,356
Not only were they wiped off from the murder weapon,

161
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:35,356
but also from the sliding door

162
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,156
and everything that the killer is thought to have touched.

163
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:40,856
Let me see it!

164
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:43,156
The prints of the victim aren't on it, either.

165
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,256
That's right. The kitchen, the bathroom,

166
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:48,556
the bedroom, also have no prints anywhere.

167
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:50,156
Everything's been completely wiped off.

168
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:53,156
I wonder why he went that far?

169
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:56,956
When and where was Mr. Togashi arrested?

170
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,856
Uh...

171
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:03,656
Last night at 22:30 in Beika Park.

172
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:06,556
What time was the murder witnessed?

173
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:10,156
10 minutes before that at around 22:20.

174
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:11,556
If you were to run from here to Beika Park,

175
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:15,156
it would take at least 7 or 8 minutes, right?

176
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:16,656
Which means?

177
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,856
It wouldn't have been possible for him to do all he did

178
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,556
in just a matter of a few minutes

179
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,656
after committing the crime!

180
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,856
He wiped the print off before committing the crime?

181
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,456
It can't be.

182
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:30,456
Then, he did it along with the crime.

183
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,456
Or, could there have been someone else?

184
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:35,956
Yeah, that's highly probable. But...

185
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:39,356
When he was arrested, Togashi was alone.

186
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:41,756
So, they fled separately?

187
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,156
Only a night has passed yet,

188
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,156
so maybe if we search for an eye-witness...

189
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,356
That's it!

190
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,156
"Beika Police Station."

191
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,056
Togashi.

192
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:54,056
Back then, when I arrested you,

193
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,456
you were outraged because a bunch of hoodlums

194
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,956
beat your friend up and was badly hurt,

195
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,456
and did what you did in a fury of anger, right?

196
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,756
Don't tell me that you're sticking up for somebody again?

197
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:12,156
You mean there was somebody else there?

198
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:14,656
Togashi, tell me the truth!

199
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,056
Please tell me the truth, Togashi!

200
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,156
Please stop it there!

201
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:40,456
-What? -This man.

202
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,756
What about him?

203
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:45,656
If I remember correctly, he...

204
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:54,256
So that's what it was!

205
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,756
What this?

206
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:59,956
About the thing that Pops forgot to tell you...

207
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:02,956
I forgot to ask you about it!

208
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,556
About reconsidering the eye-witness testimony,

209
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,156
he said to do it from both the murder site

210
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,456
as well as from the place it was witnessed from.

211
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,156
Granny, you saw the culprit from this window

212
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,256
through the window of the house over there, right?

213
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,156
"Kane Yoshizawa (75), eye-witness" -Yes. It was really frightening.

214
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:22,456
Thunder was roaring and there was a black-out.

215
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,156
I casually happened to look out the window and...

216
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,556
I couldn't make out his face,

217
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:33,356
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

218
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,956
Then, suddenly...

219
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:45,856
Why'd he throw the murder weapon towards the window?

220
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,556
-No, but the murder weapon... -Huh?

221
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:50,756
Right.

222
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,756
The murder weapon was found not on the side of the window,

223
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,556
but in front of the closet.

224
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,056
Maybe you saw wrong.

225
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:59,056
I've got good vision, you know.

226
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:02,356
My eyesight hasn't changed since I was in my 30's.

227
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:04,856
And, what happened after that?

228
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:07,656
I didn't see anything after that,

229
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:11,356
although lightning struck many times later too.

230
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:13,256
I see!

231
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:17,656
But if this is the truth, we're making a terrible mistake.

232
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,256
Pops!

233
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,176
Don't tell me, Inspector, that?

234
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,976
Too bad, Mr. Mouri.

235
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,176
It's almost time.

236
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:32,876
Wait!

237
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,576
There's still a little more time left.

238
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,076
Answer me, Togashi. Did you really...

239
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,176
You sure are persistent!

240
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,476
Mr. Mouri, time's up.

241
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,476
Togashi.

242
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:52,976
-Henyo. -Are you all right, Pops?

243
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,376
Come on, sit nicely!

244
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,676
And Officer Takagi wanted to tell you this.

245
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,476
It's about...

246
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,576
I'm sorry to have intruded on you!

247
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:08,176
What the heck is going on, letting out a strange cry?

248
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,376
If it's as usual, after this...

249
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,176
Please wait.

250
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,476
There is more behind this case!

251
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:17,376
Yes, yes! This is what happens!

252
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:21,976
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

253
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,876
I shall solve the case and show you the whole truth by 16:00,

254
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,776
the time he is to be taken to the prosecutor!

255
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,676
Okay, I'll let you handle it.

256
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:32,776
No, but...

257
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:35,676
It's as scheduled so there should be no problem.

258
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,676
So, just what is behind this case?

259
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,776
That there may in fact have been

260
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:46,076
another person at the site of the murder.

261
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,976
What?

262
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:49,376
That can't be?

263
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:53,376
Officer Takagi is checking the identity of this man right now.

264
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,976
Don't tell me that you're saying that man is the culprit?

265
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,476
It's ridiculous.

266
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:00,276
We've got an eye-witness testifying that she saw him!

267
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:03,276
She didn't see his face.

268
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,576
That's true.

269
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:08,776
Then, how would you explain the blood that was found on him?

270
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:10,576
Forensics already got results that

271
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,676
the blood matched that of the victim!

272
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,176
Too bad, he's got a motive.

273
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:21,576
Motive?

274
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:25,076
It seems that the victim was what you call an evil parole supervisor.

275
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,176
He seems to have gone around skilfully,

276
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:28,876
so that he wouldn't be reported to the police

277
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,076
and was squeezing money out of the criminal's family

278
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:34,076
by picking on their weakness.

279
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,476
Two years ago, your mother suffered

280
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:40,276
because of this and died ill, didn't she?

281
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:42,776
So, after all, he did...

282
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:47,376
No, if that's the motive, the other man fits right in too!

283
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,876
His wife and child have committed

284
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:51,576
after suffering the same ordeal!

285
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:54,676
The man in view on the surveillance camera of the convenience store,

286
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:57,276
Tsuneo Hakamada, age 34.

287
00:16:57,276 --> 00:17:01,176
He was released on parole yesterday together with Togashi.

288
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:04,076
Moreover, Hakamada is left-handed.

289
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:07,576
That explains why most of the wounds on the victim

290
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,876
was concentrated on the right side.

291
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,076
The eye-witness also said that

292
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:14,876
the killer was holding the murder weapon in his left hand!

293
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,176
Check where the man called Tsuneo Hakamada who was released on parole

294
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:20,376
from Musashino Prison yesterday is!

295
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:21,676
Yes, sir!

296
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:22,776
Wrong!

297
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,276
Hakamada has nothing to do with this!

298
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:28,076
It's me! I did it!

299
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,476
What?

300
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:36,476
Hakamada confessed to the crime?

301
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:38,076
What?

302
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,676
Hakamada.

303
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,476
Why...

304
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,676
It's okay, Togashi.

305
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,876
I was planning to turn myself

306
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,076
after visiting the grave of my wife and child to begin with.

307
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,676
So, there's no mistake about

308
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:53,076
you being the one who committed the crime?

309
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,476
Yeah.

310
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:57,776
I got close to him inside prison

311
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,676
and he found out about my plan to kill Sakuraba.

312
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:03,976
I brushed Togashi who tried to stop me away,

313
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:07,076
and somehow committed the murder.

314
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,076
Then, Togashi who arrived at the scene of the murder,

315
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,576
although surprised, told me to leave

316
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:16,676
getting rid of the prints and all to him, and to flee.

317
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:19,776
When I realized later, I had fled from the scene.

318
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:23,576
Moreover, he ends up being arrested in my place.

319
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,676
Talk about stupid.

320
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,076
In other words, after he told Hakamada to flee,

321
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,576
he didn't know where Hakamada had touched,

322
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:38,276
so he decided to wipe all the prints off everything,

323
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:39,676
including the things that the victim had touched.

324
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,376
No doubt about it.

325
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,376
Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:46,876
Thanks to you, we were spared arresting an innocent man!

327
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,176
I wonder about that.

328
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,776
Officer Takagi.

329
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:54,876
What time was Hakamada seen on the surveillance camera?

330
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:59,576
Uh, it was yesterday at 10:20.

331
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:02,376
What? That's...

332
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:05,276
Yes, that was the time...

333
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:09,276
Mrs. Kane Yoshizawa witnessed the murder.

334
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,976
Just what does that mean?

335
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:14,776
Hakamada would've had to be in two places at the same time.

336
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:17,176
But that's not possible, so...

337
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:19,976
Since Hakamada had blood on his clothes,

338
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:22,876
there's no doubt that he was once at the murder site.

339
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:27,576
But, after that, when he was witnessed from the house next door,

340
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:30,176
he was no longer at the site.

341
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,776
Officer Takagi.

342
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:34,676
What did the eye-witness say? About the murder weapon?

343
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:37,376
About the murder weapon?

344
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,176
I couldn't make out his face,

345
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,076
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

346
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,976
Then, suddenly...

347
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:48,076
He threw the murder weapon at the eye-witness?

348
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,576
Yes, but it's strange.

349
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:53,776
The murder weapon wasn't found by the window,

350
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,776
but rather among the shattered pieces of glass

351
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,876
from the cracked mirror in front of the closet.

352
00:19:56,876 --> 00:20:00,776
In other words, the killer didn't throw the weapon at Kane,

353
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:03,076
but rather, at the mirror.

354
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,076
What?

355
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:07,076
So, the eye-witness saw the figure of the culprit

356
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,276
that was reflected in the mirror?

357
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,776
Exactly! In other words,

358
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,676
the murder weapon that was held in the killer's left hand

359
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,076
was actually held in his right hand.

360
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,476
What?

361
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:20,176
And on the other hand,

362
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:24,976
the killer was surprised at the witness who was reflected in the mirror

363
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:26,876
and inadvertently threw the murder weapon at her,

364
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,076
cracking the mirror.

365
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,176
In other words,

366
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:33,276
the culprit who was witnessed at this time was right handed,

367
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:37,376
and the culprit who fled earlier was left handed.

368
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,376
Hold it.

369
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:41,476
Does that mean that the victim was killed twice?

370
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:44,276
There is only one thinkable answer.

371
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,676
The victim once thought to be dead, came to again

372
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:51,276
and was actually killed by the other person who was there!

373
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,476
What?

374
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:59,376
That culprit was indeed you, Togashi!

375
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,776
I just couldn't forgive that guy

376
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:09,876
for the suffering he put our families through.

377
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:13,276
I just couldn't forgive him!

378
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:20,876
The long day in the interrogation room is over.

379
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,176
I wish you told me the truth when I sat together with you

380
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,676
in the interrogation room yesterday, Togashi.

381
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:55,476
Well, I guess you couldn't tell a no good detective that didn't even know

382
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:58,076
that your mother had passed away, though.

383
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:03,976
I was afraid to tell the truth, so I just couldn't.

384
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,176
But thanks to you,

385
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,876
I was able to not make a scapegoat out of Hakamada.

386
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,376
Thank you very much!

387
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:13,476
What? Me again?

388
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,576
My memory in that area is not...

389
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,576
Well, I guess, that's the story!

390
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,376
Ran, contact Eri, will you?

391
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:30,076
Call mother?

392
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,276
Don't tell me that...

393
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,676
It's nothing like that.

394
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,876
You're going to ask her to act as Mr. Togashi's attorney, right?

395
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,576
I know.

396
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:41,576
But, while we're at it anyway, why not go eat with her or something?

397
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:43,776
If she insists we do, I guess why not while we're at it,

398
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,676
because it's not such a bad idea.

399
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,076
Hey, hey.

400
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,976
Using too many phrases like "if she insists" or "while we're at it"

401
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,876
may get you in trouble.

402
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:55,476
Talk about scary!

403
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:01,276
"Next Episode" -Anyway, how did you sprain your ankle?

404
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:03,776
I don't want to tell you about it!

405
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,776
A girl?

406
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:09,976
It seems like she ran away from the culprit and bumped into Ran,

407
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,976
and they're on the run together!

408
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:16,676
Ran. Why aren't you contacting us at all?

409
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,776
Haruna!

410
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:21,876
Let that girl go!

411
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:30,476
Next Conan, "Stork Mystery Tour (Ran's Search)"

412
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,465
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,665
"Letter."

414
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,065
The stage for the next episode is Kinosaki Spa in Hyogo prefecture.

415
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:49,365
I guess I'll go take a dip in the spa, too.

416
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:53,365
-You have to stay back here, Inspector. -What?
