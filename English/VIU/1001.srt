1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:02,082
Moonshade Island Village Office

2
00:00:02,107 --> 00:00:03,687
Based on that,

3
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:10,187
I believe only a few minutes have passed since the victim Mayor Kuroiwa's death.

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,137
A-A few minutes?

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:12,987
Yes.

6
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:15,367
That seems correct.

7
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:20,477
There's only five and a half minutes of silence at the beginning of this tape

8
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:23,207
of the "Moonlight Sonata"'s second movement.

9
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:24,687
I see.

10
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:25,947
Inspector.

11
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:30,457
There's a musical score written in blood beneath the chair the victim was sitting in.

12
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:31,467
What?

13
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,297
More musical scores.

14
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,937
Could this also be a dying message left by the victim?

15
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:41,937
No.

16
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:48,807
If he had the time and strength to write all this with his own blood, he would've called for help.

17
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:49,817
Stay out of this!

18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,357
You idiot! That's valuable evidence!

19
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:00,087
It's okay.

20
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,487
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

21
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,327
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

22
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,657
The sound of a piano rings out across a remote island!

23
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,917
What conclusion will it pass down?

24
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,547
Always determining the one truth

25
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:13,267
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

26
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,847
his name is Detective Conan!

27
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:03,445
"The 'Moonlight Sonata' Murder, Part Two!"

28
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,872
Let's jump right into it, Nishimoto-san.

29
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:12,492
You're the person who discovered Kuroiwa-san's body.

30
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:17,372
Kuroiwa told me to meet him in the broadcast room at 6:30.

31
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:23,152
Kuroiwa-san did say he was meeting someone this evening.

32
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,512
Are you sure you didn't tell him to meet you there so you could kill him?

33
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:26,512
O-Of course not!

34
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:29,092
Then why did he want to meet you?

35
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,072
I...

36
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:34,482
Looks like I'm right.

37
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,072
The culprit is—

38
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,272
It's Shimizu!

39
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:40,692
With mayoral election candidates Kawashima and my dad out of the way,

40
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:44,692
the mayor's seat automatically becomes his!

41
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,652
Don't be ridiculous!

42
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:49,117
There's no way I'd kill two people just to become the mayor!

43
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,152
What are you looking at, Conan-kun?

44
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,162
This musical score left at the crime scene.

45
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,962
I think this is probably a coded message left by the culprit.

46
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,962
Do these sharps and flats mean anything?

47
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,582
They refer to the black keys on the piano.

48
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:05,342
What?

49
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:08,822
You know, because they're symbols for a half step up or down.

50
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,142
The keys...

51
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,322
Hurry up and catch the murderer, Inspector!

52
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,322
Otherwise, more people will die!

53
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:20,982
You know you're next.

54
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:22,622
Conan-kun?

55
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:25,482
Once you figure out the key to this code, it's simple.

56
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:30,752
They've assigned the letters of the alphabet to the keys of the piano in order from left to right

57
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:35,492
and written the corresponding sounds as a musical score.

58
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:40,752
Reading the sheet music left at Kawashima-san's murder according to that assumption, we get...

59
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,502
"You know you're next."

60
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:46,542
See?

61
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,102
Wow!

62
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:50,932
Th-Then what about the musical score written in blood?

63
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:52,302
Let's see.

64
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,962
"The hellfire's grudge is settled."

65
00:04:57,962 --> 00:05:00,562
Th-The hellfire's grudge? Could it be?

66
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:04,482
The pianist who burned himself to death 12 years ago?

67
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:05,822
It's him.

68
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,952
I knew it. He's alive.

69
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,462
Aso Keiji is alive!

70
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:15,242
He's not alive.

71
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:19,372
The corpse found in the ruins matched his dental records.

72
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,872
That was definitely him.

73
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,552
Everything burnt to the ground.

74
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:27,502
All that was left was the sheet music inside his fireproof safe.

75
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:28,882
Sh-Sheet music?!

76
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,922
Where is that sheet music now?

77
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,462
In the community center's safe.

78
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:36,552
I believe I have the keys at the substation.

79
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,642
Then hurry up and bring them here!

80
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,772
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,522
I'll go with you!

82
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:48,152
Hey, did Aso-san really set his own house on fire?

83
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:50,782
Yeah, according to the witnesses.

84
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:52,662
What witnesses?

85
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:56,852
The previous mayor Kameyama-san, Kawashima-san,

86
00:05:56,852 --> 00:06:00,792
the current mayor Kuroiwa, and Nishimoto-san.

87
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:01,162
What?

88
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:04,672
Aside from Nishimoto-san, they're all dead.

89
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,002
Then what about that Murasawa guy?

90
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:11,632
He came to this island about three years ago.

91
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:15,012
He got engaged to the mayor's daughter just the other day.

92
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:18,912
Really? What about the mayor's secretary Hirata-san?

93
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,292
He's a strange fellow.

94
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:23,392
I don't know what he was doing,

95
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:27,402
but I often saw him secretly meeting with Kawashima-san at the community center.

96
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,642
What about Shimizu-san?

97
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,642
He's a respectable man.

98
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,782
His only flaw is that he's a bit short-tempered.

99
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,202
Huh? That's odd.

100
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,212
I know I put it around here somewhere.

101
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:46,462
Jeez. We've been looking for over an hour already.

102
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,342
Ah, here it is. This is the key.

103
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,592
Then let's hurry back to Inspector Megure.

104
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:52,172
Sure.

105
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:53,442
You're too late.

106
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:53,842
What?

107
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:57,562
Everyone got tired of waiting and left.

108
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:57,972
What?!

109
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,972
They let the suspects leave, too?

110
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:06,732
Yeah. Since the culprit's last message said, "The hellfire's grudge is settled,"

111
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,732
they thought there wouldn't be anymore murders.

112
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:10,782
That can't be!

113
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:13,742
There's still the third movement of the "Moonlight Sonata."

114
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:16,072
I'm going to the community center!

115
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,742
Wait, Conan-kun.

116
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:19,992
Officer, hurry.

117
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:22,792
We need to check that sheet music as soon as possible.

118
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,502
Don't rush me.

119
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:32,872
Hey, did you just hear a strange noise coming from the room with the piano?

120
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:34,362
Did you?

121
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:41,682
Bastard!

122
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:49,112
Murasawa-san?

123
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,612
Ran?

124
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,572
Ran-neechan!

125
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,342
What's wrong?

126
00:07:58,732 --> 00:07:59,992
Nishimoto-san...

127
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,602
Officer, contact the Inspector immediately!

128
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,132
Got it.

129
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,552
That was the sound of this stopping.

130
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,432
It contains a 60 minute tape.

131
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:17,772
Since each side is 30 minutes, Nishimoto-san probably died within the last 30 minutes.

132
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,712
Conan-kun.

133
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,182
Look next to Nishimoto-san's feet.

134
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:22,682
Huh?

135
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,142
Sheet music.

136
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:29,142
What does it say this time?

137
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:30,942
"Suicide note."

138
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:36,102
Suicide note? You mean Nishimoto-san...

139
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,532
He killed himself, huh?

140
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:44,502
According to this note, he regretted killing Kawashima and Kuroiwa.

141
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,112
So it was Nishimoto who killed them.

142
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:52,542
His motive was that he didn't want the mistake

143
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,082
he committed with Kawashima, Kuroiwa, Kameyama,

144
00:08:55,082 --> 00:09:00,102
who died two years ago, and Aso,

145
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,342
who killed himself 12 years ago, to be exposed.

146
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:05,012
Even the pianist Aso?

147
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,142
Yeah.

148
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:10,102
It says that Aso came up with the code.

149
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:14,452
They must've done something using this code.

150
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,822
I see.

151
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:21,362
Nishimoto believed the sheet music that survived the fire described their old secret.

152
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:25,492
In order to destroy the sheet music, he broke into the safe,

153
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:29,722
but couldn't find the sheet music, so he killed himself.

154
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:30,432
No...

155
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,072
I don't think he killed himself.

156
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,582
What?

157
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:36,342
Look closely at the spot where the body's feet were.

158
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,092
There's nothing there for him to step on.

159
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:42,812
Normally a person wouldn't be able to do that without a step of some kind.

160
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:46,352
In other words, it's hard to imagine that this was a suicide.

161
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,602
I saw someone suspicious.

162
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:49,712
What?

163
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:51,732
There were two people in the piano room.

164
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:57,332
One of them broke the window and fled, but the other one was Murasawa.

165
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,732
He was on the floor because someone struck him.

166
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,742
Doctor Narumi's examining him in the piano room right now.

167
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,752
You should've told us that sooner.

168
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:13,692
Officer, did you find Aso-san's sheet music?

169
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:14,212
No.

170
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,542
After all, it happened 12 years ago.

171
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,462
I have no idea where I put it.

172
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,352
I believe he has a concussion,

173
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,912
but I can't say for certain unless I examine him properly at the clinic.

174
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,422
I see.

175
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:32,332
By the way, Kuroiwa-san, what was Murasawa-san doing here?

176
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,062
I don't know!

177
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,562
I'd like to know the answer to that question, too.

178
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:39,882
What's this?

179
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:40,862
Don't touch that!

180
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:43,092
It belongs to Shuichi.

181
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,402
What is that?

182
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,822
I don't know, but it seemed important to him.

183
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:51,912
That's a tuning hammer used to tune pianos.

184
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:53,992
Does that mean he...?

185
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:58,792
In any case, gather all the suspects at the village office.

186
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,462
We're going to interview them again.

187
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:01,272
Yes, sir.

188
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,972
What is it, Conan-kun?

189
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,772
The suspicious person who fled through the window

190
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,812
was searching the bottom of the piano before they ran.

191
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,832
I thought there might be something here.

192
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,702
What? Seriously?

193
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,252
It's a secret door.

194
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:34,832
What is this? Could it be?

195
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:44,025
Judging by the methods used,

196
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,945
the three murders that have taken place

197
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,285
on this island were almost certainly committed by the same person.

198
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,075
What is it?

199
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,285
Something's not right.

200
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:58,515
Ever since I saw the code left at the second crime scene, something has seemed strange.

201
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,155
Inspector Megure.

202
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,985
The photos we took of the scene of Kuroiwa's murder have been developed.

203
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:05,605
Thank you.

204
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,335
Could you lay them out over there?

205
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:07,985
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,135
Doctor Narumi, is Murasawa-san still unconscious?

207
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,145
Reiko-san is taking care of him, but he still hasn't regained consciousness.

208
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:20,805
What's this thing shining by Kuroiwa-san's neck?

209
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,385
It disappeared after the body was moved.

210
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,145
Um, Inspector?

211
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,405
Could I go buy something to drink?

212
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,735
I'm thirsty.

213
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:32,595
Very well.

214
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,775
Hey, mister.

215
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,255
You've got white powder on your sleeve.

216
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:47,635
Wow, that's a lot of foreign money.

217
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,155
I like foreign coins.

218
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,535
Really?

219
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,975
K-Kid!

220
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:00,955
I finally found the sheet music Aso-san left behind.

221
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,005
Let me see that.

222
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,145
Hey.

223
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:06,955
"To my son Seiji."

224
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:13,615
I thought Aso-san had a wife and daughter who he took with him.

225
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,995
Come to think of it, he had a son, too.

226
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:22,705
He fell terribly ill as a child and was hospitalized on the mainland.

227
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,745
I believe his name was...

228
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:25,975
Seiji.

229
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,255
Could it be?

230
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:40,685
I see. So that's how it is.

231
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:46,365
The reason the culprit moved Kawashima-san to the piano room after drowning him.

232
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,405
The meaning behind the music left at all three crime scenes.

233
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:55,195
And the mystery of the code written in blood.

234
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,215
It's definitely them. They're the culprit.

235
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,705
What's wrong with you?

236
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:05,925
Why'd you suddenly run into the broadcast room?

237
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:11,215
In any case, tomorrow morning we'll interview you two and Murasawa-san,

238
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:13,055
who's resting at the clinic.

239
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:18,215
Inspector, I've figured out most of what happened on this island.

240
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:19,975
Dad?

241
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:24,835
First, the person who knocked out Murasawa-san in the piano room tonight

242
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,205
was Hirata-san.

243
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,615
He suffered the injury on his left hand when he broke through the window and fled.

244
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:39,435
Hirata-san was using the secret door on the underside of the piano

245
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,005
to conduct drug deals with Kawashima.

246
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,325
D-Drugs?!

247
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,295
He probably struck Murasawa-san

248
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:49,815
and ran because he saw him collecting the leftover drugs.

249
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:53,125
Then he got into an argument over the drugs with Kawashima, and...

250
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,005
N-No!

251
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:58,135
However, Hirata-san isn't connected to the three murders.

252
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,005
What?

253
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:03,515
If he were the culprit, he wouldn't have moved the body into the piano room.

254
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:07,285
After all, the drugs left in the piano could be discovered.

255
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,035
I see.

256
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,385
Then there's Murasawa-san, who was knocked out.

257
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,470
He's the culprit?

258
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,485
He isn't the culprit either.

259
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:16,405
What?

260
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:20,155
The culprit prepared a suicide note to disguise his murder as a suicide,

261
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:24,665
but they fled in such a hurry that they forgot to leave a step.

262
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,895
It's hard to imagine someone who did that would go to the piano room.

263
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,465
Y-You're right.

264
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,715
Then who killed them?

265
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,965
Direct your attention to the second case.

266
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:40,775
Kuroiwa-san was allegedly murdered only a few minutes before his body was discovered.

267
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:44,765
Recall how the code written in blood

268
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:51,065
didn't smear even though Conan fell on top of it.

269
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:54,935
However, at room temperature,

270
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,975
it takes blood 15 to 30 minutes to dry.

271
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,575
Because there were only five minutes and 30 seconds of silence

272
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:05,495
at the start of the tape that was playing,

273
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:09,705
we believed the murder occurred only a few minutes before the body was discovered.

274
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:15,035
But by playing the tape from the blank B side,

275
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:19,555
the culprit delayed the music by over 30 minutes

276
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,725
using the tape player's auto-reverse feature.

277
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,475
Auto-reverse?

278
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,795
Normally, once a tape player finishes playing the A side,

279
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:33,335
you flip over the cassette and begin playing the B side.

280
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:37,425
But the auto-reverse feature inverts the tape head to play the opposite side.

281
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,065
Take a look at the crime scene photos.

282
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:45,195
There's a switch shining next to the body's neck,

283
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:49,405
but in the photo taken after the body was moved, it's gone.

284
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:54,935
It proves the culprit deactivated the auto-reverse while the police weren't looking.

285
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:58,635
But the only person who approached the body then was...

286
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:02,425
The only person besides the police who could approach the body

287
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:08,435
or fake the estimated time of death was the person who examined it, Doctor Narumi.

288
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,935
You're the only one who could have done it.

289
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,815
Doctor Narumi?

290
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:18,365
The reason you left a few minutes of silence at the beginning on the tape

291
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,025
that played during the first murder

292
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:24,895
was to make us believe the culprit once again

293
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:28,285
used that same silence during the second murder to flee the crime scene.

294
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:32,145
Furthermore, you drowned Kawashima-san

295
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:34,955
so the coroner would return to the mainland with the body,

296
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:38,295
and so you'd be asked to examine the body during the second murder,

297
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,795
allowing you to enact your trick.

298
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,765
Doctor Narumi's motive for these three murders

299
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,215
can be traced back to 12 years ago.

300
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,685
12 years ago?

301
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:55,385
12 years ago, the pianist Aso Keiji-san burned himself to death.

302
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:58,595
However, he was actually murdered

303
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:03,305
by Kawashima-san, Kuroiwa-san,

304
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:04,545
and Nishimoto-san,

305
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,825
who were killed in this case, as well as Kameyama-san, who died two years ago.

306
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,955
H-He was murdered?

307
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,605
They used Aso-san's international performances

308
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:20,065
to purchase drugs and used the secret door in the piano to sell them.

309
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:24,925
However, Aso-san told them that he wouldn't work with them anymore.

310
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:34,475
All of this is described in the sheet music found in the burnt remains of the house.

311
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:41,735
Just before his death, Aso-san wrote a confession to his son Seiji.

312
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,135
His son?

313
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,365
Wait, Seiji? Could it be?

314
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:49,775
Doctor Narumi's actual name is Seiji.

315
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:54,235
He's actually Aso Keiji's son, Aso Seiji.

316
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,185
No way.

317
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:59,655
So he did it to avenge his father?

318
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,805
Inspector!

319
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,775
Asai Narumi is missing.

320
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,385
What?

321
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:07,235
Find him! Don't let him escape!

322
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:08,375
He'll be there,

323
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:11,015
where his father's piano was donated.

324
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:13,625
The Moonshade Island community center!

325
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,485
It's over, Dad.

326
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,445
It's all over.

327
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,375
It's not over yet.

328
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:29,285
You can't die.

329
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,285
Conan-kun.

330
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:35,285
It's written right here in the sheet music your father left you.

331
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:39,295
"Seiji, at least you can live a decent life."

332
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:43,315
If he'd written that,

333
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,195
then maybe I wouldn't have needed to do this.

334
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:46,805
What?

335
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:51,895
I couldn't believe that my father had done that.

336
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,685
I couldn't believe he'd killed my mother and sister before killing himself.

337
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:01,045
So after graduating from medical school, I came to this island in order to find the truth.

338
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:06,665
I disguised myself as a woman doctor so people wouldn't discover that I was Aso Keiji's son.

339
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:12,165
Since the reading of my name isn't written on my medical license, nobody suspected me.

340
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:16,805
I learned what happened to my father

341
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:21,155
when the previous mayor Kameyama told me to meet him here in this room.

342
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:25,385
When he learned that I was Aso Keiji's son,

343
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:28,215
he suddenly became frightened and told me everything.

344
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:33,475
About the drugs, the code, and my father's murder.

345
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:37,325
Once he finished talking, he was suddenly wracked with pain.

346
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,345
He died of a heart attack.

347
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:46,735
That's when I came up with these murders...

348
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:53,615
while playing the "Moonlight Sonata" my father loved next to his body as a requiem.

349
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,665
In any case, let's get out of here, Seiji-san.

350
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,505
There's still time.

351
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,335
It's too late.

352
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:04,235
What?

353
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,045
My hands are like theirs now.

354
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,055
Covered in blood.

355
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,805
Seiji-san...

356
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,195
Conan-kun?

357
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,105
Damn it!

358
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,255
Don't!

359
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,125
Let go!

360
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:25,755
What's that sound?

361
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,855
A code.

362
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:33,205
He's playing the piano amidst those flames.

363
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,145
Special Thanks To everyone who loves Conan

364
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:04,375
The community center continued to burn until morning, when it finally burnt down completely.

365
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:11,615
Apparently Murasawa-san missed the pianist Aso Keiji and occasionally tuned that piano.

366
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:15,015
It's what he was doing the night he was struck.

367
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:18,395
Anyway...

368
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,785
I wonder why Doctor Narumi sent Dad that letter.

369
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:28,855
He probably wanted someone to stop him from murdering those people.

370
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:34,905
Hey, what was the code Doctor Narumi played?

371
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:37,285
I forgot already.

372
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:40,035
I can tell by the look on your face that you haven't.

373
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,026
Come on, tell me.

374
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,402
(Thank you, little detective.)

375
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,195
I'll tickle you.

376
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,695
Stop!
