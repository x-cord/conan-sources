1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,730
Mori Detective Agency

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,230
I'm so bored.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,919
When detectives are bored, doesn't that mean the world is at peace?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,080
Well, yeah.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,080
Yes?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,400
Come in.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,629
Is this the Mori Detective Agency?

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,290
Yes.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,630
She's beautiful!

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,630
Here you go.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,049
Thank you.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,890
So, what did you want to discuss?

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,220
Well...

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,109
I hadn't introduced myself yet.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,900
My name is Muto Masako.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,819
Masako-san. That's a beautiful name.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,609
Anyway, I'd like you to find someone for me.

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,150
My husband Muto Issei.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,600
You want me to find your husband?

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,920
Your husband, huh?

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,809
Find the question that solves the mystery!

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,909
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,999
An odd request from a beautiful wife,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,379
and the suspicious behavior of her beloved husband!

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,129
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,869
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,150
his name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,960
The Two Faces (Part One)

29
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:19,603
I don't know what to do.

30
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:21,603
I see.

31
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,052
Mister, talk to her.

32
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,363
Uh, right.

33
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,733
Could you describe the events leading up to your husband's disappearance?

34
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,862
In as much detail as possible, please.

35
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:36,973
All right.

36
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:43,753
My husband Muto Issei runs a trading company that imports and sells goods from overseas.

37
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:48,212
We got married six months ago.

38
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:53,283
I believed our relationship was nothing short of perfect.

39
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,883
Until that happened...

40
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,393
What happened?

41
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:08,273
Last week, I went to a restaurant to have lunch with some friends.

42
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:12,723
As I was heading home after finishing lunch and parting ways with my friends,

43
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,533
I spotted my husband.

44
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:20,143
I thought he was there for a meeting and tried to call out to him...

45
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,122
But I saw him speaking intimately with a woman I didn't recognize.

46
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:31,833
I was curious about what their relationship was and followed them.

47
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,643
Happens all the time.

48
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:50,273
But they parted ways without doing anything in particular,

49
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:53,443
so I decided to say hello to him.

50
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,493
Issei-san!

51
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:56,323
Huh?

52
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,453
Issei-san, what are you doing here?

53
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:02,632
He ran?

54
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,453
Yes.

55
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:05,953
At full speed.

56
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,713
I did my best to chase after my fleeing husband.

57
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,672
But by the time I reached the river,

58
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:21,023
I had lost sight of him.

59
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,562
I wasn't sure if I should,

60
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,293
but I ended up calling the police.

61
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:32,443
But I doubt they understood even half of what I had to say.

62
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:36,452
I waited at home for a while to hear from them,

63
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:39,193
but it seemed like they weren't making any progress,

64
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:43,452
so I decided to visit you.

65
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:44,902
I see.

66
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,203
A wise decision.

67
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:52,542
Please. I can't sleep at night like this.

68
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:56,213
Could you please find my husband?

69
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,142
You can count on me.

70
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,593
I swear on my good name that I will find your husband.

71
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,723
Thank you.

72
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:11,483
By the way, do you have any idea why your husband might have disappeared?

73
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:13,312
No, I have no idea.

74
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:18,983
Like I said before, I didn't think we had any problems until now.

75
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,733
I see.

76
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:29,033
Did you notice anything odd when you lost track of your husband?

77
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,663
Stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong!

78
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:35,673
Come to think of it, I don't know if it's related to the case,

79
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:41,423
but I think a vehicle drove away just as I arrived.

80
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,902
First, I'd like to investigate your husband's office.

81
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:51,153
Very well.

82
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,523
What are you doing here?

83
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,653
Ran-neechan told me to go with you since she's worried about you.

84
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,163
Jeez.

85
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,313
This is it.

86
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,532
Why do I feel like something's not right?

87
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,563
Boy.

88
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,523
This way.

89
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:37,953
Okay!

90
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:43,073
This is my husband's office.

91
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,552
Is it all right if I investigate the room?

92
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,913
Yes, of course.

93
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:57,523
Thank you.

94
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,683
What the heck is going on?

95
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:18,193
There's nothing suspicious among the documents in his desk.

96
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:21,432
There's nothing odd inside his closet either.

97
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,302
This room doesn't feel lived in.

98
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,073
Yeah.

99
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:28,302
There's hardly anything personal in here.

100
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,292
I have no idea where we're supposed to begin.

101
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:32,652
Then how about this?

102
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,203
What's this?

103
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,833
A starting point.

104
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,933
Let's see...

105
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,712
This is it.

106
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,663
No matter how you look at it, this is clearly a first-rate corporation.

107
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:58,333
Muto Trading Company, Muto Trading Company...

108
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:00,562
It's not here.

109
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,603
What's going on here?

110
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:06,863
Excuse me. I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.

111
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:10,652
I'd like to meet with Muto-san of the Muto Trading Company.

112
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:14,382
Very well. Do you have an appointment?

113
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,323
No.

114
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,623
One moment, please.

115
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:23,472
Hello? There's a detective here at reception named Mori Kogoro.

116
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:25,523
He says he'd like to speak with Muto-san.

117
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:27,123
Yes.

118
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:29,073
No, he doesn't.

119
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:30,383
Yes.

120
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:31,963
Yes.

121
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,863
Understood.

122
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:39,972
I'm sorry. Muto is currently out of the office.

123
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,643
I'd be happy to meet with another employee.

124
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,822
But without an appointment—

125
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,933
Mister, over here.

126
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:51,772
I don't think we'll find any employees here.

127
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,163
After all, this place is a virtual office.

128
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:55,692
A what?

129
00:09:55,693 --> 00:10:02,913
A virtual office is an imaginary office young companies use to reduce costs.

130
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:08,202
It allows them to acquire a prestigious address like this one for cheap.

131
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:14,683
It may be imaginary, but there must be someone receiving phone calls and mail.

132
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,683
Those are set up to be forwarded, too.

133
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:22,052
What's going on here?

134
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:28,203
Why was the husband renting an imaginary office here?

135
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:34,703
So this is where Masako-san lost sight of her husband.

136
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:40,703
The question is what happened here?

137
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:44,932
If he fled the moment he saw Masako-san's face,

138
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:48,163
we can assume he chose to disappear.

139
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:52,132
But why did he flee when he saw his wife?

140
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,223
Why did he flee to this river?

141
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,853
There must be some reason he came here.

142
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,513
That means...

143
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:05,523
Was he attacked by someone, or did he fall into the river?

144
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:10,023
Was it an accident, or was there foul play?

145
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:15,873
There should be some evidence around here backing up Masako-san's story.

146
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:20,292
Why won't her husband contact her?

147
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,493
Mister, over here!

148
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,672
Did you find something?

149
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:26,783
Look at this.

150
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,133
Those are tire tracks.

151
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:34,763
These might be from the vehicle Masako-san said she saw driving away.

152
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:39,013
Judging by the width of the tracks, it might be a microcar.

153
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:43,272
You're saying the president of a trading company ran off in a microcar?

154
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:45,433
I don't know that, but...

155
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,123
Hello?

156
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,032
Ah, Masako-san.

157
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:52,843
Yes.

158
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,712
Yes.

159
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,533
What?

160
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,193
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

161
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,033
Mori-san, thank you for coming.

162
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:05,352
What's this about a wallet they found?

163
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:06,543
This is it.

164
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:12,433
It was discovered about 400 meters away from the river where I lost sight of my husband.

165
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:16,162
All the cash was taken,

166
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:19,432
but his cards were still here, so they contacted me.

167
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,472
Any fingerprints?

168
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,053
No. They were wiped clean.

169
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,422
May I take a look?

170
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:26,963
Yes, go ahead.

171
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:33,823
Credit cards, membership cards, and...

172
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:36,323
There's a few receipts in here.

173
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,323
Let me see those.

174
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,583
They're all receipts for convenience stores and restaurants.

175
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,793
I see how it is.

176
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,263
Jeez.

177
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,173
Where did he go?

178
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,553
Hey, mister.

179
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:13,103
You think these receipts are the key to finding Issei-san, right?

180
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,423
Huh?

181
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,712
How are those receipts supposed to help us find him?

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,273
Thanks for waiting, Dad.

183
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:21,493
I brought a detailed map of Haido City.

184
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,712
A map of Haido City?

185
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:25,302
I didn't ask for that.

186
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:26,303
What?

187
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,873
But Conan-kun said...

188
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:29,873
I know!

189
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:34,612
Mister, you're going to use this map to find the missing husband, right?

190
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,153
What?

191
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:38,282
Ran-neechan, could you lay that map out over there?

192
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:40,942
I'll read out the names of the stores on these receipts,

193
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,802
so could you mark them on the map?

194
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:43,473
Okay.

195
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,303
That's what you wanted, right, mister?

196
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:47,563
Uh, yeah...

197
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:52,483
I'm ready, Conan-kun.

198
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,073
First is SunDay Mart on second street.

199
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,522
SunDay Mart on second street...

200
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:02,723
Found it.

201
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,933
Next is Danny's in Haido City.

202
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,402
Family restaurant Haidoya.

203
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:11,813
Haidoya...

204
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,133
Found it.

205
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,552
Daily TMS on second street.

206
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,723
Daily TMS...

207
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:20,913
Here it is.

208
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:23,973
Finally, SunDay Mart on second street.

209
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:29,603
I see.

210
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,373
His life is focused around this area.

211
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:40,443
But this is nowhere near Muto-san's house or the virtual office.

212
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,243
That's it!

213
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:49,742
The husband is secretly doing something in this area other than running a trading company.

214
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:52,762
Then if you question people in this area...

215
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:56,922
We can know more or less where he is without doing that.

216
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,133
Right, Mister?

217
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,303
What? Uh, yeah...

218
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,763
We can use this.

219
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,303
A compass?

220
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,492
Unless you're buying a product that's only available at certain stores,

221
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,202
people generally go to the closest convenience store.

222
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:15,013
Yeah.

223
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:20,132
So if we draw a few circles

224
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,533
around the stores we marked a bunch of times...

225
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:26,983
And done.

226
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,072
What's this?

227
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:34,802
It means the missing husband is somewhere inside these circles.

228
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:40,253
Furthermore, it's likely that he's here where the three circles overlap.

229
00:15:55,363 --> 00:16:00,352
Mister, haven't you felt like something is off since we visited Muto-san's house?

230
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,023
Something feels off?

231
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:05,192
Even though he runs an import trading company,

232
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:08,802
there weren't any foreign imports at his house.

233
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,453
I-I guess not.

234
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,212
All the appliances around the house were outdated, too.

235
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:18,213
They had nothing in common and were all totally different styles and brands.

236
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:21,962
I did get that sense, too.

237
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:25,872
Then there's the microcar tire tracks at the river.

238
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:26,463
Yeah.

239
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,973
Those must have been left by that mini truck.

240
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,702
All right. Let's go check it out.

241
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:33,603
Yeah.

242
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:41,943
Huh?

243
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:51,663
Excuse me.

244
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,902
What is it?

245
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,913
Have you seen this man?

246
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,852
The president?

247
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,652
He's right over there.

248
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,673
President?

249
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,332
Muto-san is the president here?

250
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,803
Yeah.

251
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:10,932
H-He's supposed to be the president of a trading company renting a virtual office,

252
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,302
but he's the president of a second-hand shop?

253
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,133
What's going on here?

254
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:17,853
There he is!

255
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,393
That's him!

256
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:20,943
Muto-san!

257
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:28,943
I see.

258
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,562
That's what Masako said?

259
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:32,453
Yes.

260
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:36,392
After conducting an investigation at your wife's request,

261
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:38,542
I ended up here.

262
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:41,052
You truly are a great detective.

263
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:44,563
I never thought I'd be found this quickly.

264
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:53,063
More importantly, Muto-san, I have honestly no idea why you left your wife.

265
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,183
Could you explain the situation?

266
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:04,443
I lied to my wife on our first date.

267
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:11,193
In order to make myself look better, I said I ran an import trading company.

268
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:17,773
I ended up marrying Masako before I could tell her the truth.

269
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:27,713
I began to think maintaining the lie would hurt Masako less than telling her the truth.

270
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:32,832
So you went as far as renting a virtual office to maintain the lie.

271
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,803
Yes.

272
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:38,723
I didn't want to destroy her dreams.

273
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,983
Her dreams, huh?

274
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:47,313
But now I'm being punished.

275
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:51,043
I didn't think Masako would find me there.

276
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,632
But why did you run?

277
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,993
Your wife simply saw you speaking with a woman.

278
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:02,123
I thought she'd overheard our conversation!

279
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:07,292
The woman I was with is a client.

280
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:11,133
I thought I couldn't talk my way out of it and panicked.

281
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:16,633
And?

282
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,563
What are you going to do now?

283
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,643
Muto-san.

284
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,963
What should I do?

285
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:34,153
I don't know what to do, so I haven't been able to do anything.

286
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,493
If you think...

287
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:46,873
If you think it's not too late, then shouldn't you go back to her?

288
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,053
What?

289
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:52,383
You don't seem like a bad person.

290
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:57,393
Can't you and your wife get along even after all this happened?

291
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,233
Besides, I believe that's what she wants.

292
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,022
However, I don't think you should lie anymore.

293
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:11,153
Women have keen instincts.

294
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:15,653
Very well. I'll do that.

295
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:28,163
Mori Detective Agency

296
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,263
Hello, Mori Detective Agency.

297
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,173
Ah, Masako-san.

298
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:38,312
My husband just returned.

299
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:39,732
I see.

300
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,642
Thank you so much for everything.

301
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,933
So, how did your conversation go?

302
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:55,352
We do have quite a few problems, but we've decided to start over together.

303
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:58,193
I see. That's good.

304
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:04,542
Unbelievable. If he'd just told me the truth from the start,

305
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:07,132
this wouldn't have happened.

306
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,022
Absolutely.

307
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:14,583
But all men want to show off every now and then.

308
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:21,713
I really have no idea how to thank you.

309
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,492
Yes, thank you.

310
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,413
Goodbye.

311
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:41,113
The case is closed, Mister.

312
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:42,273
Yeah.

313
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:47,832
Missing person and infidelity cases rarely end well,

314
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,123
but maybe it really is settled this time.

315
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,572
Muto-san is dead?!

316
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,073
They ended up like that.

317
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:54,203
How did you know the victim was the husband?

318
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:58,873
Judging by the room's state, it looks like they were in a hurry to go somewhere.

319
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,683
The next episode of Conan is "The Two Faces, Part Two!"
