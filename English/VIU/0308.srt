1
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:04,813
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:07,013
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:09,113
The unnatural death of the last days of the victim.

4
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:10,613
A surprising message if found.

5
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:12,313
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,413
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,614
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:58,377
Pops takes on the job of searching for the whereabouts

9
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:01,878
of a game system engineer, whose whereabouts became unknown.

10
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,877
But while listening to their story,

11
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,277
I found out that Mr. Itakura

12
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:11,178
had once had contact with the Black Organization.

13
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:15,877
We somehow located the hotel where Mr. Itakura was hiding,

14
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,077
and went there,

15
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:21,278
but it turned out that he was already dead.

16
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,577
I see.

17
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:30,277
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

18
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:33,077
tied up with his hands on his chest,

19
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:37,077
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

20
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,377
Then, don't tell me that this is...

21
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:43,378
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

22
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,078
A homicide.

23
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,478
Oh, no.

24
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:59,178
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 2)"

25
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,677
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -Wait a second.

26
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,777
Why do we have to be suspected?

27
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,477
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -We the ones who asked Kogoro Mouri

28
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,377
to look for Mr. Itakura, you know.

29
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,477
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -What stupid killer would come back

30
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:16,778
to the scene of a crime and bring a detective along?

31
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,578
I guess so.

32
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,477
If you insist on suspecting us, why don't you show evidence?

33
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,077
Evidence that we came here.

34
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,077
Okay, the time's now.

35
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:32,977
If so, why don't you look at the diary in the bag?

36
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,677
That's his bag, isn't it?

37
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,277
Maybe we can find out

38
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:40,278
who came to visit him before we got here.

39
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,378
A "diary" is indeed written on it.

40
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:50,077
Officer Takagi, how do you look at this?

41
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,178
It can easily be viewed with the laptop computer on the desk.

42
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:57,377
But if I were the killer,

43
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:00,778
I would've gotten rid of something like that a long time ago.

44
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,377
This is it.

45
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,878
Mr. Itakura seems to have been keeping a diary every day since 5 years ago.

46
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,077
Which means it's in there, I'm sure.

47
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:21,078
The day two years ago when Tequila came to see him should be there.

48
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,578
Here it is. This is his most recent diary.

49
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,878
Three days ago.

50
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:32,577
"The hotel employee said something strange today.

51
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:37,877
Maybe one of the three found out what room I'm in?

52
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:42,778
Oh, well. All I've got to do is change hotels then."

53
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:48,078
You three are suspicious after all.

54
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,977
Isn't there a continuation to that diary?

55
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,777
No, there's none.

56
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:58,377
Then, I'll go put it back where it was.

57
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,378
Oh, okay.

58
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:03,377
All right.

59
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:04,378
No.

60
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:07,977
We'll pass it on to the forensic officers just to be on the safe side.

61
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:08,978
I agree.

62
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,977
Shoots. If the police take it with them,

63
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,977
I won't ever get to see it again.

64
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:17,077
I've got to find the killer among the three as soon a possible

65
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:20,978
and prove that the diary has nothing to do with the murder.

66
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:26,877
Cool head. I'm sure that something's been overlooked.

67
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,277
That is, the clue to who the killer is.

68
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,678
Excuse me, inspector.

69
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:36,177
-What is it? -About the right ankle of the corpse...

70
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,877
Traces of his socks are left as seen by congested blood on his left leg,

71
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:42,277
while his right leg...

72
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,778
Take a look at this, no traces are left on his right leg.

73
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,577
On the other hand, on his right ankle,

74
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,077
there are traces of what look to be scratch marks

75
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:52,877
that seem to have been made by the toenail of his left foot.

76
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:53,878
Which means that Mr. Itakura

77
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,878
tried to take the socks off from his right leg.

78
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,478
But why?

79
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,477
He was tied up in a place like this,

80
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,478
but why did he...

81
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,578
take off his socks?

82
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:19,777
I see, he did so to leave this behind.

83
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,678
No doubt about it. That person's the killer.

84
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:26,777
Moreover, if I use this to my advantage,

85
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:29,178
I can even get a hold of the diary, too.

86
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:37,077
All right. Please take care of the autopsy, coroner.

87
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:38,578
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:43,377
Officer Takagi, give the diary of the victim to the forensic officer.

89
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:44,478
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,977
The point in question

91
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,577
is the one who orders Mr. Itakura to make the game software

92
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,177
and found Mr. Itakura's corpse.

93
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,977
The three of you who all employees of the same game company.

94
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,577
We're not from the same company.

95
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,277
We're all from different companies.

96
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,177
I am Sugai who asked him to make an Igo software.

97
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:06,277
I'm Naito who asked him to make a chess software.

98
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:10,077
I'm Soma. I ordered a shogi software.

99
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,377
Please, let us go already.

100
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:16,677
We just happened to be brought here to this room

101
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:20,478
by Mr. Mouri who located where Mr. Itakura was.

102
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:26,078
Inspector, what about me?

103
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:32,377
Well, we know now that Mr. Itakura had been killed by someone,

104
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:36,378
but we don't have all the evidence to specify the killer.

105
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,777
I would like the Mouri group and all of you

106
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:43,177
to come over to the station at a later date.

107
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,477
Oh, great.

108
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:46,777
I was concerned about whether the drama

109
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:50,078
that I've been recording was being recorded right.

110
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,677
So, I guess I'll do as you say for now and...

111
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,978
No, I can't afford to leave just like that.

112
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,878
Oh, no. I mean, well...

113
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,778
Who was that?

114
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,578
I'm saying that we can't let the suspects leave this place.

115
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:12,977
Because the killer

116
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:15,078
is rejoicing with both arms open...

117
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:20,177
in front of our very eyes, thinking,

118
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:24,777
"How lucky that Inspector Megure is a klutz".

119
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:26,477
What?

120
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:27,777
Hey, Dad!

121
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,478
How rude!

122
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,877
Shape up, Pops.

123
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:36,677
Saying all you did, Mouri.

124
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:39,377
I hope you know

125
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,277
who killed Mr. Itakura!

126
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,478
Yes. Mr. Itakura himself told me.

127
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:55,477
Hey, don't tell me that you heard the voice of the corpse?

128
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:56,777
No way.

129
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,178
His ankle.

130
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:02,177
Inspector, you saw it too, didn't you?

131
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:06,378
Only Mr. Itakura's right ankle had no traces of socks being worn.

132
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,077
That's because the killer who came back to this room

133
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,777
after Mr. Itakura died,

134
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,377
thought that just one foot wearing a sock

135
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:20,178
would look unnatural and put in back on him.

136
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:26,677
Now, why did Mr. Itakura have to be barefooted?

137
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,377
Why?

138
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:31,877
It's because unless he is barefooted,

139
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,277
he couldn't grab a certain thing or order of something.

140
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,678
Grab something? Grab what?

141
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:42,978
Could it be...

142
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:44,978
Yes.

143
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:49,577
Mr. Itakura used the time he had before his heart medicine wore out

144
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:53,377
and wrote the following with his right foot.

145
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:56,377
A dying message

146
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,878
that indicates who the killer is.

147
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,642
This is his dying message?

148
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:10,142
What on earth is written?

149
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,042
It looks nothing more than an incomplete game of Igo.

150
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:17,542
Inspector, please help me,

151
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:20,242
so that I can explain it simply and clearly.

152
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,642
Officer Takagi. Please give the disc with the diary inside

153
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:29,142
and the unopened disc that was in Mr. Itakura's bag to the inspector.

154
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,242
All right.

155
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:32,842
After that,

156
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:37,243
please sit at the desk where the laptop computer is, inspector.

157
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:47,442
But what does this have to do with the dying message?

158
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,342
I'll explain later.

159
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:52,742
Will you please boot up the computer first of all?

160
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:55,843
Boot up?

161
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:04,343
Boot up.

162
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:12,243
Boot up?

163
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,442
Boot...

164
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:17,442
up.

165
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:22,443
Inspector, to boot means to start the computer.

166
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,843
I'm just joking, I'm joking.

167
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:32,642
Next, move the data of the diary onto the desktop,

168
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,742
and put that into the empty disc.

169
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:38,742
Open it, move it and put it in?

170
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,242
Oh, so all you have to do is copy the data

171
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,242
of the diary into the empty disc.

172
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:45,543
Like so.

173
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:51,342
"Copying from Disk to Desktop"

174
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,542
"Complete"

175
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,542
Hey, Mouri.

176
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,042
Don't tell me that you're doing this

177
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,342
to make fun of me not being digital minded.

178
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,043
And then finally, please turn the computer off.

179
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,843
I can do that.

180
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,542
Why?

181
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,942
What's the matter?

182
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,242
Oh, that's...

183
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:14,643
Don't help him, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:19,043
These electronic goods, I tell you...

185
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:23,943
You do this, and they all switch off!

186
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,742
You shouldn't pull the plug out abruptly like that!

187
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:32,142
Doing so may destroy the data within the computer

188
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,642
or cause damage.

189
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:38,442
But it didn't switch off even if I pushed the switch.

190
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:39,742
For safety reasons,

191
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:41,842
it's made so that you have to push the button for a while

192
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:44,542
before the computer switches off.

193
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,242
That's right.

194
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,742
That is a prohibited strategy

195
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:51,242
that computer users should not do.

196
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:55,642
And words like "boot" and "open"

197
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,642
are terms that are incomprehensible

198
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,742
unless the person uses the computer on a daily basis.

199
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:05,243
You've already figured out what's written on that Igo board, haven't you?

200
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,642
Do you understand?

201
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:13,943
No.

202
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,143
Isn't there something strange about this Igo stone?

203
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,242
What's strange about it?

204
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,642
Because when playing Igo,

205
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:26,442
if you surround your opponent's stone, you've got to take it,

206
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:30,642
and to leave a stone surrounded is a prohibited strategy.

207
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,342
Prohibited strategy?

208
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:35,842
There is some meaning to this Igo stone after all.

209
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:38,043
But, what could it be?

210
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:45,242
Okay, while everyone is distracted with their attention on the Igo stone,

211
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,542
I'll take out the disc with the copy of the diary.

212
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,543
What are you doing, Conan?

213
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,742
Ran.

214
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:55,242
Hey, didn't you hide something just now?

215
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:57,242
I didn't hide anything.

216
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,242
What are you doing then?

217
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:03,042
I thought they sort of looked like Igo stones.

218
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:07,243
The strange patterns on the seals that are pasted onto the keyboard.

219
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:11,543
Patterns? Isn't this Braille?

220
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,042
Come to think of it,

221
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:18,842
Mr. Itakura's vision, just like mine was getting pretty bad,

222
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,742
so he told me he was learning Braille.

223
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,742
Braille?

224
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,142
I get it!

225
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:26,342
So this is what Mr. Mouri was referring to when he said,

226
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:29,042
"Words that only people who know can understand".

227
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,443
Could this be Braille?

228
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,743
What do you think?

229
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,542
No. No form of Braille looks like this.

230
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:44,042
Oh, but if you ignore the white stones, it's readable.

231
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,342
And?

232
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,942
Well, it said,

233
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:50,742
"The killer is...

234
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,443
Soma".

235
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:57,542
"The evidence is

236
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:00,442
the watch."

237
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:01,742
Mr. Soma.

238
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,842
No way. Are you the killer?

239
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:08,142
Hey, how come it turns out like that?

240
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:11,642
Maybe somebody's trying to frame me or something.

241
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,442
No, you're the killer.

242
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:17,142
The reason is that you don't know about Igo nor Braille.

243
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:18,842
Therefore, the killer is the one

244
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,642
who still has conclusive evidence on him,

245
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,342
that's you, Mr. Soma...

246
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:24,342
Wait a minute, Mouri.

247
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:26,242
Don't talk so fast,

248
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:29,742
and please explain things in order as you usually do.

249
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:33,842
The reason why he's the killer and the evidence that shows he is.

250
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:36,842
Don't rush things. Cool head.

251
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:40,143
The copy of the diary is already in my hands.

252
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:44,543
Cool head, cool head.

253
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:51,842
Right, when Mr. Itakura left this dying message,

254
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,542
this is probably what he thought.

255
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:59,742
That the killer would return to this room for sure after he died

256
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,242
in order to undo the masking tape that is wrapped up in.

257
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,342
That's why he used this code

258
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:10,043
that Mr. Soma wouldn't be able to read or even suspect.

259
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,042
And besides, if his corpse is found,

260
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:16,542
you three would be questioned by the police

261
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,243
and it is certain that you will be shown the picture of this Igo Board.

262
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:26,442
He figured that Mr. Naito whose vision is bad enough

263
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,842
to have to trace the Braille in the elevator,

264
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,742
would read the Braille code

265
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:34,142
and that Mr. Sugai who asked him to make the Igo software

266
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,342
would think the prohibited strategy strange,

267
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:39,643
and that he would realize that this is some kind of code.

268
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,842
I see.

269
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:44,642
What about the watch which is the evidence?

270
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:48,543
The watch that Mr. Soma still has on him.

271
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,842
Mr. Itakura disappeared

272
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:56,342
and confined himself to this room a week ago.

273
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:58,942
Mr. Itakura is really finicky when it comes to watches

274
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,342
and has bad vision.

275
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:04,142
When you first came into this room,

276
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:07,742
I'm sure Mr. Itakura naturally took it and looked at it.

277
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:12,043
The wristwatch that is your pride and joy.

278
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,642
I see.

279
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:15,542
If his fingerprints are on the wristwatch

280
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,942
that would be evidence.

281
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,342
Yes.

282
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:20,242
Mr. Itakura who has turned corpse

283
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,642
and meets his killer again after a week,

284
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,142
could not have touched Mr. Soma's watch

285
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,243
that was bought 5 days ago.

286
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:33,342
Mr. Soma,

287
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,742
could we have the forensic officers check your wristwatch then?

288
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:40,942
Yes, go on and check it.

289
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:44,943
I'm sure that his prints will be found all over the place.

290
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:49,242
I put a sleeping drug into his wine

291
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:52,142
while he was absorbed in this wristwatch,

292
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:56,043
put him to sleep and wrapped him tightly with masking tape.

293
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:02,242
20 years ago, when he was a no-name game creator

294
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:06,242
and I was a green-horn that just entered the game company,

295
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:10,243
we were shogi pals who used to go to play shogi together.

296
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:13,743
We used to talk a lot while drinking together.

297
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,842
And we talked of making a shogi software

298
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:21,443
that would outdo the masters of shogi when we became big shots.

299
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,142
But three days ago, when I finally found where he was,

300
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:29,442
he said to me as I walked into his room,

301
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:34,043
"How many times do you think we should allow a person to call wait?"

302
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,542
What a laugh, don't you think?

303
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:40,142
I collected cash from the master play games

304
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,442
and kept sending it to him for 20 years.

305
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,942
And all I had to go on were his words, "The time is ripe".

306
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:49,242
I went into a great amount of debt investing in him, too.

307
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,142
And yet, he has the nerve to say, "Wait"

308
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,842
to a real master of shogi software

309
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,242
that was supposed to have been completed.

310
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,442
I told him I was going to get some wine to energize him

311
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:01,242
and left the room.

312
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:05,643
I bought some sleeping drug and masking tape along with the wine.

313
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:12,842
I didn't refuse your offer to make Kogoro Mouri search for him

314
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:17,142
because I wanted to avoid being suspected even slightly later.

315
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:20,442
After all, I used to talk stink about Itakura at the company a lot

316
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:23,242
because he wouldn't get to making the shogi software

317
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:27,442
but became famous as a computer graphics designer.

318
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:33,242
But 20 years was much too long a wait for both of us.

319
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:35,042
Being apart changes people...

320
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:39,043
Their hearts, their dreams. Everything.

321
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:44,242
If I can call "wait" to life,

322
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:46,943
I'd like to go back to 20 years ago.

323
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:53,543
To the time when we both held the same dream.

324
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,742
See you, Ran.

325
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:33,242
I still have some things to talk over with this groggy father of yours here

326
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:35,142
so if you're going home, hail a cab or something and...

327
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:38,342
No, because it only takes about 30 minutes to walk home from here.

328
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:41,043
Bye, inspector!

329
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:04,243
I have it. It's right here.

330
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:10,743
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

331
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:14,642
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

332
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:17,342
and check this disk thoroughly.

333
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,043
Conan?

334
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,543
I wonder if people change.

335
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:29,343
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

336
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:36,642
It's kind of tough

337
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:38,843
to just keep on waiting.

338
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,542
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

339
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:46,642
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

340
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:50,243
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

341
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:56,343
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

342
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:05,543
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

343
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:09,942
Ran, that's not it.

344
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:11,342
I...

345
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:13,842
Actually, I am...

346
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:16,243
No. I can't tell her.

347
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:20,742
Not until I disclose their identity.

348
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:24,142
Until I crush them.

349
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:27,443
I can't tell anybody about me.

350
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,543
You're...

351
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:02,442
"Next Episode" -This disc with Mr. Itakura's diary in it...

352
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,942
I'm going to check it thoroughly

353
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,142
and figure out

354
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,143
their purpose,

355
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:12,843
as well as their identity.

356
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,842
Two years ago...

357
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:17,742
There. This is it.

358
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:20,342
This is...

359
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,242
Wrong, Dr. Agasa.

360
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,642
Next Conan,

361
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:27,943
"Contact with the Black Organization (Negotiation Edition)"
