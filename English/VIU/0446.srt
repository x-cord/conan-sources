1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,533
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:04,433
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:06,133
An eerie villa with a story behind it.

4
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:09,233
What is the silhouette that appears in the window that is closed off?

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,633
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,333
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,234
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,358
Sonoko.

9
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,058
Stone-paper-scissors...

10
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,457
Me, again?

11
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,857
Sorry.

12
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,557
Be patient for 10 minutes more.

13
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,457
You didn't invite me here

14
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,958
knowing I'm not good at playing stone-paper-scissors, did you?

15
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:19,457
To make up for your efforts,

16
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,058
I want you to make yourself at home later at the Suzuki family villa.

17
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,957
Your villa?

18
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,557
Wasn't it a pension owned by your sister's friend?

19
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:32,957
Huh? Did I say that?

20
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,857
Don't tell me that

21
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:39,557
it's that villa where the murder of the bandaged man occurred?

22
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,458
I still remember that case, too.

23
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,357
No way! I'm going home!

24
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,457
Impossible.

25
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,257
You have no sense of direction, do you?

26
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:50,358
But...

27
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,657
I see why Sonoko sent the car back halfway

28
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,457
and made us all walk the mountain road up to the villa.

29
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:02,457
This way, Ran wouldn't be able to leave after getting scared.

30
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,158
Sonoko, that fool.

31
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,657
By the way, has the case been solved?

32
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,257
Absolutely solved. Thanks to Deduction Queen Sonoko.

33
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,557
Right, since that case,

34
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:20,158
you've been solving cases like my dad, as if you were sleeping.

35
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,657
And when I was assaulted by the Bandaged Man,

36
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:26,858
Conan helped me out.

37
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,957
So he was at the site, too.

38
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,158
Well, I will tell you the details after we arrive at the villa.

39
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,257
I can't believe it!

40
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,558
The bridge!

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,558
Don't tell me someone is up to no good again.

42
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:51,557
No, it must have collapsed from the base.

43
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,557
This is simply a cheat in construction work.

44
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,257
Is it?

45
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:57,257
But we're in trouble.

46
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:59,457
We can't reach the villa.

47
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,257
The car already left.

48
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:04,357
My sister and the others will be coming, but that's tonight.

49
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:06,357
Then, let's call them by cell phone.

50
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:07,857
I'm sure they'll come right away.

51
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:09,457
Sorry,

52
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,157
but this place is outside of the cell phone service range.

53
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:12,957
No way.

54
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,857
Then let's do this.

55
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,957
Let's go to that villa and borrow the phone there.

56
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
There may be someone inside.

57
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:29,358
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 1)"

58
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:36,358
Looks like no one's home.

59
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,058
Who are you people?

60
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:54,157
Oh, you mean the bridge leading to that villa?

61
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,957
Come to think of it, it's broken.

62
00:05:55,958 --> 00:06:00,057
Yes. I would like to use your phone and call someone to come pick us up.

63
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,257
"Jun Makino (29)" -No problem.

64
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:04,557
You can kill time here till they come.

65
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,857
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

66
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:10,057
This is a very nice villa.

67
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:14,657
Your remark should go to the rich man who built this.

68
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:18,357
"Toru Tendou (30)" -We just beat down the price of it and got it.

69
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,057
We're just ordinary citizens.

70
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,357
You bought this for a cheap price?

71
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,757
Yes. We're members of a band.

72
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,757
In other words, musicians.

73
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:32,257
I was looking for a place where I could write music and lyrics in peace.

74
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,258
That was when we found this rarity.

75
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:39,557
But it must've cost a lot, despite it being a good buy.

76
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:42,057
No, it was really cheap.

77
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,957
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Something about this place having a story behind it.

78
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,358
They were planning to demolish it if they couldn't sell it.

79
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,557
-A story behind it? -A story behind it?

80
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:51,657
Right.

81
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,657
Originally, multimillionaire brothers seem to have built this place.

82
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,657
They would bring their wives here around this time

83
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:58,658
every year to avoid the heat.

84
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,957
But one night, when it was raining heavily,

85
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,858
the older brother started saying something strange.

86
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,757
"I saw an unidentifiable devil come in from the window."

87
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,957
A...

88
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,158
Devil?

89
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:30,958
After that, they nailed the window and closed it off immediately.

90
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,758
No good. The devil has already...

91
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,057
possessed this place!

92
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:44,857
The older brother later refurbished this villa.

93
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,157
He changed the floors, the wallpapers and renewed everything.

94
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,257
But one year after the refurbishing the house,

95
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:54,257
the first incident occurred.

96
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,257
Incident?

97
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,557
It involved the older brother's wife.

98
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,257
While she was gardening,

99
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,257
she saw something.

100
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:05,957
From the window that was supposed to be sealed,

101
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,358
something was staring at her.

102
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,057
What was it?

103
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,557
Was it the devil?

104
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:14,758
Maybe.

105
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,557
A few days later,

106
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:21,457
she was almost possessed by the devil.

107
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,057
She used a rope and killed herself in her room.

108
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:28,657
Even the older brother, as if he were chasing after her,

109
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:32,157
killed himself by jumping from the window of his room on the third floor.

110
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,557
After that, only the younger brother and his wife stayed at this villa.

111
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,758
This is why it was so cheap.

112
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,857
Well?

113
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:47,457
Don't you think this is a good place to create good music and lyrics?

114
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,157
Yeah.

115
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:52,157
Hey, hey. What kind of music is it?

116
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:56,057
But does that window really unable to be opened?

117
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:59,658
Go check it out yourself. Come.

118
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:07,658
I see.

119
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,858
The window has been nailed shut.

120
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,357
It won't budge an inch.

121
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:15,657
See?

122
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,957
When we bought it, they told us that they would fix the window,

123
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,057
but we left it as it is, because we thought it was a sheer waste.

124
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,657
You should have had it fixed.

125
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,557
Want to stay overnight?

126
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:28,257
You may be able to see the devil.

127
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:29,657
No, thank you.

128
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:32,057
We just want to use your phone.

129
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,257
I'm glad you all came back as we were leaving.

130
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:39,157
What? We went out to buy some food.

131
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:42,157
But one person should have been here. Rinko.

132
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,458
Rinko?

133
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,357
"Rinko Honami (28)" -Hey.

134
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:51,257
Can't you all be quiet around here?

135
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,858
How can I write songs like this?

136
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,057
That's Rinko.

137
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,657
She uses the room next door.

138
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:01,257
Since she came here, she has always been acting like that.

139
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:02,657
Always irritated.

140
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:06,957
We can't complain, because the life of our band "Dorcus"

141
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,357
depends on the music she makes.

142
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,357
What? Did you say "Dorcus"?

143
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,957
I know you!

144
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,357
You're well known among the Indies, aren't you?

145
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:16,757
I even have one of your CDs!

146
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,257
Oh, thanks a lot.

147
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,758
I wonder which way.

148
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,357
Here you are.

149
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,857
I finally talked to my sister.

150
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,057
She told me she can get here in two hours or so and pick us up.

151
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,657
Great!

152
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,157
Okay. Then...

153
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,957
Let's go out to the backyard while waiting for her, shall we?

154
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,357
I want to see the window from outside.

155
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,058
The window where the devil supposedly looked in through.

156
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:45,157
The window is the fourth one from the right on the second floor.

157
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,457
That one.

158
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,457
From the outside, it looks like an ordinary window.

159
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,657
It doesn't look all that haunted.

160
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,157
Was the devil really looking through the window?

161
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,458
They say so.

162
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,257
Look. There's a bird's nest up there.

163
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:05,557
I see it, too.

164
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:07,658
Be careful, Conan.

165
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,857
There's nothing inside.

166
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,558
It doesn't look like birds built a nest here either.

167
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:19,057
But there is a white plate in here.

168
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,157
Strange to find a plate in a birdhouse, isn't it?

169
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,857
What? Let me see it.

170
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,558
You'd better not, Eisuke.

171
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:32,157
It hurts...

172
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,557
You are really a klutz, aren't you?

173
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:35,858
Are you okay?

174
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,257
I guess I am okay.

175
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:42,458
Now, let's move toward the terrace.

176
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:45,758
What is it this time?

177
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:47,858
What's that?

178
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,657
Something's up there.

179
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:58,957
Something was gazing at us from the sealed window!

180
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,257
Come on.

181
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:03,257
Did you hit your head or something when you fell down a while ago?

182
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:05,357
No, I'm not lying!

183
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,358
Conan?

184
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:19,258
What's up, kid?

185
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,057
It's completely sealed.

186
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,058
There are no traces of nails being removed either.

187
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,957
Rinko.

188
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,557
Hey, Rinko.

189
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,257
Hurry and open the door.

190
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,857
Rinko.

191
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:42,957
What's going on?

192
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,157
I bought a CD that Rinko asked me to buy for her,

193
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,757
when I went out to buy food a while ago.

194
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,958
I wanted to give it to her, but she's not answering the door.

195
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,857
She looked annoyed just now.

196
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,058
So maybe she sulked out and went to sleep?

197
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,187
Hey!

198
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,287
Rinko!

199
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:11,788
-Rinko! -Rinko!

200
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,387
Hey!

201
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,887
Rinko!

202
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,487
What's the matter, Rinko?

203
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:19,887
Rinko!

204
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:22,187
Rinko!

205
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,587
I got the CD you asked for.

206
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:26,288
Open the door. Hey!

207
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,587
Something's wrong.

208
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,687
We're making this much noise.

209
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,387
Knowing Rinko, she would be coming out like a while ago.

210
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,688
How can I write songs like this?

211
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:41,287
Well, I guess...

212
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,688
Something's wrong after all.

213
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:48,487
No good. I can't see well.

214
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,987
You try it, will you, kid?

215
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,188
Okay.

216
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:59,087
Do you have a small mirror?

217
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,088
What? Yes.

218
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,088
What's this?

219
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,787
What's up, Toru?

220
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:18,987
What's wrong?

221
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,087
I can see her feet.

222
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,188
They're suspended.

223
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,588
Hey, does that mean...

224
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:29,888
-One, two, three. -One, two, three.

225
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:45,688
Rinko!

226
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,887
It can't be! Why, Rinko?

227
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,787
First, lie her down.

228
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,988
Ask for an ambulance and police.

229
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:03,687
The room seems to be locked completely.

230
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,387
And that key

231
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,588
must've come from the key holder on her hip.

232
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,887
Those...

233
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:14,787
Those are the keys for her car, bicycle and car.

234
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:19,287
The black cover is probably an electronic key for the house.

235
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,587
Then the key to this room...

236
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,588
Where is it?

237
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:33,688
Here it is!

238
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:40,287
But the door and the window are all locked.

239
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:43,187
This room seems to be completely closed off.

240
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,188
Is this really a suicide?

241
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,387
No good.

242
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,988
She is not breathing.

243
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,387
That means the one staring at us

244
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:57,287
from the sealed window earlier

245
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,087
must be the devil!

246
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,587
What?

247
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:03,187
Don't tell me you really saw it?

248
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,287
Yes.

249
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:06,587
Not us. Eisuke's the one who saw it.

250
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:07,787
I'm sure.

251
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,587
It was a few minutes ago in the backyard.

252
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:11,187
You!

253
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,987
Are you sure you were not half asleep?

254
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,587
I am telling the truth!

255
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:17,087
It was dark so I couldn't really see it clearly,

256
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:20,187
but I'm sure that something was looking out the window.

257
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,187
Are you sure your glasses weren't dirty?

258
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,687
Come on.

259
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,987
But, if what he said is true,

260
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:31,487
maybe something is living here.

261
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,187
Because this room is the one

262
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:37,488
where the wife of the older brother killed herself.

263
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:46,287
Anyway, let's carry Rinko to the sofa.

264
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,588
It's too pitiful to let Rinko lying on the cold floor.

265
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,788
Hey, you're stepping on the keys.

266
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:54,888
Sorry, Rinko.

267
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:07,687
I see.

268
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:10,387
Let me sort out the circumstances.

269
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:15,587
You wanted to give the CD that Rinko asked you to get for her.

270
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,487
You knocked the door, but no one answered.

271
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,587
Everyone sensed that something was wrong.

272
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,087
When you looked into through the opening of the door,

273
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,087
you saw her feet suspended in the air.

274
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:27,487
You broke through the locked door and went inside.

275
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:31,687
Then you found Rinko dead in this condition, right?

276
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,287
Yes.

277
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:35,887
Then who has the key for this room?

278
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,387
The key holder is on her hip.

279
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:42,388
The key was on the keyboard.

280
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:50,787
This is the key for this room, isn't it?

281
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:53,187
Don't you have any spare keys?

282
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,387
No, that's all there is.

283
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,487
But someone could've made a spare key secretly.

284
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,087
No way.

285
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:04,587
When we bought this house, Rinko changed all locks to the rooms.

286
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:05,687
And...

287
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:08,988
She handed a key to each of us herself.

288
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:14,987
So after you broke the door and entered,

289
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:18,387
could someone have locked the window in secret?

290
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,187
No way.

291
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:23,387
The only one who walked around this room

292
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,587
is that boy over there.

293
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:29,487
All windows were locked.

294
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:32,587
You didn't mess with the windows, right?

295
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:35,487
Thus, the door was locked and the window was closed, too.

296
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:38,087
The room was completely closed.

297
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:41,787
So this is nothing other than suicide.

298
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,787
Excuse me.

299
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:46,988
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

300
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:52,488
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

301
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,388
And the murderer is among you.

302
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,788
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

303
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,087
Huh?

304
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,387
Where is Mr. Mouri?

305
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,488
He's not here.

306
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,787
Why not?

307
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:14,587
Even though Ran, Conan and you, with the glasses are all here?

308
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,487
Why isn't he here?

309
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,088
Don't ask me.

310
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:23,887
Hey.

311
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:27,787
Why are you sure that this is a locked-room murder, officer?

312
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:31,187
It would be hard for other people, but for we police officers,

313
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,088
we can tell right away just by looking at this chair.

314
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,187
In the case of suicide using a rope,

315
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:40,687
the person usually kicks the chair down.

316
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,187
But in this case,

317
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:45,287
the chair is left standing and moreover, it is right under the rope.

318
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:47,487
In other words, someone strangled Rinko,

319
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:51,187
killed her and suspended her corpse in the air. This is the evidence.

320
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:55,687
Sir, the chair was placed there after we broke the door

321
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,687
and entered this room.

322
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,787
Why?

323
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,387
To bring down Rinko.

324
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:05,187
We thought she was still alive.

325
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,487
Besides, when we entered the room,

326
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:10,087
if I remember correctly, the chair was lying on the floor.

327
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,187
Is that right?

328
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,088
Then, this case is undoubtedly suicide.

329
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:17,888
It can't be helped, then.

330
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:22,787
What is this?

331
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,488
This is interesting!

332
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,687
Conan, what are you doing?

333
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,087
Stop it!

334
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:32,788
It has a ruler on it and looks like a tape measure!

335
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,588
Hey, stop that!

336
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:40,588
This key holder sure stretches pretty far, doesn't it?

337
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,487
Rinko told me it's an interesting gadget

338
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:48,387
that can also be used as a tape measure.

339
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:51,388
Something about it stretching about five meters.

340
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,587
Handy, isn't it?

341
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:57,187
Handy? Is that all?

342
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:58,887
Hey, Ran.

343
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:01,787
If you've got a key on the key holder that can be extended that far,

344
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:04,788
you can open the door of this room from far away, too.

345
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,787
You're not so smart, Conan.

346
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,487
You can't open a door that far

347
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:14,587
unless you can extend your arm that far, don't you think?

348
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,287
No, that's not it.

349
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:17,487
Wait a minute.

350
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:21,087
If the key to this room is on that key holder...

351
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,187
That's right.

352
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,088
This room can be closed from outside.

353
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:30,087
Look at the distance between the place where Rinko was and the door.

354
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,287
If it's this distance,

355
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,187
the key holder on Rinko's hip can be extended

356
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,287
and pulled through the space under the door.

357
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,288
The culprit leaves and locked the room.

358
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:44,788
When the culprit let go...

359
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,487
it automatically springs back

360
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,987
and returns to Rinko's key holder on her hip.

361
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:55,988
But the key to this room was removed from the key holder.

362
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:59,487
Before Rinko killed herself,

363
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:01,787
she might have tried to erase the possibility of a murder

364
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,287
for fear that she might get her friends into trouble.

365
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,487
Or...

366
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:08,187
it may be that someone killed Rinko and made it look like suicide

367
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:14,087
and then destroyed the evidence pointing to it being a murder?

368
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,487
I see.

369
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:17,087
Wait a minute.

370
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,787
Are you saying that there is a murderer among us?

371
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:20,987
Cut it out!

372
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:21,988
You have to be joking!

373
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:00,287
"Next Episode" -Maybe...

374
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:05,388
something may have possessed you three, too!

375
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:10,387
I thought so.

376
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:11,988
There's a slot to slide the plate in.

377
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,388
Something suddenly hits me.

378
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:28,388
Next Conan, "Sealed Western-style Window (Part 2)"

379
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,287
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,687
"The order the books are placed."

381
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,687
Next week, I will be solving the case!

382
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,288
I wonder if everything's going to turn out okay?
