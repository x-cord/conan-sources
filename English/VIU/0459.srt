1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:01,356
Commotion!

2
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:04,856
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:06,956
A man who is strict about rules versus a woman who is not.

4
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:08,656
A tragedy occurs between the two.

5
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:10,156
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:11,656
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:14,056
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,836
Are you really going to go look at it?

9
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:04,236
Yes, for your sake, Genta!

10
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:08,236
Geez. What a curiosity seeker.

11
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:12,136
We only found out about that person a day ago.

12
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:16,936
"Yesterday" -Oh, that doesn't go there, Kojima.

13
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,036
Oh, rats...

14
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,936
Unburnable trash...

15
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:25,236
Genta, make sure you sort the trash correctly!

16
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:28,236
Stupid, I just made a careless mistake.

17
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:31,336
You're too careless, Genta.

18
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,536
Oh...

19
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,836
If Mr. Iwata were here,

20
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:36,436
you'd be getting lectured for at least 30 minutes.

21
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,236
Who's Mr. Iwata?

22
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,736
A man who lives in our apartment.

23
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:44,136
Oh, that's right, your family runs an apartment.

24
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:49,836
Yes, Mr. Iwao Iwata who moved in about three months ago,

25
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,636
is super strict when it comes to throwing away trash.

26
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,036
If you throw the trash out at a strange time,

27
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:55,936
or dispose of trash without sorting it out,

28
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:57,736
he finds out who did it

29
00:02:57,736 --> 00:03:01,436
and brings the trash bag back to that person.

30
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:04,436
Oh, isn't that taking things a bit too far?

31
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:07,036
He's really serious and extremely neat.

32
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,336
Yes, he's a very fine man.

33
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:13,236
Rather, he's quite a weirdo.

34
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,436
That's right!

35
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:18,536
Let's go see that man called Mr. Iwao Iwata tomorrow.

36
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,136
Go visit him?

37
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,136
Let's go see the person who's serious and neat

38
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,236
so that you can follow him as an example, Genta.

39
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,736
What?

40
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:28,036
Hey...

41
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,936
So, we end up coming...

42
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,336
-Good morning. -Good morning!

43
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:38,336
He's Mr. Iwao Iwata.

44
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:40,936
You're the one who put out this trash bag, aren't you?

45
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,336
A direct mail addressed to you is inside.

46
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,436
Don't look into other people's trash bag!

47
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,836
"Iwao Iwata (30)" -It's wet with rain

48
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:48,536
so you threw it out last night.

49
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,236
Trash is supposed to be thrown out in the morning.

50
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,536
Why don't you follow the rules?

51
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,936
This man is exactly as Chiharu said.

52
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:04,436
"The Abominable Man of Rules"

53
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:09,336
On top of that, kitchen garbage, cans and Styrofoam are mixed in this bag.

54
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,636
Sort your trash like you should!

55
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,036
He sure looks worked up.

56
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,936
He doesn't have to get so furious.

57
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,636
That just goes to show how serious he is.

58
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,836
What?

59
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:25,536
Okay. I will sort it!

60
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,036
You better watch yourself!

61
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,236
If you keep pushing your weight around,

62
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,836
you're really going to get it one of these days!

63
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,236
They're my classmates.

64
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,636
Good morning!

65
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,436
-Good morning! -Good morning!

66
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,036
Morning.

67
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:45,236
Your attitude of cautioning people to stick to the rules of society

68
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,236
was a great learning experience for us too.

69
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:51,036
Well, it's just that somebody's got to do it.

70
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,136
Bye.

71
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:59,136
But why can't he caution the person personally

72
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,036
instead of in front of all those people,

73
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,236
and so exaggeratedly too.

74
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,236
There's a reason

75
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:08,436
why Mr. Iwata became so strict about throwing trash out.

76
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,836
What reason?

77
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,236
Soon after Mr. Iwata moved in,

78
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,936
the apartment was struck by an arsonist.

79
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,036
Arson?

80
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,236
The arsonist burned the trash

81
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,136
that someone had thrown out in the middle of the night

82
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,636
without following the rules.

83
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:28,536
Mr. Iwata happened to notice it and extinguished the fire

84
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,036
so we were lucky, but...

85
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:36,936
And that's why he became really strict about throwing out trash.

86
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,236
But like the man that he just razzed,

87
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:42,436
if he's too hung up on rules and repeated about it,

88
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,136
people around him are going to start hating him.

89
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,636
That's what you call repaying kindness with resentment.

90
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,436
Right, Conan?

91
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,936
Conan?

92
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:51,436
Yeah.

93
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:54,536
Then, three days later, an incident occurs.

94
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:57,336
"Three days later" -Homicide?

95
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:58,836
Mr. Iwata...

96
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:01,536
Didn't I tell you that he was going to be hated?

97
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,136
But, it can't be...

98
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,336
No way!

99
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:07,836
Poor thing, he was just trying to do the right thing...

100
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:10,436
No, it's the other way around!

101
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,536
Mr. Iwata is the assaulter...

102
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:13,536
-What? -What?

103
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,036
He is?

104
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:24,036
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

105
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,036
Oh, you guys.

106
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,336
What is it?

107
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:30,336
Is it true that Mr. Iwao Iwata really kill somebody?

108
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,836
Is it really true?

109
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:35,136
Do you guys know him?

110
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,436
Yes. So tell us the details!

111
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:40,236
It's true that he assaulted somebody.

112
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:43,236
A woman, over how to throw trash out.

113
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,036
-What? -Over how to throw trash out?

114
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,236
"Interrogation room" -Over how to throw trash out?

115
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:49,336
Last night...

116
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:53,236
Rather, at about 3 am in the wee hours of the morning today.

117
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:57,436
I got thirsty so I was drinking water in the kitchen.

118
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,736
When I happened to look out the window

119
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,836
and notice someone taking trash out.

120
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,336
I couldn't stand not doing anything so I...

121
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,736
So, it's you again.

122
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,136
I thought I told you that you shouldn't bring your trash out at night,

123
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,136
just the other day too!

124
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,436
I cautioned her then she said...

125
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,036
Get off my back.

126
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,836
Stop playing Mr. Goody-goody all by yourself!

127
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,936
She came at me with an iron pipe that was at her feet.

128
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,136
I never liked you from before.

129
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:24,836
I thought that I'd be killed

130
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:28,836
unless I took the iron pipe away from her so I...

131
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,336
Are you all right?

132
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,436
Hey...

133
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:39,536
Oh, no...

134
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,536
But he turned himself in to the police right after that.

135
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:46,636
So, rather than a case of homicide...

136
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:48,636
Right.

137
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,036
I admit to have killed her.

138
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,936
But, officer, I did so in self-defense.

139
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:57,736
Yes! I'm sure he did it in self-defense!

140
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,836
If it's as Mr. Iwata says.

141
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,036
Self-defense?

142
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:05,436
What happens if he did it in self-defense?

143
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,336
He won't be charged for homicide, right?

144
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,136
He won't be charged?

145
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,436
But, it happened after midnight so...

146
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:16,536
We're looking for eye-witnesses too but so far nothing.

147
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:18,436
In other words, it's difficult to prove

148
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,336
that the victim actually suddenly attacked him

149
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:23,236
with the iron pipe.

150
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,836
You mean you suspect him?

151
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:28,536
We can't just take his side of the story for fact.

152
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:30,036
We've got to find something to back it up...

153
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:33,236
He's a really serious person

154
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,636
and not someone who would lie.

155
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,836
Yes!

156
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:37,936
I think so too.

157
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:41,336
But if he really felt that his life was in danger,

158
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,236
why didn't he flee?

159
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,336
That's the part that bothers me too...

160
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:48,136
It's strange that a person who is carrying out justice

161
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,836
runs from a person who is doing something wrong!

162
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,236
Logically I guess you could say so, but...

163
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,536
It seems that the victim was always not too concerned

164
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,136
about the rules of how trash should be thrown away.

165
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,036
You mean the woman who passed away?

166
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:01,536
Yes. Her name was Ms. Misa Katayama

167
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:04,236
and she lived alone in that condominium.

168
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:07,236
She worked as a hostess at a snack bar,

169
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,036
so she always came home after midnight.

170
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,236
She seems to have thrown her trash out at night

171
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:14,136
because she used to be asleep in the morning.

172
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,536
The community committee leader also seems to have cautioned her before.

173
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:22,136
Ms. Katayama, please adhere to the rules.

174
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:25,036
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

175
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,236
I mean all the fuss about throwing away rubbish at night.

176
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,936
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

177
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,636
and get them to arrest me.

178
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:34,736
It seems that the community committee leader

179
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,736
couldn't do anything about it either.

180
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:40,036
That's when Mr. Iwata moved in

181
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,636
and cautioned her repeatedly about trash

182
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:47,336
that Ms. Misa Katayama seemed to dislike him.

183
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,636
So, it's exactly as Iwata had testified...

184
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:52,636
Isn't this the result of a tragedy that occurred impulsively

185
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,436
because a woman who doesn't give a hoot about rules

186
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,936
and a man who is hung up on rules,

187
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:00,636
just happened to live in the same neighborhood?

188
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:03,036
I wonder if that's what it was?

189
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,736
For now, the only foothold we have is his testimony.

190
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,136
I'll go check on his character

191
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,636
to see if he is one we can trust or not.

192
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,436
It seems it's only been three months

193
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:15,636
since he moved to this apartment but...

194
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,536
I'll check further back in the past.

195
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,636
I'll go look for eye-witnesses.

196
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:25,336
If we can make apparent what a decent citizen Mr. Iwata really is,

197
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:28,036
I'm sure his killing in self-defense will be proven!

198
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,936
If he really did it in self-defense.

199
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:35,736
I guess they're going to come with me even if I tell them not to.

200
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,636
Mr. Iwata's personality?

201
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,436
For example, is he the type that lies?

202
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:45,136
No way... Not Mr. Iwata.

203
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,736
He would never lie.

204
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,636
He's a decent citizen that isn't two-faced.

205
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,436
See, it's just a waste of time, Officer Takagi.

206
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:54,136
Yeah...

207
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:57,936
Did he used to get into trouble with people for not following rules

208
00:10:57,936 --> 00:10:59,836
when he was living here too?

209
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,836
He would never get into trouble with anyone

210
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:04,936
because he's a mild mannered person.

211
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,636
Something's not right...

212
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,536
Because when we saw him the other day,

213
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,536
he was really worked up and shouting off the top of his lungs.

214
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,536
Yes...

215
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,236
I wonder if his personality changed

216
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,936
after he moved to that apartment?

217
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,736
Oh, I was really surprised when he moved out,

218
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:21,436
because it was so sudden...

219
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,936
Sudden?

220
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,836
Well, the rental agreement is renewed every two years

221
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:31,536
and he moved out almost right after he completed renewal procedures.

222
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:32,536
What?

223
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:36,736
In other words, Mr. Iwata was planning to go on living here

224
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,436
but suddenly changed his mind

225
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:42,036
and moved in to the apartment in Beika-cho?

226
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:46,136
Did Mr. Iwata move into an apartment in Beika-cho?

227
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:48,636
Yes, why do you ask?

228
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:52,936
It's nothing. But to move from a condominium to an apartment...

229
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:55,736
He didn't look like he was having money problems.

230
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,736
And, it's more convenient to go to the research lab

231
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,336
that he works at from here too.

232
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:04,936
Maybe something urgent came up three months ago

233
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,436
that he had to move into that apartment.

234
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,436
Yeah. There seems to be no other way to think of it.

235
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:13,536
And because he moved there, the incident occurred.

236
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,436
Hey! Just what does that mean?

237
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,436
Hey! What does it mean?

238
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,736
-Hey! -Hey!

239
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,636
How should I know?

240
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,136
This case most likely is not something

241
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:25,736
that occurred on the spur of the moment after all.

242
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,651
"Sanko Precision Technology Research Institute"

243
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,151
Three months ago?

244
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,551
Yes, do you know if something out of the ordinary came over Mr. Iwata?

245
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,351
Three months ago...

246
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,651
Oh, he's usually a very cheerful person,

247
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:48,151
but he looked to be very troubled about something back then.

248
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,351
I think it was after he went to pay homage

249
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,751
to the grave of his acquaintance.

250
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,051
Pay homage to the grave?

251
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:55,451
Yes... It was the second anniversary of his benefactor's death

252
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,151
who took care of him when he was in school.

253
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,651
Did he go to the grave

254
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:00,651
before he moved in to the apartment he's living in now?

255
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:04,251
Yes, I think he moved out soon after that.

256
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:08,551
That visit to the grave may have triggered him off in some way.

257
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,551
A school days benefactor who he owes his life to...

258
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:14,151
"Inoue Law Office" -Oh, you must mean Mr. Yasaka.

259
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:17,651
Iwata and I were both students who didn't have money

260
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,151
so we worked part-time and barely fed ourselves.

261
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:25,351
Iwata used to work part time at Mr. Yasaka's factory.

262
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,951
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka took care of Iwata,

263
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,651
who had lost his parents at a young age,

264
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:32,951
as if he were their own son.

265
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,451
When he was hit by a motorbike near the factory

266
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,951
and was badly hurt...

267
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,851
If a blood transfusion is needed, please use my blood!

268
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,451
Mine too!

269
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:45,451
The couple both seem to have given him blood.

270
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,451
In other words, that couple saved his life.

271
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,651
Iwata used to say so too.

272
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,751
However, about two years ago,

273
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:57,051
they were deceived by some bad loan shark

274
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,051
who took away their house as well as their factory

275
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:02,351
and the couple committed suicide.

276
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,751
If he said that he was going to visit the grave of someone

277
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,551
who saved his life in his school days,

278
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,951
it must be the grave of that couple.

279
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,351
I'm sure the temple where their grave was is

280
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,451
in Henryu Temple located in Beika-cho.

281
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,651
-What? -What?

282
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,451
Henryu Temple...

283
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,851
That's near your apartment, right, Chiharu?

284
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,151
Yes...

285
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,151
There's Beika Station...

286
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,951
The apartment...

287
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,651
And it's beyond a little way farther.

288
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,851
Where's the loan shark that deceived Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka

289
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:32,351
and drove them to suicide now?

290
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,551
I'm sure he's in jail

291
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:36,351
because he seems to have threatened people for money

292
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,251
and been involved in other crimes.

293
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,351
What about the woman?

294
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,851
The woman?

295
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:44,651
There seems to have been a woman involved too.

296
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,751
"Two Years Ago" -After investigating I found out

297
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,951
that there was a woman who introduced the loan shark Fujikura

298
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:51,251
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's!

299
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:54,151
I'm sure that the woman, conspired with Fujikura

300
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:56,451
to begin with and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

301
00:14:56,451 --> 00:15:00,451
Hey, can't you somehow get that woman to pay for what she did too?

302
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,451
If she says that she introduced them out of goodwill,

303
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,551
that's it...

304
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:06,551
It's too bad, but there's no way she can be tried by law.

305
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:10,051
So, you can't punish that woman by law!

306
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:12,451
Iwata seemed really vexed.

307
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,251
What's that woman's name?

308
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,451
He didn't tell me.

309
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:18,851
I think she was working for a bar or a snack shop or something.

310
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,951
-Which means... -Don't tell me that...

311
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,151
What about that woman?

312
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,951
So, that's the story.

313
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,551
I have something I would like you

314
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,351
to verify with a man called Fujikura

315
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:34,951
who had been serving time since two years ago.

316
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,951
You can't?

317
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,351
He died last month of an illness?

318
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,051
Fujikura?

319
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,751
Eiji Fujikura.

320
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:48,751
Have you ever heard this man's name from Ms. Misa Katayama?

321
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,451
No, I haven't.

322
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,551
I don't have the slightest idea what kind of guy

323
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,151
that nasty woman was going with...

324
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:57,751
But you were working with her, weren't you...

325
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,351
I'm telling you, I don't know!

326
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,351
Yes, this is Takagi.

327
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,851
Thank you just a while ago.

328
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,451
You got verification?

329
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:17,451
Thank you.

330
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,551
It's the prison officer I called a while ago.

331
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:23,551
He asked a person who was serving sentence together with Fujikura.

332
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,451
It seems that Fujikura was saying that once he got out,

333
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,851
he was going to team up with a hostess called Misa

334
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,151
and make loads of cash again.

335
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:33,051
The assaulter and the victim connected, didn't they?

336
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,251
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

337
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:38,451
You have no conclusive proof at all yet!

338
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:39,951
Proof...

339
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,051
Conan!

340
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:47,851
What's with this kid?

341
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,151
-Conan! -Conan!

342
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,351
Is she the person called Ms. Misa Katayama?

343
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:57,551
Yes, but if so, what?

344
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,751
Is this a recent picture?

345
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,151
It's about a half a year ago...

346
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,451
Half a year has already passed...

347
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:07,051
What about this picture?

348
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,751
She's hurt.

349
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:12,251
Yes, right.

350
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,451
She slammed her finger between the car door and it almost came off.

351
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,851
There sure was a great fuss over it.

352
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,051
Everything turned out okay, for the time being though.

353
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,551
For the time being?

354
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:25,051
There's one thing I'd like to verify...

355
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:28,851
Yes. That murder weapon that was confiscated as evidence.

356
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,251
Yes... About that iron pipe...

357
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,651
Although we were trying to save Mr. Iwata,

358
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,751
we seemed to have tracked down something incredible.

359
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,151
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

360
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,551
No matter what the consequences, there is only one truth.

361
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,951
You understand why we asked you to come here,

362
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,451
don't you, Mr. Iwata?

363
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,451
"Yasaka Family's Grave" -Three months ago from now,

364
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,251
you came to visit this grave...

365
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:57,051
The day you came here was

366
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:58,451
the memorial day of the death of Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka,

367
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,851
who killed themselves after being deceived by Eiji Fujikura,

368
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,351
an evil loan shark two years ago.

369
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,351
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka...

370
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:11,651
On your way back to the station after visiting the grave,

371
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:15,151
you coincidentally caught a glimpse of something.

372
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,451
It was the woman who had conspired with Eiji Fujikura

373
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,351
and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

374
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,851
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

375
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,051
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

376
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:28,851
and get them to arrest me?

377
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,051
Despite having driven a good couple to their death,

378
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:37,651
this woman didn't show a tinge of regret.

379
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,851
Isn't that when you thought that having seen her

380
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:43,751
on their memorial day was a work of fate?

381
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,751
And that you would avenge the death of the couple who saved you.

382
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,451
You rented the apartment located opposite the condominium

383
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:53,551
that the woman lived and moved in.

384
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,451
You wanted to avenge their death but didn't want to get caught doing so.

385
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:01,251
Since she was not legally punished by law,

386
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:03,451
you thought up a scheme in which you wouldn't get caught either.

387
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,651
So, you thought up the strategy of killing in self-defense.

388
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:11,351
You carried out your plan right away.

389
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,551
You stared the arson fear.

390
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,151
Using this as a start,

391
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,851
you made everybody believe that you had very strict standards

392
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:19,851
when it came to throwing out trash.

393
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,351
Next, all you had to do was to wait for the chance to come around.

394
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,151
You continued to wait until that woman,

395
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,751
Ms. Misa Katayama, to come out to throw her trash away.

396
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,951
You waited for the perfect chance when there were no witnesses at all.

397
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,051
Oh...

398
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,251
Darn!

399
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:39,751
Then last night the time finally arrived.

400
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,851
You put her fingerprints on the iron pipe

401
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,151
that you brought along with you

402
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:59,251
and turned yourself into the police.

403
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,451
Am I wrong, Mr. Iwata?

404
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,751
You tried to make a planned murder looks as if it happened by chance.

405
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:09,751
Since it looks on the outside to be trouble between the neighbors,

406
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,451
you probably thought that police wouldn't check far back

407
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:16,351
into the past karmic relationship of the victim and assaulter.

408
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:21,351
That woman picked the iron pipe up from the ground

409
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,651
and suddenly attacked me.

410
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:26,351
That's why I had no choice but to...

411
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,651
I did it in self-defense!

412
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:29,851
Enough already.

413
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,951
Yeah.

414
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:32,651
Please stop it already.

415
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,351
We have proof.

416
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,551
It's Ms. Misa Katayama's fingerprints.

417
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,151
Fingerprints?

418
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:40,151
Are you saying that the woman's fingerprints weren't

419
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,951
on the iron pipe or what?

420
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,451
Just the opposite.

421
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,551
The fingerprint of all 10 of Ms. Katayama's fingers were on it.

422
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,751
That person called, Ms. Misa Katayama,

423
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,651
seems to have hurt the finger of her right hand very badly

424
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,251
half a year ago

425
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,651
and to this day cannot bend that finger.

426
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:58,851
What?

427
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:00,851
Unless somebody forced her to grab the pole

428
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,451
and held it down,

429
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:05,951
the fingerprint of that finger couldn't have got onto the pole.

430
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,751
I just couldn't forgive that woman!

431
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,151
I'm alive here today thanks

432
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,251
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's giving me blood.

433
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:23,451
Hey, keep your eyes on what you're doing or you'll get hurt.

434
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:24,551
Okay!

435
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:28,651
I think I'll work here even after graduating from university...

436
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:30,251
Don't be silly!

437
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,051
That's right, Iwata.

438
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,751
You're going to become a technician great enough

439
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,751
to carry Japan on your shoulders.

440
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,951
You idiot, not only Japan but the world!

441
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,051
Right!

442
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:44,851
How could she dare to deceive such a good couple...

443
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:49,351
And to go as far as to drive them to commit suicide...

444
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,451
Regardless, what you have committed is a crime.

445
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:54,751
No matter how much you cannot forgive a person,

446
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:57,751
it does not give you the right to take that person's life.

447
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,951
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka!

448
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,651
Oh, there you are!

449
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,751
What's up, Genta?

450
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:48,751
A super weirdo moved in right opposite our house,

451
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,951
and that person is...

452
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:53,951
What's the matter?

453
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,751
He never learns...

454
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,451
"Next Episode" -Bummers, rain...

455
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:04,251
We were supposed to play dodge ball during fifth period.

456
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,351
And I was looking forward to playing!

457
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:08,651
"I will be taking care of Ms. Kobayashi."

458
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:10,051
"Can you figure out where she is? From the fiend with 200 faces."

459
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:15,251
It seems that the hint is not limited to just the five numbers.

460
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:16,551
I guess so.

461
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:27,051
Next Conan, "1st Grade Class B Grand Project!"

462
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,451
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:46,951
"The face of dice"

464
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,451
Do dice have a face?

465
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:49,951
-Yes, six of them too! -No joke?

466
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,951
Are you all right?
