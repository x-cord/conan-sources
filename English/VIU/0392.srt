1
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,774
Today's case involves Officer Takagi.

2
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,374
An unimaginable alibi trick.

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,974
Will the police be able to outwit the killer?

4
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:27,474
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,174
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,975
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:57,762
I've to a lot of things to buy today, so be prepared, okay?

8
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:59,163
Yes.

9
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,563
She sure is in a good mood.

10
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,562
It sure feels good today!

11
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:07,463
Yes. True.

12
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,963
-Conan? -I'll be right back!

13
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,362
I'm sorry to bother you many times.

14
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,362
I'd like to confirm the time and situation of

15
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:25,362
when the body was found again.

16
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:27,862
The time was yesterday at 8 am.

17
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:30,962
The president didn't show up for the morning assembly before work

18
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,562
so you went to call him.

19
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:33,862
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:34,863
This way, please.

21
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,162
The president's room is in another building?

22
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:38,662
Yes, it's beyond the office.

23
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:43,062
You found President Katsugoro Kitamura lying there on the floor.

24
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,363
Yes, sir. That's right.

25
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,662
President.

26
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:51,963
Excuse me.

27
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,263
President, is there going to be no morning assembly today?

28
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,663
President!

29
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:04,063
President?

30
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,263
President!

31
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:16,763
"Mysterious 20 cm Height Discrepancy."

32
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,362
Did you notice anything at that time?

33
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,462
Not that I can remember.

34
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,462
The culprit was already arrested, right?

35
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,762
Why are you investigating things again?

36
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:27,062
You don't have concrete evidence?

37
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,463
Yeah. Rather we found out something totally absurd.

38
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,362
Hey, what's that absurd thing that you found out about?

39
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,262
Conan?

40
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,362
Conan!

41
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:37,762
Conan, you can't just run off like that.

42
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:39,162
Ran?

43
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:40,662
I'm so sorry!

44
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,962
And what's that absurd thing that you were talking about?

45
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:44,863
Yes. Well...

46
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:48,862
The victim is Mr. Katsugoro Kitamura, age 47.

47
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,463
He is the president of this factory.

48
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,362
The estimated time of death is

49
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:56,163
between 4 pm to 10 pm.

50
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:00,462
Soon after the body was found,

51
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,962
a cordon was set up.

52
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:02,963
The following day, which is yesterday,

53
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,463
the suspect was taken custody at the police.

54
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:07,463
However...

55
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,662
The suspect is Yuichi Minamida, age 47.

56
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:17,062
He is an owner chef of a small western food restaurant

57
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,462
and...

58
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:21,062
I was a classmate of the victim in high school.

59
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,762
"Yuichi Minamida (47)" -It's true that I went

60
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,962
to Kitamura's place yesterday.

61
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,962
But, I didn't do it.

62
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:30,862
You had a debt of three million yen that you owed Mr. Kitamura.

63
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,562
He refused to extend the deadline for your repayment,

64
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,962
so you were cornered and stabbed him.

65
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:37,962
-That's the story, isn't it? -Do you have evidence?

66
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:41,062
Are my prints on the knife that is the murder weapon?

67
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,362
They didn't detected any fingerprints

68
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,762
but the knife was discovered in his home.

69
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,862
In other words, the fingerprints were wiped off completely

70
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,663
after the murder was committed.

71
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,363
Inspector.

72
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:04,262
Beside owing Mr. Kitamura money,

73
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,163
you have another strong motive to kill him, don't you?

74
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:14,562
Mr. Kitamura was after your shop and your land.

75
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:18,462
He spread rumors about the sanitation standards at your shop,

76
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,462
which sent you into a financial rut.

77
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:23,563
Three months ago, he lent you three million yen.

78
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,563
"Katsugoro Kitamura (47), Factory President."

79
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,362
Minamida, after finding out what Mr. Kitamura was actually after,

80
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:37,362
was enraged and told the people around him how vexed he was.

81
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:38,862
On the day of payment,

82
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:40,662
which is also the day the murder was committed, at 1 pm,

83
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:44,662
Minamida appeared at this office to see Mr. Kitamura.

84
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:47,462
It's already 3 pm, just how long do you intend to stay here?

85
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,262
Please! Just another three days...

86
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,762
No, two days will do.

87
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,462
I lent you the cash because of the good old times.

88
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:56,562
If you don't have the cash, give me the deed to the land.

89
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,063
Kitamura!

90
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,362
What the...

91
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,562
Excuse me, president!

92
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,263
We're having some problems with the machine.

93
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:10,462
Okay! Go on ahead!

94
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,763
Yes, sir. Thank you.

95
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,563
Geez! I guess I have no choice.

96
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:18,663
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:20,662
I know just what you're after!

98
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:21,962
Let go of me!

99
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:23,862
You schemed it from the very start!

100
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:26,363
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

101
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:29,662
So what?

102
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:32,462
Leave your deed here and get lost.

103
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,763
You darn loser!

104
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,463
I think those words made Minamida make up his mind.

105
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:43,563
He waited for Mr. Kitamura to return.

106
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,962
But Minamida...

107
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,962
Yes, he did come back after about 30 minutes.

108
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,162
I started to negotiate with him once again,

109
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,662
and stayed there until around 6 pm in the evening,

110
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,562
but was eventually kicked out of the room.

111
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:08,262
What? A person who can testify to that?

112
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,262
I don't know.

113
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,262
I see! You've got all the circumstantial evidence,

114
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,663
but no concrete evidence.

115
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:19,663
I'm sure this is what Pops would say.

116
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:25,262
You haven't told me about the absurd thing yet!

117
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:27,062
The absurd thing is

118
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,662
the height difference between the suspect and Minamida.

119
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:30,962
Height difference?

120
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:32,263
What do you mean by that?

121
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,262
He's pretty tough to handle.

122
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:37,263
Besides...

123
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:41,362
The strange confidence I sense from him bothers me too.

124
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,262
Inspector!

125
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,763
I got an absurd report from the forensic officer.

126
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:51,062
The height of the victim Kitamura is 166 cm

127
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,362
and Minamida is 186 cm.

128
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,863
Minamida is 20 cm taller.

129
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,562
If so, then what?

130
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,362
In the case that a tall person stabs a person shorter than he is,

131
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:06,062
the angle of the knife would usually be from diagonally above.

132
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:09,262
On the other hand, if a short person stabs someone taller than himself,

133
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,262
it would be from diagonally below.

134
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,962
The knife that was stabbed into Kitamura's chest was

135
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,862
from diagonally below. In other words...

136
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,362
It's impossible for Minamida who is 20 cm taller

137
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,562
to have committed the crime.

138
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,562
No way.

139
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,962
So, I had the forensic officers use the angle of the knife

140
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,062
to calculate backwards

141
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,962
and come up with the height of the killer.

142
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,762
-And? -Yes, sir!

143
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,962
The results came out to be that the person is 110 cm.

144
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,062
-What? -What?

145
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:37,962
110 cm?

146
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:40,463
Isn't that the height of a child?

147
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,162
I get it!

148
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,162
If the killer stabbed from below where there are stairs,

149
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:47,862
even with Mr. Minamida's height,

150
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,462
he'd be able to stab from below.

151
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,262
The scene of the murder was a one-story building, with no stairs,

152
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,562
and there were no traces of the body being moved.

153
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:57,562
Then! He probably attacked the victim when he was off his guard?

154
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,362
Oh! Just what do you think you're doing?

155
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:02,062
He sank down low on the spur of the moment and stabbed?

156
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,763
Takagi. You just stabbed me, didn't you?

157
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,862
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:11,762
Inspector! I think that the killer is Minamida too.

159
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:14,762
But, the victim was stabbed from the front.

160
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,462
So, it's hard to believe that he was attacked when he was off his guard.

161
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,562
Moreover, a week before the incident,

162
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:22,362
Minamida sprained his ankle.

163
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,762
I wonder if he can make a surprise attack with his leg in a cast.

164
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,762
He would never be able to do something like that.

165
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,462
He may have been threatened with the knife

166
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:31,962
and forced to go up somewhere, and stabbed from below.

167
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,762
That's not possible.

168
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,662
The victim, Mr. Kitamura is a ranking judo belt owner,

169
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,062
so he wouldn't be intimidated by Minamida sticking a knife at him.

170
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,762
Everyone around him says Mr. Kitamura was probably strong

171
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,762
enough to attack Minamida instead.

172
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,062
True, no matter how you look at it.

173
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:49,362
Does that mean the difference in height is what's protecting Minamida?

174
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:52,062
What? You've got another picture!

175
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,063
No, Conan!

176
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,262
What? This man's wearing glasses?

177
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:01,962
He's not wearing them in the other picture.

178
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:04,762
Oh, these are reading glasses.

179
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:07,962
Reading glasses are something you wear when reading something, right?

180
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:11,062
Does that mean that Mr. Kitamura was attacked

181
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:13,462
when he was reading something?

182
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:16,362
But there's nothing like that in this room.

183
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:20,462
Right, the thing that Mr. Kitamura was supposedly reading back then

184
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,062
is nowhere in sight.

185
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,062
The problem is that something is gone

186
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:26,562
and Minamida took it with him.

187
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh! You're right on, Officer Takagi!

188
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,862
What on earth could it be?

189
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,162
We still don't know why he took it with him.

190
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:36,762
Hey, are these slippers the president's?

191
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,362
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:41,562
What about when Mr. Minamida came the day before yesterday?

193
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,462
Of course he was wearing them.

194
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,762
Mr. Minamida was barefoot though.

195
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:49,962
But, why are the slippers over here like this?

196
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,262
They probably came off from the impact when he was stabbed!

197
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,362
Impact?

198
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,462
But isn't it strange that they came off from the impact

199
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:00,062
when he was stabbed?

200
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,063
What?

201
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:03,462
Because they're nicely in place

202
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,762
just as if someone had put them in place, right?

203
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,762
I haven't touched them!

204
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:11,463
The slippers have been this way since the body was found.

205
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,862
They came off.

206
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:18,862
If not so, Mr. Minamida took them off after he killed the victim?

207
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:21,262
Why would he go out of his way to do something like that?

208
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,762
You think so, don't you?

209
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:26,162
Or maybe Mr. Kitamura took them off himself?

210
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,662
That's it!

211
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,962
But, why would he do something like that?

212
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:32,662
I can't figure it out!

213
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,462
Stabbed from the front diagonally below.

214
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:36,663
Height difference.

215
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,562
A ladder?

216
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:45,663
What?

217
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:49,163
What did he do?

218
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:53,262
President Kitamura.

219
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,062
What did he do?

220
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,263
With the ladder?

221
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,062
This is it!

222
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:05,862
But wait, why did Minamida think up something like this?

223
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,762
Why would an ordinary chef think up the trick of disguising his height

224
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:11,162
by doing something like this?

225
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,263
Why?

226
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,390
What were you waiting for?

227
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,889
At first, we thought it was a crime committed on the spur of the moment.

228
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,589
But after watching you, we've come to understand

229
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,589
that it was a carefully thought out murder.

230
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,689
If so, there's got to be a reason why you stayed in the president's room

231
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,189
from 1 pm to 6 pm.

232
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,589
You had another purpose other than asking him

233
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,789
to extend the time of repayment of the debt.

234
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,489
Five hours in the president's office.

235
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,990
Just what were you waiting for?

236
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,689
A miracle.

237
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,890
I guess.

238
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,189
Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,989
I've found out something absurd!

240
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,989
But, this is only a deduction.

241
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,889
I need evidence that will lead him to confess. Evidence.

242
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,990
What?

243
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,089
Something absurd?

244
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,389
Another absurd thing.

245
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,789
I hope it's not bad news.

246
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,789
Ten years ago, there was a series of random killings

247
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,989
within the Minato Police Station.

248
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,789
The person who was arrested back then

249
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,990
was Yuichi Minamida who was a company employee!

250
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,889
Although Minamida denied this,

251
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,489
the prosecutor had confidence and indicted him.

252
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,689
But the evidence that his lawyers submitted saved Minamida.

253
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,189
That proof was the angle of the stab wound

254
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,189
that the random killer left behind.

255
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,789
It was proven that with his height,

256
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,889
Minamida wouldn't have been able to stab anyone at that angle.

257
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,389
Moreover, during his hearing a new killer was arrested.

258
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,890
And the case was solved.

259
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,689
Which means that Minamida knew from the start

260
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,289
that the height difference between him

261
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,289
and the victim would serve as evidence in court?

262
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,789
I see! That's why he thought up this trick.

263
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,089
Right. In this case,

264
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,889
a trick involving height difference was used!

265
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,890
A trick using height difference is involved.

266
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,289
And what kind of trick is that, Officer Sato?

267
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,489
I haven't figured it out yet.

268
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,789
I'll go report this to Inspector Megure.

269
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,090
Officer Takagi, go back to headquarters right away too!

270
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,489
I'm going back to headquarters then.

271
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,289
Thank you so very much!

272
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,290
No problem.

273
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,989
Hey, you said Mr. Kitamura's height is 166 cm.

274
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,689
It that really tall for an adult or too short?

275
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,289
I want to become an adult quickly too,

276
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,789
because it's inconvenient being a child.

277
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,590
When things are in high places, I've got to use a ladder.

278
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,789
Adults are lucky at that point

279
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,189
because they don't have to use a ladder.

280
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,589
A ladder.

281
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,889
That's not really true.

282
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,889
When cleaning the air conditioner and changing light bulbs,

283
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,389
even Dad uses a ladder.

284
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,689
Light bulbs?

285
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,589
If the light bulbs were out at that time...

286
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,689
No way.

287
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,590
You mean the lights so conveniently went out back then?

288
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,089
Conan!

289
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,189
My mother used to always say, "Turn on the lights when it gets dark."

290
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,389
Conan!

291
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,089
She used to say that we'll ruin our eyes if we read in dark places.

292
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,890
In dark places. A book?

293
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,289
Reading glasses and...

294
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,490
light bulbs.

295
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,390
Slippers!

296
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,489
I see!

297
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,790
You guys get going home too! Okay?

298
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,790
All that I need now is proof to make him confess what he did.

299
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,190
Officer Takagi! He seems to have hit upon an idea!

300
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,189
Mr. Yuichi Minamida.

301
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,189
The thing that you waited for five hours

302
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,489
in Mr. Kitamura's president's room

303
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,589
was sundown, right?

304
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,190
Sundown?

305
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,990
Why would I have to wait for sundown?

306
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,489
Because that's when Mr. Kitamura turns on the lights of the office.

307
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,989
But the chandelier did not turn on that day.

308
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,089
Mr. Kitamura, who wanted to check out what was wrong, climbed a ladder.

309
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,889
You took this opportunity

310
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,389
to stab Mr. Kitamura who is 20 cm shorter than you from below.

311
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,189
Ridiculous.

312
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,789
Are you saying that the bulbs just happened to go out on that day?

313
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,190
Are you saying that I knew the bulbs were going to go out?

314
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,689
The bulbs didn't go out.

315
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,890
You loosened them!

316
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,490
What do you think you're doing?

317
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,489
I know just what you're after!

318
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,490
Let go of me!

319
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:59,489
You schemed it from the very start!

320
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,190
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

321
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,889
Eating, going to the restroom,

322
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,890
if you stick it out for five hours,

323
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:16,689
you had all the opportunity in the world to wait for Mr. Kitamura

324
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,189
to leave the office.

325
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,289
You probably loosened the bulbs

326
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,289
when he left to go check on machine trouble.

327
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,689
Mr. Kitamura left the room for 30 minutes.

328
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,889
How can you be sure that.

329
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,689
Kitamura would check the bulbs of the chandelier himself?

330
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,989
He's so haughty, it's more likely that he'd call one of his employees.

331
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,389
In order for him not to do so,

332
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,889
you handed over some important documents

333
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,989
after it started getting dark.

334
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,189
His reading glasses told us so.

335
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,390
What? Reading glasses?

336
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,689
The dead body was wearing reading glasses.

337
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,089
He was reading something,

338
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,089
no rather, it's evidence that he was trying to read something.

339
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,289
That something was also very important to the killer.

340
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,089
It was the deed for the land,

341
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,790
where your shop is that Mr. Kitamura wanted, wasn't it?

342
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,090
So, you've finally decided to give this to me.

343
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,789
It's not a black out.

344
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,889
Darn it! Not again.

345
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,790
Why at a time like this?

346
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,689
You set it up so that he checked the light himself

347
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,190
because he would find calling one of his employee is a waste of time.

348
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,189
What's this?

349
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,090
They're just loose.

350
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,690
You admit to your crime, don't you?

351
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,389
His reading glasses and slippers will probably serve as evidence

352
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,189
that Mr. Kitamura climbed the ladder.

353
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,290
But that's not proof that I loosened the bulbs.

354
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,589
Takagi.

355
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,390
Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,890
Hey, hey.

357
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,090
Oh, yes!

358
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,489
It's me, Mouri.

359
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,089
Mr. Mouri!

360
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,089
I heard about the case from Ran.

361
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,089
Did Minamida confess?

362
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,589
A little bit more.

363
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,989
He demanded that I show him proof that he rigged the chandelier.

364
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,789
Not having proof is the proof.

365
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,689
What? Just what do you mean?

366
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,490
Yes...

367
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,389
I see! I understand, I'll do so right away!

368
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,690
Inspector! I'm going to check with the forensic officers!

369
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,389
Hey, Takagi! Takagi!

370
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,289
What on earth is on his mind, anyway?

371
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,389
Okay! This is it for now!

372
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,390
-For now? -Yes.

373
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,189
Mr. Minamida, all culprits make mistakes.

374
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,589
There was one more thing besides the glasses and the slippers.

375
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,989
After committing the murder,

376
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,989
you wiped off your fingerprints from the knife, the murder weapon.

377
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,689
At the same time, you naturally wiped off your fingerprints

378
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,390
from the bulbs that you loosened.

379
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,589
Yes, the fact that it's not there may sometimes serves as proof.

380
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,089
I checked again with the forensic officer

381
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,289
whether any fingerprints were found on the chandelier.

382
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,689
No fingerprints were found whatsoever.

383
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,690
Mr. Kitamura's fingerprints that were supposed to be there weren't either.

384
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,289
I confirmed with his bereaved family too.

385
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,989
The bulbs of the chandelier also went out a month ago,

386
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,189
and it seems Mr. Kitamura himself changed the bulbs.

387
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,689
And yet, no one's fingerprints were found.

388
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,689
This is proof that someone obviously rigged the bulbs.

389
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,689
The trick that you used of making Mr. Kitamura climb the ladder

390
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,589
and stabbing him from below

391
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,089
is the same trick of height difference and angle of the stab wound

392
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,489
that served as proof to your innocence 10 years ago, Mr. Minamida.

393
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,890
On the contrary, this time lead to accusing you as the killer.

394
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,189
Ten years ago, I was innocent.

395
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,889
But my company fired me as soon as I was arrested.

396
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,489
My father was the only one who believed me.

397
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,789
The shop was the dream of my father who died a year ago.

398
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,590
It's his dream that I had to take over and protect.

399
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,389
Kitamura tried to take that away from me!

400
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,489
He's the real criminal!

401
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,089
But, no matter what reasons you may have,

402
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,789
what value is there to a dream that you must protect

403
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,590
at the expense of someone's life?

404
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,089
-At Sanchome! -At Sanchome!

405
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,090
There's a black demon!

406
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,690
What did he just say?

407
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,089
-I don't know! -Yes!

408
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,090
This is the Mouri Detective Agency.

409
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,089
Officer Takagi, what's up?

410
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,689
Yes! Thanks to you, he confessed!

411
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,989
What? Confessed?

412
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,789
-We're back! -What?

413
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,489
Minamida? What?

414
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,589
Thank you so very much!

415
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,790
Goodbye.

416
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,789
What is he talking about?

417
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,590
Hey, what's the matter, Pops?

418
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,589
He said Minamida confessed and thank you.

419
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,989
All right.

420
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,590
Don't tell me something happened again without my knowing?

421
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,489
It's pretty interesting being a detective!

422
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,190
I agree with you, Pops!

423
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,789
"Next Episode."

424
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,090
Police.

425
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,389
A kidnapping case.

426
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,189
The time limit is 5 pm.

427
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,489
There's only an hour and a half to go!

428
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,989
Maybe the real purpose behind this kidnapping is...

429
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,789
What the...

430
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,789
There's another mastermind.

431
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,590
If so, something is odd.

432
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,490
Next Conan, "A Mock Kidnap... Case".

433

Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,789
"Oil"

435
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,189
I received cookies today.

436
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,389
-What? From who? -You want some?

437
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,390
-That's not what I mean. -I'm not giving you any.
