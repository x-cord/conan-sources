"Caution! Many Accidents at Intersection."

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,570
Oh, a rainbow!

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,670
See, it's beautiful!

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,570
A rainbow...

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,270
Boy, staying up all night playing mahjong.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,370
Wrong. It was a match of a life time.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,470
Because Yoko Okino's picture was at stake.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,370
I doubt if it's something that you should do

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,870
after coming all the way to a hot spring.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,870
Look at that!

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,270
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,670
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,470
The view if clear and yet many accidents occur.

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,670
There's something suspicious about the devilish intersection.

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,270
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,670
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

18
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:48,998
"Intersection of fear."

19
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,081
It's an accident!

20
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,481
Ran, you go over to the car on that side!

21
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:07,481
Okay!

22
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,381
This is...

23
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:16,381
No good! I can't rescue him!

24
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,081
Ran, how is it on your side?

25
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,581
I can't open the door!

26
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,981
Please get a hold of yourself!

27
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,681
Hey, both these cars were parked

28
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,781
at the convenience store a while ago, right?

29
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,281
Never mind about that!

30
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,781
Are you all right?

31
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,881
Yeah, I guess so.

32
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,481
What happened?

33
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:44,881
You seem to have gotten into a traffic accident.

34
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:48,281
I'm sure there was another car involved.

35
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,081
I tried to help him,

36
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,881
but the car was on fire and I couldn't get close.

37
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,681
Are you all right?

38
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,381
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

39
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,381
Yes!

40
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,681
Why did this happen?

41
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:19,281
It's such a big accident.

42
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,981
What shall I do?

43
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:25,381
I've done something terrible!

44
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:27,781
Come... please calm down.

45
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,381
Would you like a cigarette?

46
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,181
Oh, but I don't smoke.

47
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,081
Oh, I see.

48
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,681
You're the one who was driving the green car?

49
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:39,981
Yes.

50
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:43,481
Would it be okay if I asked you some questions?

51
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,081
-Yes. -First of all, could you tell me your name and occupation?

52
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:50,981
"Seiji Kurumatani, age 28" -Seiji Kurumatani. I'm an auto mechanic.

53
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,381
You're the first person who found him?

54
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,381
Your name please?

55
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:02,081
Oh, you're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

56
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,681
I've heard about you.

57
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,581
Oh well, it's no big deal.

58
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,281
You mean, that Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:11,381
"Michida Junko, age 38" -I'm so honored.

60
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,781
"Michida Junko, age 38" -to get help from a famed detective.

61
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,081
And, you're the first one who found the cars

62
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,681
who got into an accident, Mr. Mouri?

63
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:19,981
Yes, the red one was already on flames.

64
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:24,681
Mr. Hayato Hayamizu who was driving the car was found dead.

65
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,381
Mr. Kurumatani...

66
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,481
will you tell me about the time the accident occurred?

67
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,281
Yes.

68
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,181
When I was ready to enter the intersection,

69
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:37,181
I, for some reason, didn't realize the other car coming at all.

70
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,181
I just kept going straight,

71
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,581
then, the red car suddenly appeared in front of me.

72
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:48,081
I slammed on the brakes and turned the wheels,

73
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,181
but I couldn't avoid the car.

74
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,681
Didn't you stop once

75
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,281
before entering the intersection?

76
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,781
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,181
I wasn't careful enough.

78
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:00,281
That's why accidents occur.

79
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,581
The steel column is so bent out of shape.

80
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:09,481
The front of this car is reinforced with a grill guard.

81
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:17,281
But, the thing about the other car

82
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,381
suddenly appearing in front of him bothers me.

83
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:22,181
I'll bet you were dozing off while driving,

84
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,181
or didn't have your eyes on the road.

85
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:25,581
Neither!

86
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,881
I was looking ahead while driving like I should,

87
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,881
but I didn't see the other car at all!

88
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,581
No way!

89
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:35,081
It's an intersection located right in the middle of a rice field

90
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:36,481
and has a clear view, you know.

91
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,881
It could be that...

92
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:41,881
That?

93
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:45,581
This place is known for frequent accidents occurring.

94
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:49,581
The locals call it the intersection of fear.

95
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,881
The intersection of fear?

96
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,181
According to a story I heard,

97
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,281
it's said that the cause of the accidents

98
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,481
is due to the collision course phenomenon.

99
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:02,081
What's that thing called the collision course?

100
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:04,681
The collision course phenomenon.

101
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,581
It's an intersection with a clear view,

102
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:09,081
and in broad daylight, but still accidents occur.

103
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:14,781
When two cars head into the intersection at the same speed,

104
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,781
both cars will be positioned at an angle of 45 degrees

105
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,681
at all times from the front.

106
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:23,081
In other words, the other car always look to be in the same position,

107
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,781
outside your visual range.

108
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,381
The vision of humans

109
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,981
are broadly divided into central and peripheral vision,

110
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,281
but since it is difficult

111
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,481
to confirm small things using peripheral vision,

112
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,881
mutually noticing the other car may be delayed,

113
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:42,481
and both cars may enter the intersection without noticing the other,

114
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,681
thus, crash into each other.

115
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,081
Then, you're saying that Mr. Kurumatani's accident

116
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,281
was also because of that korean course phenomenon?

117
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,781
It's collision course.

118
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,881
That could've been the reason the accident occurred.

119
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,781
I had no idea there was such a phenomenon.

120
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,881
I should've... I should've been more careful driving.

121
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:08,281
But...

122
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,981
There aren't any traces

123
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,081
whatsoever of braking with the red car.

124
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,781
The driver in the red car

125
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,481
didn't notice the other car coming at all too, then.

126
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:23,481
Which makes the collision course phenomenon

127
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,081
even more plausible.

128
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,881
But, I just can't believe yet that both car

129
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,981
wouldn't notice each other

130
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,581
in a spacious place like this.

131
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,881
I guess you're suspicious of everything

132
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,981
because you're a detective.

133
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,681
The two cars that we saw

134
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,381
at the convenience store are all smashed up.

135
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,281
Right, Pops?

136
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,781
Yeah... right.

137
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:50,081
What? Both cars were at the convenience store?

138
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:54,081
Yes, when we stopped over to buy canned coffee,

139
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:58,381
we saw both cars leave the parking lot almost simultaneously.

140
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,481
Hold it.

141
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,081
Come to think of it, it's too coincidental, isn't it?

142
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,681
What is it?

143
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,981
The two cars that left the convenience store at almost the same time,

144
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,381
take separate roads

145
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:15,981
and a few minutes later, they collide here.

146
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:18,481
I wonder if it's really a coincidence?

147
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:22,481
I think it's just a casual coincidence.

148
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:23,981
If you like, would you like to go

149
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,781
and confirm at the convenience store?

150
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:33,381
Yes, he came at around 14:00.

151
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,781
He was acting strange,

152
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,181
so something bothered me.

153
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,181
Did you come yesterday, too, sir?

154
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,881
See, I remember that green car.

155
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,781
That's Kurumatani's car!

156
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,981
Don't mix things up!

157
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,081
He yelled at me.

158
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,381
No way.

159
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,781
He really said Kurumatani?

160
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,781
-Yes, sir. -Mr. Hayamizu knew Mr. Kurumatani.

161
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,481
Something smells.

162
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,081
Then...

163
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,781
How about this man?

164
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:10,681
He...

165
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,381
He was arguing with the young man

166
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:15,581
I was talking about a while ago.

167
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,981
I see.

168
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,781
I must've seen the two cars leave,

169
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:22,481
after they both got into an argument.

170
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,581
Soon after that, the accident occurred.

171
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,281
If I remember correctly, back then...

172
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,581
Here goes, Conan.

173
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,781
Okay.

174
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,981
Mr. Kurumatani.

175
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,381
You knew Mr. Hayamizu

176
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,181
who was riding the red car, didn't you?

177
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,781
Oh, well...

178
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,681
I've seen him around,

179
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,081
but I wasn't all that sure.

180
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,381
Then, what were arguing over

181
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,481
at the convenience store with Mr. Hayamizu?

182
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,781
The manager of the convenience store

183
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:23,081
saw you both arguing.

184
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,381
The fact is, that red foreign car is a second hand car

185
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,281
that my friend sold him three months ago.

186
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,881
When I asked him about the loan of the car

187
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,381
not being paid by the buyer,

188
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:37,281
he suddenly broke out in rage.

189
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,981
I see.

190
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:43,781
By the way, why did you come driving over this way?

191
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,981
You live in the opposite direction, don't you?

192
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:48,281
No special reason.

193
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:52,781
I was driving around because I had time to kill.

194
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:55,181
The rainbow was nice too.

195
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,781
Rainbow? I wonder if there was any rainbow.

196
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,381
What is it anyway, since a while ago?

197
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:03,481
Why are you talking about things

198
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,181
that have nothing to do with the accident?

199
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,881
I get it!

200
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:10,581
Mr. Kurumatani, you're an auto mechanic, aren't you?

201
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,381
Yes, I am.

202
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,681
You knew that this was a place

203
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,481
full of collisions beforehand.

204
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,281
No, I didn't.

205
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,281
Since you got into an argument with Mr. Hayazumi,

206
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:25,081
you rigged the brakes of his car

207
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,781
during the few minutes he was shopping in the convenience store.

208
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,981
You could probably do so hands down,

209
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,781
being that you're an auto mechanic.

210
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,581
That's why there were no traces of brakes

211
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:34,681
where the red foreign car was.

212
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:37,381
But, nothing abnormal was found

213
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,481
in the brakes of the red car.

214
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,781
Is that so?

215
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:45,681
But, I'll bet you stuck something in between the brake pedal.

216
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,981
It's an old trick that's used when you want to fake an accident.

217
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:54,481
You were planning to give Mr. Hayamizu a taste of his own medicine,

218
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,781
but it turned out into an accident you never imagined would happen,

219
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,881
and Mr. Hayamizu died.

220
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,181
That's why you wanted to hide the fact, isn't that right?

221
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,681
But nothing suspicious was found

222
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,181
inside the red car.

223
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,481
Mr. Detective!

224
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:12,181
Please cut out saying strange things!

225
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:19,081
Dad, don't smoke while you're walking!

226
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,381
There's an ashtray in the car too, isn't there?

227
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,681
Yeah.

228
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,181
Ashtray in the car?

229
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,781
I see.

230
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,281
So, that's the story.

231
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,216
What're you doing, Conan?

232
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,416
Nothing much.

233
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,816
The image on the surveillance camera for traffic is ready.

234
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,316
A surveillance camera here?

235
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,216
Because there are too many accidents.

236
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,816
I see.

237
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,516
Not for kids!

238
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,616
After the red foreign car entered the intersection

239
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,816
without braking at all,

240
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,416
the green car that came later crashed into it.

241
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:22,316
The green car crashed into the sign after that and stopped.

242
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:25,116
The red car fell into the irrigation channel.

243
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:30,316
There seems to be nothing suspicious about.

244
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:33,616
It seems to be so.

245
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:35,916
I guess there's no problem closing this case as an accident.

246
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,716
Darn.

247
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,416
I'd like to see the image on the surveillance camera.

248
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,016
Come on. Dad'll scold you if go here and there.

249
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:51,916
Huh?

250
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,716
Ran, excuse me a bit.

251
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,816
Conan.

252
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:57,916
Boy.

253
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,416
This is...

254
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,216
Ran.

255
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,916
You mean, Dad?

256
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,316
How was it?

257
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,216
Just as you said,

258
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:29,716
we think that it is an accident of two cars colliding.

259
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:32,716
Only, your ignoring to stop at the stop sign

260
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,216
is a grave offense.

261
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,316
I am very sorry.

262
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,616
So, the case is closed!

263
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,616
I'm counting on you, Ran.

264
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,116
I'm taking you back to the station

265
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:50,316
and interrogating you regarding the accident,

266
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,716
so please come with me.

267
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,116
All right.

268
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:57,716
Please wait.

269
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:02,516
This is not just a mere traffic accident,

270
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:05,516
but rather a planned homicide case.

271
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,116
What?

272
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,116
Just what do you mean?

273
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:11,416
It's not true that Mr. Kurumatani coincidentally happened

274
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,916
to run into Mr. Hayamizu at the convenience store.

275
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,716
Just... just what do you think you're saying?

276
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,816
Just a while ago,

277
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:22,716
the boy I came with saw the ashtray in your car,

278
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,516
and told me that it was full of cigarette butts.

279
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,616
That's strange,

280
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:31,916
because you don't seem to smoke.

281
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,316
Well, that's...

282
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:36,416
The brand name of that cigarette is called Paradise

283
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,916
and moreover, the filter of all the cigarette butts were bitten flat.

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:45,316
I mean it's the same as the cigarette butts that were thrown away

285
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,416
by Mr. Hayamizu in front of the convenience store.

286
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,016
In other words, Mr. Hayamizu drove the green car

287
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:54,716
up to that convenience store.

288
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,316
It's most likely that

289
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,616
you lent the green car to Mr. Hayamizu

290
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:03,316
while he was having his car tuned up at the factory.

291
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:06,916
And isn't it that you promised to meet Mr. Hayamizu

292
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,316
at the convenience store after tune-up was done

293
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:11,916
to exchange his car for the green car that you lent him?

294
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,516
Then you pretended to have a collision with Mr. Hayamizu

295
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,516
and killed him, right?

296
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,216
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:22,416
In other words, Mr. Kurumatani was planning

298
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,416
to collide with Mr. Hayamizu's car to begin with.

299
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,416
Don't be ridiculous!

300
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,916
I'm hurt too, you know!

301
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,816
One mistake, and I may have been dead too.

302
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,916
No worry about that with your car,

303
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:41,416
because it's equipped with iron pipe grill guard.

304
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,216
Getting hurt would make it look even more like an accident

305
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,716
and is better for you, isn't it?

306
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,116
Making up stories!

307
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,316
It's an accident that was caused by the collision course!

308
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,416
The fact that there were no traces of the other driver

309
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,516
stepping on the brakes is proof, isn't it?

310
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,716
True.

311
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,416
Mr. Mouri, I think it would be difficult

312
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,316
to cause this phenomenon deliberately.

313
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,316
The fact that Mr. Hayamizu didn't step on the brakes

314
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:08,316
is not because of the collision course phenomenon.

315
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:11,516
Mr. Kurumatani rigged it,

316
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:15,816
so that Mr. Hayamizu couldn't step on the gas.

317
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,516
But, they just said that the car wasn't rigged in any way just now.

318
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:21,016
The car wasn't.

319
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,516
Another place was rigged.

320
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,916
-Ran! -Oh, yes!

321
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,116
It's the same as a road sign

322
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,616
and reflective plate is pasted on it.

323
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,916
It is normally positioned,

324
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,016
so that it faces the direction in which Mr. Hayamizu's car came from

325
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,116
and it stands out when light is shined on it.

326
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:51,316
The glare does strain the eyes.

327
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,216
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kurumatani

328
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,816
had changed the direction the sign faced beforehand.

329
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:00,216
If so, the light that reflects from the sign

330
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:02,716
will shine on Mr. Hayamizu's car.

331
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:06,716
I wonder why we didn't notice it

332
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,316
when we saw the image on the surveillance camera?

333
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:11,516
It was outside the visual range of the surveillance camera,

334
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,516
it wasn't in view.

335
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:17,216
After leaving the convenience store,

336
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,516
Mr. Hayamizu's car headed for this intersection

337
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,716
using the road alongside the irrigation channel.

338
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:25,116
At the intersection, he had the right of way,

339
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:29,216
so he drove straight without slowing down.

340
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:30,716
Just about that time,

341
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,116
the light that reflected on the sign,

342
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:34,116
was at an angle that shined a little

343
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:36,816
in the foreground of the intersection.

344
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:40,416
Not aware of this, Mr. Hayamizu approached the intersection.

345
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,216
What the...

346
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:00,216
Mr. Hayamizu was surprised at the blinding light

347
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,916
and failed to step on the brakes.

348
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,916
Moreover, because of the after image of the reflected light,

349
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,116
Mr. Kurumatani's car wasn't found.

350
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:12,016
He probably picked 14:00 as the time to meet at the convenience store,

351
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:15,216
taking into consideration the angle of the sun.

352
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,916
Could it be that he crashed into the sign

353
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,016
to cover up the fact that he changed directions?

354
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:23,016
It's most likely that you crashed into Mr. Hayamizu's car

355
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,916
on the driver's seat side.

356
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:30,016
I actually wanted to crash into that guy directly.

357
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:35,116
-Huh? -Hayamizu hit-and-run my little sister a year ago.

358
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,516
What?

359
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,816
Six months ago,

360
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:41,616
I realized when a red foreign car came in for a tune up.

361
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:46,516
Ever since then, all I thought about is avenging her death.

362
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,316
Hayamizu brought that car in again for a tune up.

363
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,916
That's why I planned what I did.

364
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,516
I urged him to turn himself into the police

365
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,016
when he came to return the car.

366
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,116
But, he insisted on playing dumb,

367
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,816
so I went on with my plan.

368
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,216
If he only turned himself in,

369
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:11,916
I would've at least spared him his life, that rat.

370
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,016
You're just as much a rat yourself

371
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:16,516
if you keep quiet about the fact

372
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,316
that you planned an accident to kill Mr. Hayamizu.

373
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:21,716
Now's your turn to turn yourself in.

374
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:31,616
Mr. Detective, when did you realize my scheme?

375
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:36,416
When you said you didn't notice the rainbow.

376
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,216
The collision course phenomenon cannot happen

377
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,016
unless the driver is looking ahead.

378
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,616
You didn't notice the rainbow,

379
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,616
because you were so absorbed in wanting to hit Mr. Hayamizu's car

380
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:50,216
that you were looking only to the side, isn't that right?

381
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:54,216
If you keep on harboring feelings of grudge and hate,

382
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,316
you'll lose sight of the beautiful things

383
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,316
right in front of your eyes.

384
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:26,316
Dad, it's dangerous to speed so much

385
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:27,716
when you didn't get enough sleep.

386
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:31,116
I'm fine. My head's cleared up.

387
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,316
I guess so, after all you did get some sleep.

388
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:35,816
We've got to return the rental car tonight

389
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:38,816
or we'll have to pay extension fee, don't we?

390
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:41,216
But, everything will be in vain if we get into an accident, you know.

391
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:42,516
I'm fine...

392
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:46,516
Besides, I've got a mahjong game tonight

393
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:48,916
and the prize is Yoko-chan's premium DVD!

394
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:52,116
I'll be there soon, Yoko-chan!

395
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:55,516
This is what you call, Kogoro phenomenon. He never learns.

396
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,516
"Next Episode" -The yawning girl with those unpleasing eyes.

397
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:03,616
I'm so sorry.

398
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,616
That I'm the yawning girl with unpleasing eyes.

399
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,516
The car that you hitchhiked on

400
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,716
was that of bad people?

401
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,616
I wonder who these two are?

402
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:18,816
What if they're men from the Black Organization?

403
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:22,016
They may virtually kill us. Kill us all together?

404
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,416
Next Conan,

405
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:30,416
"Dangerous Twosome."

406
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,746
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,446
"Dialect."

408
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:48,446
In the next episode Dr. Agasa and Ai are in big trouble.

409
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,146
-Kansai dialect? -Make sure you tune in next week too, okay?
