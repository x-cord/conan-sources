1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:04,040
Dragged along by Ran, Sonoko and Sera

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:07,240
so they could buy new swimsuits to go to the pool,

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:11,240
I arrived at the department store.

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,841
But, once I was there...

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,740
The victim is

6
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,340
"Ritsuko Sashihara (41)" -the president of a cosmetic company,

7
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,340
Ms. Ritsuko Sashihara.

8
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:34,440
The index finger and thumb of the left hand of the corpse was erect.

9
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,440
On the nail of her right hand,

10
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:41,040
her own red lipstick was painted on.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,640
But, why?

12
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,241
What on earth was it for?

13
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,540
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,940
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

15
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,940
The shape of the fingers and red lipstick.

16
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,140
The mysterious case and Sera's secret.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,241
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:49,914
"Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 2)"

21
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,050
What?

22
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,850
"Reia Nanbu (24)" -The order in which Ms. Sashihara, Ms. Yamaki

23
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,350
and Ms. Nitsuka entered the fitting room?

24
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,351
Yes.

25
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,250
I think...

26
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:05,150
it was Ms. Yamaki first.

27
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,050
She mentioned that she forgot the place where the fitting room was

28
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:11,850
so I took her over to the fitting room.

29
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,750
Did you see the white sandals in question back then?

30
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:18,351
I think it was already in front of the fitting room to the very right.

31
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,150
And, the next was Ms. Sashihara.

32
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,350
She went into the fitting in the middle that was vacant.

33
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,850
I see.

34
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,650
So Ms. Nitsuka went in last?

35
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,750
Yes.

36
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:36,450
She went in a while after Ms. Sashihara entered.

37
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,750
She was quite annoyed

38
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,350
because the fitting room wouldn't empty out for a while.

39
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,350
According to Conan,

40
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,850
it seems Ms. Sashihara said something upsetting to you?

41
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,351
Yes.

42
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,350
But, my superior told me,

43
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,850
"I was repeatedly told obnoxious remarks too."

44
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:54,051
So to not be bothered about it.

45
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,250
Hey, the president who died said that

46
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:02,750
she met the salesclerk for the first time today.

47
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:06,050
I don't recognize you. Are you new here?

48
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,150
But, isn't it a fact that you saw her a week ago?

49
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,250
Yes.

50
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,050
When Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room,

51
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,850
she came here together with Ms. Yamaki.

52
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,950
Are the black pumps you're wearing and those white sneakers

53
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,050
the only shoes you have?

54
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,150
Yes.

55
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:25,850
I leave my pumps in the locker here.

56
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,950
And when I commute to work I wear these sneakers.

57
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:31,550
Are you sure you only use those two pairs of shoes?

58
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:33,050
If you think I'm lying,

59
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:36,250
I don't mind if you search the entire store.

60
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,950
Then, Ms. Nanbu,

61
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:40,050
will you please draw a picture of the white sandals

62
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:42,050
that you said you saw over here?

63
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,850
A simple drawing would do, so please draw it.

64
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,850
Okay.

65
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:47,851
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Yes.

66
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,850
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Like the salesclerk said,

67
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:52,250
I think the white sandals were there

68
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:56,050
before I entered the fitting room.

69
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,750
After that, President Sashihara went inside the fitting room

70
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,950
next to the one you were in.

71
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:03,850
Did you hear any strange sounds or something?

72
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,650
No, nothing in particular.

73
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,350
Isn't it a fact that you went into the fitting room

74
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,450
saying something like "May I help you take off your clothes?"

75
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,650
Why should I do something like that!

76
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm not her servant!

77
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:18,750
But, she said she paid back your debts for you

78
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,750
and got you a job in her company and so forth, right?

79
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:27,650
Yes. It's true that I owed her a lot but...

80
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,850
You saw the president's clothes, didn't you?

81
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:33,750
They weren't clothes that she needed help in removing, were they?

82
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,150
You're right.

83
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,350
By the way,

84
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:38,750
the box that's inside your bag,

85
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,750
is it a gift for someone?

86
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,750
Yes. It's for the president of this shop.

87
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,550
It's a new item that our company has marketed

88
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,250
and I was told by President Sashihara to give it to a salesclerk here

89
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,450
to hand it over to the president.

90
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,150
If you want to, you can open it and confirm for yourself.

91
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,550
It's just perfume.

92
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,350
Yes, if it's all right with you, we'll do so later.

93
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,650
And please draw a picture of the white sandals

94
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,550
that we talked about before.

95
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,050
Just a simple drawing will do.

96
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,050
All right.

97
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,250
"Tomoyo Nitsuka (43)" -Yes, that's right!

98
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:12,850
A week ago, I fainted in the fitting room here!

99
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,550
Because of the dog hair that the person called Sashihara

100
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,350
scattered all over the place.

101
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:20,650
I see, you're allergic to dogs.

102
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,550
According to forensics,

103
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,950
there were quite a lot of dog hair on the floor of the crime scene.

104
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,150
I see.

105
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:32,050
And? Do you know when the owner of the white sandals in question

106
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,750
came out of the fitting room?

107
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,450
Between 2:43 pm to 2:44 pm.

108
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,950
Because I went to check every minute

109
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:44,151
to see if the fitting room to the very right was empty!

110
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,450
Why did it have to be the room on the very right?

111
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,950
Because the middle room was the room full of dog hair of that President.

112
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,750
Her worker was in the room to the left, right?

113
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,750
Her worker may also have dog hair on her too, right?

114
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,750
Which means you knew that the victim went into the fitting room

115
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,250
in the middle?

116
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,550
Yes. I guess.

117
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:07,050
What is that light brown case looking thing?

118
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,650
Oh, this?

119
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,650
This is a portable folding slipper!

120
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:15,051
Because I was scheduled to go to China after this.

121
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:21,250
Didn't you rig those slippers to make them look like white sandals?

122
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,350
What?

123
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,950
Take a good look! These are beige!

124
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:28,350
I saw white sandals that were of a totally different shape too!

125
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:29,351
Hey, you!

126
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:30,950
Lend me a paper and pen!

127
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,251
I'll draw you what it looked like!

128
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,350
All three drew similar pictures.

129
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:43,550
It seems that there actually was a customer who wore white sandals.

130
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,350
Inspector Megure.

131
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:49,150
Forensics say they found a scissors, remnants of cellophane tape,

132
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,450
a straw and its cut pieces in the trash can

133
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,750
near the fitting room.

134
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,251
Does it have anything to do with the case?

135
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,050
Hold on...

136
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,450
You still haven't figured out who the perp is?

137
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:05,350
No. The perp is probably...

138
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,250
That person!

139
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,950
No way! You've already figured it out?

140
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:10,951
Yeah.

141
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:15,650
But we don't know how the perp went into the fitting room

142
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:17,150
without her causing a commotion yet.

143
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,950
That's probably because the victim was wearing a face cover!

144
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,750
You know, the disposal masks to cover your face

145
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,450
to avoid makeup getting on the merchandise!

146
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,650
You can't see well when you're wearing those.

147
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:31,850
But, it's not that you can't see at all,

148
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,350
so if someone comes in, you can tell, you know?

149
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:39,050
Are they left in the fitting room?

150
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:43,650
Well, some shops hand them out before you enter the fitting room.

151
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:47,150
But there are quite a few shops that have them in the fitting room too.

152
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,351
They're inside what looks to be a big tissue box.

153
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,450
I see.

154
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,051
So, that's what happened.

155
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:59,050
This wasn't the first.

156
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,251
But the second attempt at murder!

157
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:08,627
Inspector Megure!

158
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:12,227
We checked the security cameras in the shop,

159
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:14,627
but many of the customers' feet weren't in view.

160
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:17,927
We weren't able to confirm whether anyone was wearing the white sandals

161
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:21,627
that the three women said they saw in front of the fitting room

162
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,227
to the very right at the time of the murder.

163
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,527
If so, the perp could be the one who was wearing the white sandals

164
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,627
and have already fled.

165
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:32,027
Or it could be the one who first found the body,

166
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:35,427
the salesclerk of this shop, Ms. Reia Nanbu.

167
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:40,427
Or the one who was using the fitting room on the very left

168
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,027
even before the victim who went into the fitting room in the middle,

169
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:46,827
Ms. Ayami Yamaki, who is also an employee of the victim.

170
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:51,027
Or after the customer who wore the white sandals left the fitting room,

171
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,027
the one who used that fitting room on the very right,

172
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:57,727
the woman allergic to dogs, Ms. Tomoyo Nitsuka.

173
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:03,327
The thing is how did the perp make it into the fitting room?

174
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:06,427
Yeah. If someone came into the fitting room,

175
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,427
the victim would've shouted loudly.

176
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:11,927
Yes. Even if the perp were to sneak up to her...

177
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:15,727
The perp's reflection should've been seen on this mirror.

178
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,927
But...

179
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,227
What if the victim was fainted

180
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:24,127
even before the perp entered the room.

181
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,727
She wouldn't be able to shout,

182
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,727
and the perp could've strangled her too, right?

183
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,227
The victim was passed out?

184
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,827
But, how?

185
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:36,427
The face cover on the right corner of the fitting room was used!

186
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,827
Men may not know much about them

187
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:40,727
but when women try clothes on,

188
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,628
they use them to keep makeup from soiling the clothes!

189
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:49,027
If chloroform or something was soaked into the face covers,

190
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:53,927
the victim would wear the face cover and pass herself out!

191
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,628
I see.

192
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,827
Well, I didn't know about face covers either,

193
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:03,727
so I was surprised thinking that it was a really large tissue box.

194
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:08,027
Which means that the perp has a bottle of chloroform.

195
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:11,527
You don't need a bottle. A straw would do fine!

196
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:12,827
A straw?

197
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:18,027
You melt one end of the straw using a hair iron,

198
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:21,127
then pour chloroform into the open end.

199
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,727
Then, melt the open end of the straw

200
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,827
with the hair iron again to close it!

201
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:29,927
All you have to do when using it is to cut one end with a scissors.

202
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,927
I read online that it's a convenient way

203
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:35,127
to store cosmetics and reduce luggage when traveling!

204
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,927
So, that's what the straw and scissors found in the trash can

205
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:40,427
near the crime scene were for.

206
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:42,428
I'll go check with forensics!

207
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:48,927
But, even if the face covers were soaked in chloroform,

208
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:53,927
the perp had to know which fitting room the victim would enter.

209
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:57,527
Wouldn't she enter if only the middle fitting room was open?

210
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:00,927
There's a possibility of other customers entering too, isn't there?

211
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:06,227
Yeah, the perp tried to commit this crime a week ago,

212
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:08,527
but back then as you said,

213
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,927
before the victim entered the room,

214
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:13,227
Ms. Nitsuka entered the room, so the plan failed.

215
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:16,427
In other words, this was the second time she committed the crime!

216
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:20,627
Are you saying that Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room a week ago,

217
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:22,327
not of dog allergy,

218
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:24,927
but because she sniffed chloroform.

219
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:28,727
But how did the perp leave the middle room open?

220
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:32,227
Although the perp were to enter one out of the three rooms,

221
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,927
how would the other room be blocked off?

222
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:39,927
The perp put the white sandals in front of the other fitting room.

223
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,027
Yes, the only person who could've done this

224
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,927
is the one who was in the fitting room to the left

225
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,628
before the victim entered the fitting room in the middle.

226
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:50,627
Ms. Ayami Yamaki!

227
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:52,228
It was you!

228
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,827
Hey, hold it!

229
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:01,127
I didn't have any white sandals on me, did I?

230
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,427
Besides, the white sandals were there

231
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,627
before I went into the fitting room!

232
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,227
Isn't that right, salesclerk?

233
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:09,027
Yes.

234
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:11,027
Conan!

235
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:12,427
I bought it!

236
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:15,627
Insoles, cellophane tape and a white ribbon!

237
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,927
Thank you!

238
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:20,227
But what would anyone use something like this for?

239
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:24,527
We're going to make the other customer!

240
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,227
The other...

241
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:27,628
Customer?

242
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,427
First of all,

243
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,827
place the white ribbon

244
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,027
against the heel of the insole.

245
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:41,127
Then cross both edges of the ribbon under the insole

246
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,127
and tape it in place.

247
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:47,627
Then cross the ribbons loosely over the top.

248
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,427
After that, wrap both ends again around the back and tape in place.

249
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:54,827
There! The white sandal is completed!

250
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:58,227
-Amazing. -You're pretty good, kid.

251
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,727
I'm good at arts and crafts.

252
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:04,627
And you make two of these...

253
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,627
Then, you place it in front of the fitting room.

254
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,627
To make it look as if a customer is inside, see?

255
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:15,027
But wouldn't it be obvious because they have no heels and are flat?

256
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:21,027
But if you raise the heels by placing a cell phone under them...

257
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,027
See? They look like sandals from above!

258
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,727
Fantastic!

259
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:28,027
You had one, didn't you?

260
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:31,128
A gift that was wrapped with a white ribbon.

261
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:36,927
If you made the white sandals beforehand and kept them in your bag,

262
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,827
all that would be left after the murder

263
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:42,727
would be the tape you used to make the sandals.

264
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:45,127
You could wrap the ribbons around the gift

265
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:49,227
and put the insole inside the shoe that you're wearing and hide it!

266
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,527
I see.

267
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:54,527
The bits of tape we found with the straw and scissors

268
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,627
were from the trash can that was made

269
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,127
when she removed the ribbon from the insole.

270
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:00,927
Since the tape is hard to peel off unless with your bare hands,

271
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:03,027
fingerprints should be left behind.

272
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,727
In other words, you committed the crime in this order.

273
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:10,827
First, after confirming that three of the fitting rooms were empty,

274
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,827
you placed the white sandals in front of the fitting room to the right

275
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:19,527
then told the salesclerk that you forgot where the fitting room was

276
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,227
and had her take you there and made her see the white sandals

277
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:24,127
in front of the fitting room to the very right.

278
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:26,627
Then after the salesclerk went back to her post,

279
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,227
you went into the fitting room in the middle,

280
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,227
and soaked the chloroform that you had in the straw

281
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:34,427
onto the face cover and put it back in the box.

282
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:36,727
Then if you go into the fitting room to the left,

283
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,427
you're all set to go!

284
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,127
You looked out the curtain

285
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:42,927
and waited for the victim to come to the fitting room.

286
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:45,927
Then you listened for the sound of the victim to fall on the floor

287
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,228
after inhaling the chloroform on the face cover.

288
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:52,527
And after confirming that nobody was around

289
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:56,127
you entered the middle fitting room where the victim was.

290
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:59,927
Then you wrapped the rope that you brought around the victim's neck

291
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:02,227
and strangled her to death!

292
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:06,427
You waited for Ms. Nitsuka, who had been watching the fitting room,

293
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:09,327
to go back to the floor,

294
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,927
stretched your hand out from the space between the curtain

295
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:15,427
and retrieved the white sandals and the cell phone.

296
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:19,527
After confirming Ms. Nitsuka going into the fitting room to the right,

297
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,527
you went back into the fitting room to the left.

298
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,027
Then you removed the ribbon from the white sandals

299
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,827
and wrapped it onto the gift box.

300
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:30,627
You put the insole that remained into your own shoe.

301
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,727
You actually wanted to leave the fitting

302
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:34,927
and get away from the crime scene

303
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,927
but the salesclerk found the victim's body

304
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,828
before you could do so, right?

305
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:45,727
So what was the shape that the victim made with both her hands?

306
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:48,727
Oh. She put lipstick on the thumb of her right hand

307
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,627
and made a fist...

308
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:51,927
To make a flag!

309
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,027
Flag?

310
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,827
Yep! The flag of China!

311
00:16:55,828 --> 00:17:00,927
The victim originally had manicure with five stars on them.

312
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,627
She colored the area around the stars red with her lipstick

313
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,827
to make it look like the flag of China, maybe?

314
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:10,027
But, why China?

315
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:14,427
The way they use their fingers to count in China is a bit odd.

316
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:17,027
They count from one to ten with just one hand.

317
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:18,627
One hand?

318
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:22,127
From one to five, it's counted the same way as in Japan.

319
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:25,127
But six is this, and seven is this.

320
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,027
And eight is this!

321
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:31,127
Hey. That's...

322
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:34,927
Oh, I see! So this would make...

323
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,428
The eight as is Ms. Yamaki's name in kanji character!

324
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:44,127
I see. Since the victim traveled worldwide,

325
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:47,927
she also knew how they counted in China.

326
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,427
Well, if there were a lot of dog hair

327
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,027
on the floor of the site of the crime,

328
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,327
if you check the soles of Ms. Yamaki's feet,

329
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,727
there should be a few of them stuck on.

330
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:00,428
The hair of the dog that the victim owned.

331
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:09,327
You don't have to check because I have dog hair on me.

332
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:13,627
I seem to have been the president's pet, you see.

333
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,127
Pet?

334
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,627
A few months ago,

335
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,927
I came here to buy clothes with the president.

336
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,627
The president and I coincidentally happened to try on the same clothes.

337
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,927
Oh, my?

338
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:28,527
Are you thinking of wearing that to the next party?

339
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:34,127
Yes. But if you're going to wear it, I'll wear something else.

340
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,227
Oh, no problem!

341
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,027
I'm not going to wear it.

342
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,927
You go ahead and wear it.

343
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,927
Thank you!

344
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,327
She's a good president.

345
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,827
True.

346
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:49,627
The president didn't wear that outfit

347
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:55,827
but she had it remade into an outfit for her dog.

348
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:57,827
Oh, no. Ms. Yamaki.

349
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:00,327
You're wearing the same clothes as my dog.

350
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:03,027
That choker looks like a collar too.

351
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:06,028
Would you like me to get a leash for you?

352
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:14,628
You're going to be my pet to eternity.

353
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:21,927
I thought about going to some other companies too

354
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:25,427
but since I had debts that I owed the president I couldn't.

355
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:29,028
That's why I killed her, before she killed me.

356
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,628
So she couldn't own me till I died.

357
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,627
Case closed.

358
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:07,727
A case like that is duck soup with Conan and me around!

359
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,027
Right, Conan?

360
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:13,227
All I did was make sandals using ribbons.

361
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,627
Just as would be expected of The High School Girls' Detective Squad!

362
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:18,027
You're a high school detective too, aren't you, Sonoko?

363
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,327
You call yourself the Deduction Queen after all.

364
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:24,827
Well, the thing is, I don't get inspirations at all recently.

365
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:28,827
I used to feel a tingling feeling by my neck before

366
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:32,727
but I haven't fired the tranquilizer gun at Sonoko for a while now.

367
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:38,227
But, I didn't know that Germany and France counted like this.

368
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:41,727
Oh, Shinichi used to do that a lot too!

369
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:44,927
He said it's because his mother had a habit of counting that way.

370
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:49,727
Yeah. That's right, because Mom used to favor fashionable French people.

371
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:52,127
Hey, kid!

372
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:54,627
Is the number three shaped like this in Europe?

373
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:59,527
No. I saw on TV that even in Europe, there are exceptions.

374
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,727
Britain counts the same way as Japan

375
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,227
and to gesture the number three,

376
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:09,428
they erect the index finger, middle and ring finger in that order!

377
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:14,128
I though so! Right!

378
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:18,027
Come to think of it,

379
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:21,127
back during the case of "Red Woman", Sera...

380
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:24,027
It sure is a thin bat, though.

381
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,427
Can you hit balls with that?

382
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,227
She was saying something like that but...

383
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:30,927
Maybe she was referring to cricket,

384
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:33,527
a sport popular in Britain.

385
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:34,927
Because the bats of cricket

386
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:37,727
unlike baseball bats are flat and thick.

387
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:39,727
Besides, when eating,

388
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:42,227
in American table manners, after cutting the food with the knife,

389
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,727
the fork is re-held in the right hand!

390
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:49,627
In Japan and Britain, the fork is not re-held in the right hand.

391
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:51,127
Wait a second.

392
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,927
Sera also said...

393
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:59,727
I can also tell that Conan is pretty good at playing football too.

394
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:04,027
In America, they don't call soccer as "football".

395
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:06,427
Which means there's no mistake about it!

396
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:10,927
Sera studied abroad, not in America, but in Britain.

397
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:14,628
But, why is Sera hiding the fact that she went to Britain?

398
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,327
Hold on...

399
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:20,428
Britain...

400
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,828
Britain...

401
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:30,928
Britain...

402
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:35,028
I see!

403
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,628
I remember it now!

404
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:44,627
"Next Episode"

405
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,427
Thanks for coming.

406
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,027
I was waiting for you.

407
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:53,027
Hey, didn't you just see something yellow?

408
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:56,227
I saw it! But it disappeared right away.

409
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:59,828
The master said that a ghost appears.

410
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:03,628
So, that's the story.

411
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:12,528
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad and the Haunted House"
