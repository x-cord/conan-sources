1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,444
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:04,244
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:05,744
Today's episode is the 300th.

4
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:06,944
We want to show our appreciation to our fans

5
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:07,945
with a touching solution.

6
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:09,544
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:11,344
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,645
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:58,023
Kogoro, Ran and I travel to the Kanmon Strait

10
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,923
which connects Honshu and Kyushu,

11
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:04,924
we meet a group of four former high school classmates there.

12
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:11,523
The next day, another classmate,

13
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:16,123
Seiji Hario is found dead.

14
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,723
The police suspect the four at first

15
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,823
but their alibis check out

16
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,523
and they are cleared.

17
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:26,724
But...

18
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,623
I've got it.

19
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:42,224
I know how to break their alibis now.

20
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:52,224
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 2)"

21
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:56,223
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station."

22
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:58,823
Something's bothering me though.

23
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,423
What is it?

24
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:03,523
Hey listen, that surveillance camera you mentioned,

25
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:05,423
is it the ceiling type?

26
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,723
You were made a peace sign.

27
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,924
Why you... Stop butting in...

28
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,124
Ceiling type?

29
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:15,924
Peace.

30
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,323
"Human Tunnel (Shimonoseki side) Entrance."

31
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,723
What did you say?

32
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:26,223
Are you telling me you didn't get a clear look at his face?

33
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:30,923
Yeah, the camera's aimed at an angle.

34
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:34,023
But I'm sure it was him

35
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,523
because he was wearing the same clothes

36
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,224
in the picture you showed me.

37
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,123
But...

38
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:43,923
If you didn't see his face,

39
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,923
you don't know for sure it was him.

40
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,923
Conan! When'd you sneak in here?

41
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:54,923
But Mr. Mouri, what if this man wasn't really Mr. Hario?

42
00:03:54,924 --> 00:04:00,223
Yes. He might have been killed way before this

43
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:06,024
which means, anyone of those four could have committed the murder.

44
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,723
"Karato Pier"

45
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:14,423
I want to apologize for calling you out like this.

46
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,923
It's alright. But why me?

47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,023
It's my father's fault.

48
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:23,123
I think he still suspects you and your friends.

49
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,523
"Eiko Nojima (30)"

50
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,523
I see.

51
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:31,423
That Seiji Hario was a horrible guy himself, wasn't he?

52
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:34,523
He was responsible for breaking you and Hondo up

53
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,123
and yet he said he didn't know who Hondo was.

54
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:40,024
I'm sure Hondo can't rest in peace.

55
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,823
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,523
No need to apologize.

57
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,523
Pitiful, aren't I?

58
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,923
Calling you out to talk about something like this.

59
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:58,223
You're in love with someone, aren't you, Ran?

60
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,524
No. I mean...

61
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,223
I wonder what those people are doing over there?

62
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:07,323
That lighthouse is known as "The Lovers' Lighthouse".

63
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,623
The Lovers' Lighthouse?

64
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:13,523
When lovers place their hands on the lighthouse together and pray,

65
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:17,524
they'll be able to overcome any obstacle and be married.

66
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:29,424
Eiko.

67
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,723
Have you been on the ropeway?

68
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,124
The one at Hinoyama.

69
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,023
No.

70
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,723
Why don't we go now?

71
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,223
Okay.

72
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:43,423
"Karato Marketplace."

73
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,623
Yes. No mistake about it.

74
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:50,023
Mr. Akitaya got a call right after he got here.

75
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:53,623
He got here a little before 11 am, I think.

76
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,523
And if I remember right, we were talking for about an hour.

77
00:05:56,524 --> 00:06:01,524
I guess Mr. Akitaya was telling us the truth.

78
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,123
So where's this Kaikyokan?

79
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:06,723
On the other side of the bridge.

80
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:09,623
It's about a five minute walk from here.

81
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:13,323
You mean this marketplace where Mr. Akitaya was

82
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,723
and the ferry landing where Mr. Otsubo was

83
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:18,223
and Kaikyokan where Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka

84
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,424
were are all within walking distance.

85
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:31,323
Yes, I remember these two very well.

86
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,423
They were both so pretty,

87
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:37,824
they called someone from that walkway.

88
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:42,724
Then they went to watch the performing seal act at 11 am.

89
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:46,024
So that means...

90
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:52,323
Excuse me, Miss.

91
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,523
That man you were just talking to sent me here

92
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,523
to ask you something he forgot.

93
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,424
What is it, kid?

94
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,023
The employee over there didn't remember Mr. Otsubo either.

95
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,923
I knew it.

96
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:11,923
But Mr. Mouri,

97
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:16,423
Akane Isaka and Eiko Nojima saw him get on the 11 o'clock ferry

98
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:20,223
from over there.

99
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:24,323
But Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo are engaged to each other.

100
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:29,823
But Eiko Nojima claims she saw him too.

101
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,424
That's what I don't understand.

102
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:36,623
Conan! Are you still following us around?

103
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:41,723
I noticed Ms. Nojima only uses her glasses when she's driving.

104
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:43,323
Glasses?

105
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,523
When she was leaving the police station yesterday,

106
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:49,223
she put her glasses on when she got in the car.

107
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,923
What?

108
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,023
When I asked at the aquarium,

109
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,523
they told me she wasn't wearing glasses then.

110
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:58,824
I guess she only needs them to look at things that are far away.

111
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:03,523
That's it. They used her.

112
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,223
They used her.

113
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,723
What do you mean?

114
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:09,724
"Hinoyama Ropeway."

115
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:19,323
Is that right?

116
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,723
Yes.

117
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,524
Wow, this is fantastic.

118
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,023
Did you and Hondo come here on your dates?

119
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,523
Yes.

120
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:34,224
He and I didn't like crowded places.

121
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,423
The others,

122
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:50,924
Akitaya, Otsubo and Akane were always watching over us.

123
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,623
How nice...

124
00:08:56,624 --> 00:09:00,223
You were all very close, weren't you?

125
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,223
I can't understand how father can suspect such nice people like you,

126
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:05,824
he's awful.

127
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:12,124
I'm the one that's awful.

128
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,023
What was that?

129
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,523
Are you saying Mr. Akitaya, Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka

130
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,323
worked together and killed Mr. Hario?

131
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:21,723
That's right.

132
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:27,123
Then they came up with fool proof alibis using Ms. Nojima.

133
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,223
Are you sure?

134
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:33,523
The Mr. Otsubo that Ms. Nojima says she saw from here was a fake.

135
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,623
He was an imposter.

136
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,123
-An imposter. -An imposter. But...

137
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:41,223
how do you know only the three of them were in on it?

138
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:44,723
Wouldn't it be logical to assume

139
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,923
that Ms. Nojima was in on it too?

140
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:52,123
She and Ms. Isaka met in front of this aquarium.

141
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,723
We know it's true because we have witnesses.

142
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,423
If she was in with them,

143
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:01,523
she and Ms. Isaka would have come here together.

144
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:07,123
Because that would give them time to work out their plan.

145
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:08,823
I see what you mean.

146
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:12,123
Can you get those four together again?

147
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:14,723
I'll explain everything then.

148
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:16,124
I'll get right on it.

149
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,224
Yes. Anzai here.

150
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:24,323
What did you say?

151
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,923
What's wrong?

152
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,023
It seems Ms. Nojima just turned herself in

153
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,923
for the murder of Mr. Hario.

154
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,023
Eiko Nojima?

155
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,224
I don't understand.

156
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:43,024
This morning, I think it was about 10:00 am.

157
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,223
I went to the hotel Seiji was staying at

158
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:49,123
and asked to talk to him.

159
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,924
I took him to the area near the Kanmon Bridge.

160
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:56,223
To the same place Hondo committed suicide 12 years ago

161
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,423
when his dream was taken away by Hario.

162
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,423
At that same place,

163
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:05,423
I asked him

164
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:07,423
to apologize to Hondo,

165
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,623
even if it was one just word.

166
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,323
But, he...

167
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,924
just laughed.

168
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,224
He did it to himself, it's all his fault.

169
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:23,824
Why should I apologize to a piece of trash like him for?

170
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,724
Before I realized what I was doing, I...

171
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:48,124
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

172
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:57,923
After she hit him, he fell and then stopped moving?

173
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,723
Then I wonder why...

174
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:04,423
What made you turn yourself in?

175
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:09,123
I never imagined Akitaya or the others would be involved in this.

176
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:14,024
I didn't want to drag them into this on my account.

177
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:20,523
I still want to talk to the other three.

178
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:25,523
Mr. Mouri, you still think those three were in on it too, don't you?

179
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:28,823
There're too many things that can't be explained clearly.

180
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:33,723
Then why is Ms. Nojima insisting she did it herself?

181
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,323
To protect them.

182
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:39,623
They're all former classmates,

183
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:42,724
she probably thinks friendship means she has to protect them.

184
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:48,423
That's it. That explains everything.

185
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:49,924
That means...

186
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,123
So a call came in on their cellular

187
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:58,223
and all of a sudden they got shocked?

188
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:03,523
Yes. Then they both ran out of here.

189
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,824
I knew it.

190
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:10,431
Then that person's the only one who could've done it.

191
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:18,937
Eiko Nojima has confessed that she alone is responsible

192
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:21,838
for the death of Seiji Hario, but...

193
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,038
I do not believe her.

194
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:31,837
Toru Akitaya. Keisuke Otsubo. Akane Isaka.

195
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:34,538
You three killed him.

196
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:38,837
Now wait just a minute.

197
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:40,637
Just sit down.

198
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:42,838
You'll have a chance to talk later.

199
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:47,537
Mr. Akitaya, you hated Mr. Hario

200
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,537
because of the unexpected and unfair news of your company's buy out.

201
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,837
That was probably your motive.

202
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:57,737
And Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

203
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,537
went along with your plan out of deep friendship.

204
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,337
Slightly past 10 am,

205
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:05,237
you three called Mr. Hario out

206
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:07,937
and killed him by the Kanmon Bridge.

207
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:12,537
Then you worked up very detailed alibis.

208
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:15,437
Mr. Otsubo dressed himself up as Mr.Hario

209
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,737
and Mr. Akitaya dressed himself up as Mr. Otsubo.

210
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:24,437
Then Ms. Isaka called Ms. Nojima and asked her to meet her.

211
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:31,037
At 10:50 am, the two meet in front of Kaikyokan.

212
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,738
Look, it's Otsubo.

213
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:38,537
Ms. Isaka made Ms. Nojima think.

214
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:43,137
Mr. Otsubo was getting on the 11:00 am ferry.

215
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:47,037
But, the person on the landing

216
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:50,838
was actually Mr. Akitaya wearing Mr. Otsubo's clothes.

217
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:56,538
They used the fact that she had poor eyesight.

218
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:05,537
Of course Mr. Akitaya never got on that ferry.

219
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,337
He hid Mr. Otsubo's clothes somewhere

220
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:11,937
then went to the Karato Marketplace for his meeting.

221
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:15,338
Then at the 11:00 am, the appointed time.

222
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:19,937
Mr. Otsubo, disguised as Mr. Hario,

223
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:21,937
makes the call to Mr. Akitaya.

224
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,637
What do you mean his ghost?

225
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,538
I've heard enough nonsense.

226
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:37,037
They made it look like Mr. Hario was killed after 11 am

227
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:40,537
so that they could all have alibis.

228
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:44,837
Mr. Otsubo disguised himself as Mr. Hario who was already dead

229
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:49,837
and Mr. Akitaya disguised himself as Mr. Otsubo giving him his alibi.

230
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,737
Ms. Isaka used Ms. Nojima's poor eyesight

231
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:55,537
to backup Mr. Otsubo's alibi.

232
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,938
And that's how they worked it.

233
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,037
He's wrong.

234
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:03,437
That's awful. You're all friends,

235
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:05,737
how could you use Eiko like that?

236
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,337
No, Ran, you're mistaken.

237
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,937
Mr. Mouri, you're wrong.

238
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:12,037
I killed Hario.

239
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,338
But Ms. Nojima...

240
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:20,337
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,537
Is this the Sleeping Kogoro pose I've heard so much about?

242
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:26,137
But the case's already solved...

243
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,837
90 percent of what I just said is true

244
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:32,937
but I need to make a few corrections.

245
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,837
Are you trying to say Mr. Akitaya and his friends

246
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,437
weren't in it together?

247
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:41,237
I thought they were at first

248
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,837
but that turned out to be a mistake.

249
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,637
-A mistake. -Conan!

250
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,637
A little past 10 this morning,

251
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:52,037
Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo were shopping in Moji

252
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,337
when Ms. Isaka got a call on her cellular.

253
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:58,838
The two of them got very shocked and they ran out of the store.

254
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:02,537
Mr. Otsubo, Ms. Isaka.

255
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:06,337
That call was from Mr. Akitaya, wasn't it?

256
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,038
He told you Ms. Nojima had killed Mr. Hario, right?

257
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,437
Mr. Akitaya probably went to see Mr. Hario

258
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:18,638
about his company's buy out.

259
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:25,337
When he got there,

260
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:28,137
he saw Ms. Nojima has gotten there first

261
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,737
and was taking him somewhere.

262
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,437
He was worried about her

263
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,137
so he followed them,

264
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,938
that's when he witnessed it.

265
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,237
Mr. Akitaya called you and told you what happened

266
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:50,538
and when you two found out, you rushed over there.

267
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,537
The three of you then thought you had to do something

268
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,437
to protect Ms. Nojima,

269
00:17:56,438 --> 00:18:00,438
that's when you thought of what I explained earlier.

270
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,437
They did it for me.

271
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:12,238
Of course. After all, we're all friends, aren't we?

272
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,737
Then who is the murderer?

273
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,537
Like I've been saying from the start, I did it.

274
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,437
Did you hit him twice?

275
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:28,438
Twice?

276
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,937
There are indications

277
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:35,337
the victim was struck twice in the back of the head.

278
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,837
That can't be.

279
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,637
I only hit him once.

280
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:44,137
Ms. Nojima, I have no doubt you struck Mr. Hario.

281
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:48,337
But that blow didn't kill him.

282
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:52,637
You ran away thinking that you'd killed him.

283
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:55,838
But he later regained consciousness.

284
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,338
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

285
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,837
Mr. Hario was really killed

286
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:10,837
by the fatal blow delivered

287
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,437
after he regained consciousness.

288
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:17,237
And person who could have done it

289
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:21,237
is the one who stayed behind after Ms. Nojima had left,

290
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,938
Mr. Akitaya, it was you.

291
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:42,538
Darn, that Eiko...

292
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,638
You'll pay for this.

293
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:55,837
Yes, you're right.

294
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:58,638
It was me, I killed Hario.

295
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,937
But... how...

296
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:08,637
how did you know he regained consciousness?

297
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:14,037
There was a lot of dirt and grass on the tips of his fingernails

298
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,737
and there were scratches on his fingertips

299
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:19,237
like they'd clutched the ground.

300
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:22,437
But according to Ms Nojima's statement...

301
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:28,137
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

302
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:29,237
If that were the case though,

303
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:32,237
his fingers wouldn't be in the condition they were.

304
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,437
And that's what told me,

305
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:39,538
Mr. Hario had regained consciousness after Ms. Nojima had left,

306
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:43,537
he clutched his head with his left hand

307
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,137
and put all his strength into his right hand

308
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,638
to pull himself up, he made several attempts...

309
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:54,938
and that's when the fatal blow was delivered.

310
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:00,237
The company...

311
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:02,937
I couldn't stand the thought of him buying it,

312
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:06,237
that's why I did it.

313
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,437
Are you sure...

314
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:10,738
that was your only reason?

315
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,937
If you hadn't done what you did,

316
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,537
I'm sure he would have gone to the police

317
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:17,637
and told them what Ms. Nojima had done.

318
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:21,437
You wanted to protect her.

319
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:24,338
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

320
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:28,838
Akitaya...

321
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:36,337
Still, it doesn't matter what the motive was

322
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,237
or what kind of person he was,

323
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:41,737
no human being should take another's life,

324
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:44,038
it's unforgivable.

325
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,738
Shinichi?

326
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:38,738
Shin...

327
