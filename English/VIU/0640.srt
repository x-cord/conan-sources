such as peaches and grapes are local specialties.

It looks delicious.

There's an ample amount of white peaches

Just as would be expected of Okayama, the place famous for peaches.

makes a great difference in the response we get from the readers.

44
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,305
You mean to tell me that maybe I was chosen

45
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,505
because I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter?

46
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,205
I guess so.

Let go.

72

Police?

74
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,405
Wait.

75
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,805
Ouch... my head hurts.

77
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,605
No, stay away.

00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:53,505
Pursued? Me?

80
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,805
No good. Nothing...

81
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,605
I can't remember anything!

82
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,305
My head hurts.

83
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:03,605
What's your name, miss?

84
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:05,605
Where did you come from?

85
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:08,305
My name... I can't remember.

86
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,705
I don't know.

87
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:10,805
She.

88
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,005
What's the matter?

89
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,405
My, she's the person we saw a while ago...

90
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,005
Ran, call the ambulance.

91
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,005
Yes.

92
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:35,605
Darn.

93
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:39,005
I didn't get to eat my octopus rice.

94
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,805
What the heck's going on?

95
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:49,205
Post-traumatic amnesia?

96
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:53,605
It seems to be a sudden onset of memory loss caused by trauma.

97
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:56,405
There are bruises on her body too.

98
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,405
Will she be able to regain her memory?

99
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:00,805
I can't say for sure.

100
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,305
Fortunately, there seems to be no damage to her brain,

101
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,405
so all I can say is the possibility is not all that low.

102
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,905
And...

103
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:12,005
Didn't she have anything on her that could be used as identification?

104
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,705
Dad, what took you so long?

105
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,305
How about it?

106
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,405
She didn't have anything on her.

107
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,705
She had no cell phone, I.D. or wallet on her.

108
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:23,105
Did you contact the police?

109
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:27,305
Of course, and we were being questioned until a while ago.

110
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,205
They said they'd investigate just to be safe,

111
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,505
but that it's questionable

112
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,005
whether there's any criminal activity involved.

113
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,805
Which means, I'm not in need.

114
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,305
Okay, octopus rice here I go.

115
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,005
But you've got a job request.

116
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:41,705
Job request?

117
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:44,105
Mr. Mouri... I believe?

118
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:49,205
Yes. I'm the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

119
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:53,805
Please... Please investigate who and where I'm from.

120
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,205
Please.

121
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,405
Yes.

122
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,805
So, pops officially accepted her request

123
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:06,605
and proceeded investigation of her past but...

124
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:11,105
I asked her to draw a sketch of whatever came to mind.

125
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:14,605
It's uncertain whether they are correlated in any way,

126
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,005
but I think it's safe to say

127
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,705
that they are all parts of memory.

128
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,305
Incomprehensible.

129
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:25,905
Isn't this a bird? A crane?

130
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,605
I got it. It's a red-crowned crane.

131
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:31,105
This symbolizes the Kourakuen Garden.

132
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:35,705
That's where we first heard her sing the song Evening Primrose.

133
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,405
And, doesn't this one look like a cat?

134
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,805
True.

135
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:45,805
Speaking of a black cat...

136
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,705
Right. Yumeji Takehisa.

137
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:52,305
Right. The Yumeji Takehisa Art Museum.

138
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:53,805
You remember it, don't you?

139
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,705
Yes, I do.

140
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,505
But, why was I in such a place?

141
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,905
I see, she still can't remember the critical fact that we seek.

142
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,905
But there're things we did find out.

143
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:10,305
All these sketches are undoubtedly of places that you've been.

144
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,205
The places I've been to?

145
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:14,405
Yes. I can't be all that sure,

146
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,805
but that is a possibility.

147
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,205
What other things can you figure out?

148
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:20,105
This is a peach, isn't it?

149
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:23,405
And this one is grapes?

150
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,705
It could be.

151
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:27,605
But since both are local specialties,

152
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,805
it's difficult to specify the location.

153
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,805
We've got one more clue to go on.

154
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,405
That cell phone.

155
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:38,605
Please, let me listen to it once more.

156
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,005
Who the heck are you?

157
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,105
Please.

158
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:45,005
Yes, I remember that too,

159
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:50,005
but I still can't remember why I did something like that.

160
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,505
Leave it to me.

161
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:57,805
I, Kogoro Mouri will cut the Gordian Knot

162
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,805
and help get your memory back.

163
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:00,905
Excuse me.

164
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:05,505
Oh, no. I'm sorry, I've got to write my article.

165
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,105
Well... I just got word from the editor

166
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:10,505
to slightly change the contents of the article.

167
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,705
Change?

168
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,305
Just what do you mean?

169
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,705
We're going to upload her picture,

170
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,705
sketches that she'd drawn

171
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,105
as well as the Great Detective Sleeping Kogoro

172
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:28,005
investigating the case on our Town Magazine Website.

173
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:29,605
I'm sure we'll get great response.

174
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,705
But, is it going to be all right?

175
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,205
What about your all important report on sweets?

176
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:36,005
Sweets and mystery,

177
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,605
we're continuing on with these two topics.

178
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,605
As for me, I'd like to go with just one topic, sweets though.

179
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:49,305
"Okayama Electric Tramway" -We attempted to retrace her memories

180
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:52,605
based on her sketches

181
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,405
but, aside from the red-crowned crane and the black cat,

182
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,605
we failed to find places matching her sketches.

183
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,005
She wasn't able to regain her memory either.

184
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,005
We're being followed?

185
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,905
If I'm not mistaken, back then...

186
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,405
Ran, call an ambulance.

187
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:16,405
Okay.

188
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:19,105
The same person?

189
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:20,105
Okay, then.

190
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:26,505
Conan, not that way.

191
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:27,605
Shoots.

192
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:34,305
Darn it.

193
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:41,005
What's the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,805
Nope, it's nothing.

195
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,305
Is anything the matter?

196
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,305
Did you recall something new?

197
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,305
Quiet.

198
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,105
Where?

199
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,705
Where is this sound coming from?

200
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,605
See, it's recorded all right.

201
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,405
How beautiful.

202
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:15,905
Please let me listen to it.

203
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,005
Yes, go ahead.

204
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,305
Grandma.

205
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:26,205
Where did you record that?

206
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,705
This was from...

207
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,605
"Nozaki former residence" -It was from the Nozaki residence

208
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,605
who made a fortune from the salt farm business.

209
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:36,205
Their residence was also known as the "Salt Palace."

210
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,105
"Water Zither Cave Suikinkutsu"

211
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:50,305
Suikinkutsu...

212
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,805
is composed of an urn buried underground

213
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,105
with an open hole atop

214
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,105
allowing droplets from the water basin to drip through

215
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,505
and echo inside,

216
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,405
it's a refined device uniquely found

217
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,605
in Japanese gardens, it says.

218
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,005
It sounds really beautiful.

219
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:08,005
So, you're certain that you heard this sound here?

220
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:10,905
Yes. Most likely.

221
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,105
But...

222
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,605
You still can't remember why you came here, right?

223
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,805
No.

224
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,905
Mayuko?

225
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,705
Where were you?

226
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,905
I was looking for you all this time.

227
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,105
It's me, Kanae.

228
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,905
Your friend.

229
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,905
Kanae?

230
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,005
That's right, Mayuko.

231
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,805
Mayuko?

232
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,641
"Mayuko Kichise (25)" -Mayuko Kichise is my name?

233
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:51,041
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -Yes, you're Kanae Nonomiya's friend, my friend.

234
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,141
Kanae, my friend.

235
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,059
We got some response on our website too.

236
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:02,159
She is Ms. Mayuko Kichise who works at a cafe in Okayama City.

237
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,559
The customers and staff at the cafe are posting.

238
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,159
There's no mistake about it.

239
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,459
That's where I got to know Mayuko too.

240
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,759
What about her family?

241
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,459
Her parents.

242
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,859
Something about they died of an illness when she was little.

243
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,559
She seems to have no relatives either,

244
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,259
and I've heard before that she was completely alone.

245
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,059
How about it?

246
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,959
Now do you remember something?

247
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,759
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,559
No good?

249
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,059
You said that you were looking all over for Mayuko, didn't you?

250
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,659
Yes. But, I had no idea that she had amnesia.

251
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,459
What shall I do?

252
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,659
If she stays as is, my older brother will...

253
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,659
What's this about your older brother?

254
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,159
Please, Mayuko.

255
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,359
Please try to remember.

256
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,959
My older brother... Please help him.

257
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,459
The night before yesterday,

258
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,159
from this jewelry store in Okayama City,

259
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,859
three billion yen worth of valuables were stolen

260
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,359
and the man arrested as a suspect was,

261
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:12,059
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -Mr. Keigo Nonomiya, Kanae's older brother.

262
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,459
According to the news,

263
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,159
the police found him unconscious

264
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,559
in front of the emergency exit beside the store.

265
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,059
At that time, part of the jewelry that was stolen,

266
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,759
was found in his possession.

267
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,159
Since my brother had a previous record of theft,

268
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,959
they arrested on charges of being one of the robbers in the group.

269
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,359
But when I visited him at the police,

270
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,559
my brother definitely told me that he was innocent.

271
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,659
My brother just happened to pass by that road.

272
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,159
Then he was attacked by the culprit there,

273
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,759
and set up as a scapegoat.

274
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,159
And...

275
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,859
I... witnessed that?

276
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:57,059
He said, "She's undoubtedly your friend Mayuko."

277
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,159
"She's the only one that can prove my innocence,

278
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,759
so please have her testify."

279
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,059
That's why I kept on looking for her.

280
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,459
Is that so?

281
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,359
Mayuko, can't you remember anything?

282
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,559
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,359
Leave everything to me.

284
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,559
You can count on me, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

285
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,759
Mayuko's loss of memory

286
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,459
may be due to the fact that the culprit came

287
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,659
after her to shut her up.

288
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,859
I see. That's possible.

289
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:32,259
If you regain your memory,

290
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,159
the robbery case will be solved.

291
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,159
We'll be killing two birds with one stone.

292
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,059
Do you know where Mayuko lives?

293
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:41,859
Yes, of course.

294
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,859
That's it. If we go there,

295
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,759
we may be able to come up with something.

296
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,359
Mayuko explained the situation to the landlord,

297
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:53,659
and we decided to investigate Mayuko's room.

298
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,959
Look.

299
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,659
This is...

300
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:02,959
Isn't this one side of Mayuko's pierced earring?

301
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,859
Which means she fell down these stairs and lost her memory?

302
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,059
What's going on here?

303
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,859
This is a badge?

304
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:39,359
The person in this picture most probably messed this place up.

305
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,659
From the looks of the photo,

306
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,359
could he be her boyfriend?

307
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,059
My room?

308
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,059
My boyfriend?

309
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:53,259
Kanae, have you ever seen this person around Mayuko before.

310
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:58,159
No, because Mayuko never liked to talk about things like that.

311
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,359
I can't... I can't recall anything, my head hurts.

312
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,259
Are you all right?

313
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,259
Don't you think she should rest a while, dad?

314
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:08,959
Yes.

315
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,659
This is an order form for custom made jeans?

316
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,059
The order date is three days ago,

317
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,259
a day before the robbery case.

318
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,759
This shop is famous.

319
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:25,859
We headed for the Betty Smith Museum in Kojima,

320
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:28,459
the district famous for being the place

321
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:32,059
where jeans in Japan originated.

322
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,059
"Betty Smith Museum"

323
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,859
I remember.

324
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:40,159
She did order custom made jeans.

325
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,659
Like the one and only jeans in the world,

326
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,859
I'm going to live a life of my very own.

327
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,759
A life of my very own...

328
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,259
I've heard her say it before too.

329
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,659
Although you were a tomboy from before,

330
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,259
you were prone to believe people immediately, and was usually deceived.

331
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:00,059
Each time you tried to get back on your feet, you were betrayed.

332
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,159
Your life was a repetition of this.

333
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,759
So, you swore to yourself that you would shape up

334
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,559
and said you would start living a life of your very own.

335
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,259
You told me so yourself, Mayuko.

336
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,659
I said something like that?

337
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,059
Shall we head off for lunch?

338
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,659
They have pretty good octopus rice in this area.

339
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,559
Octopus rice sounds good.

340
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:28,659
Wait...

341
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,359
Welcome.

342
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,359
I'll show you the way. So one moment please.

343
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,659
It looks good.

344
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,859
Dad.

345
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,059
Mr. Nashida.

346
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,059
Mr. Taira?

347
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,259
"Kenzo Taira (40)" -Yes, I'm Taira.

348
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,059
Long time no see, Mr. Nashida.

349
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,759
You look really pleasantly different.

350
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,559
How embarrassing.

351
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,259
I don't mean to go through any image change

352
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,859
or something like that.

353
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,759
The fact is, I'm thinking of turning a new leaf,

354
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,759
and open up a new shop soon.

355
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,359
That's really something.

356
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,959
I'll report it on the next article.

357
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,459
Let me introduce him.

358
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:21,459
He's Mr. Kenzo Taira, a pastry maker living in Okayama.

359
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:26,259
Mr. Nashida, you used to be a famous sommelier yourself too.

360
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,559
Thanks to the wine you chose for me,

361
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,859
I was able to make masterpiece sweets.

362
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,159
Is that right?

363
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,659
How embarrassing.

364
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,059
The fact is while being in charge of gourmet articles

365
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,359
for the Town Magazine,

366
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,459
I'm waiting for a chance to make a comeback.

367
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,159
I'll be seeing you, then.

368
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,059
Oh, yes, see you.

369
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,259
Hello, editor.

370
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,459
Right now?

371
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,059
Yes, sir.

372
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,059
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

373
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,159
I'll be back in about an hour,

374
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,059
so please go on and eat without me.

375
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,159
All right.

376
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,459
I see.

377
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,059
This is, if you take a good look at it,

378
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,159
doesn't it look like a rice cooker?

379
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
Now that you mentioned it.

380
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,659
It could be a fragment of your memory of having eaten somewhere.

381
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,059
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,059
I can't remember anything after all.

383
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,259
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,059
-Mayuko, please wait. -Hey, wait.

385
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,359
Dad.

386
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,359
Conan.

387
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,759
This is?

388
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,059
If you want to know of your past, find a place to be alone.

389
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,859
Conan!

390
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,159
Conan.

391
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,859
"No matter how long I wait"

392
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:13,459
"Seto Ohashi Bridge" -"No matter how long I wait"

393
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:17,859
"He never shows up"

394
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:29,459
"Sad like the evening primrose"

395
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,059
Ms. Mayuko.

396
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,359
Darn.

397
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,759
Are we too late?

398
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,259
I'm going to get my memory back no matter what it takes.

399
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:04,959
The grapes are gone

400
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,959
and there are two bunches bananas instead.

401
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,559
By changing the angle,

402
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,059
a different thing can be seen?

403
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,059
What a beautiful moon.

404
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:17,259
Mr. Mouri, please cut the Gordian knot.

405
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,759
In fact, the culprit was depicted

406
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,659
in the sketches drawn by Mayuko to begin with.

407
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,959
Next Conan,

408
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:28,959
"Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Kurashiki Part)"

409
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,159
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,859
"Grapes".

411
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,059
Isn't there a way to regain loss memory?

412
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,859
I lose my memory at times too.

413
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,959
You know yourself, don't you?
