1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:04,077
Pops received a letter from a mysterious person

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,477
named Komakichi Kurataya saying he wanted to give him a family treasure.

3
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:13,177
Ran and I decided to accompany him to Yamaguchi Prefecture.

4
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,577
"I'll be waiting in front of the large fox"

5
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:19,077
"at the Yuda Hot Springs Station at 3 PM."

6
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:21,178
"Komakichi Kurataya"?

7
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:25,677
This must be a rather substantial treasure!

8
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:28,178
Dad, keep your voice down!

9
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,177
Sorry for all the noise.

10
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,778
Seriously.

11
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,577
"JR Shin-Yamaguchi Station" -We're here, Yamaguchi!

12
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,177
We still have plenty of time until 3 PM.

13
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,377
Then let's do some sightseeing.

14
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,777
Yamaguchi has lots to see,

15
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:56,377
like historic landmarks from the late Edo and restoration periods,

16
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:58,678
and Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution.

17
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,177
Sorry.

18
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:08,177
You were just so beautiful, I couldn't help myself.

19
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:11,377
Are you Kogoro Mouri?

20
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:12,577
What?

21
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:15,877
You're The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

22
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:19,377
It's an honor to run into you here.

23
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,477
Thank you.

24
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,977
I'm...

25
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,477
"Asuka Natsume (28)" -Asuka Natsume.

26
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:28,277
"News Site Reporter" -I'm with the Yamaguchi News Site.

27
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,777
Yamaguchi News Site?

28
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:34,377
We report local news stories online.

29
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:38,177
Have you come to Yamaguchi to investigate a case?

30
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,277
Well, actually...

31
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,977
Dad!

32
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,377
Didn't the letter demand strict secrecy?

33
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,477
Oh, right.

34
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,377
I'm just here to sightseeing.

35
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:54,477
My daughter, Ran, and this kid insisted I bring them.

36
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:55,977
Sightseeing?

37
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,877
In that case, let me show you around.

38
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:01,877
-What? Are you sure? -Yes.

39
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,477
I appreciate it.

40
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,577
This'll be a fun trip.

41
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:09,978
He can never resist a beautiful woman.

42
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:13,377
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

43
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:15,577
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

44
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,477
A beautiful reporter and the treasure of Yamaguchi.

45
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:20,277
There's no way this can end well.

46
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:21,977
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,777
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,478
His name is Detective Conan!

"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Yamaguchi Part)"

50
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,204
"Kozan Park"

51
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,304
During the Muromachi period,

52
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:19,804
Yamaguchi was even more prosperous than Kyoto.

53
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,304
It's also known as "Nishinokyo", or the Kyoto of the West.

54
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,804
A five-story pagoda.

55
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:28,704
That's the Rurikoji Temple five-story pagoda,

56
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:31,404
"Rurikoji Five-story Pagoda" -one of Japan's three greatest pagodas,

57
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,004
along with the ones at Horyuji and Daigoji.

58
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,804
It lights up at night.

59
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:38,104
It's a beautiful sight.

60
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,304
It certainly is beautiful.

61
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,504
Hey.

62
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:45,404
"Chinryutei" -This is the relocated and reconstructed Chinryutei,

63
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:46,405
the detached cottage of the Abe family,

64
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,104
a late Edo period business magnate.

65
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,704
In this room, men like Takamori Saigo and Takayoshi

66
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:55,704
held secret meetings regarding the Satcho Alliance.

67
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,204
I see.

68
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:00,104
In this tiny room?

69
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,504
Standing in this room

70
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:05,605
makes you feel like a patriot of the Meiji Restoration.

71
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:09,204
Mr. Mouri.

72
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,904
What are your plans for this evening?

73
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:15,504
I'm supposed to meet someone named Komakichi Kurataya.

74
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,504
Komakichi Kurataya?

75
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:18,704
Dad!

76
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:20,904
Oh, my bad.

77
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,704
Excuse me. Could you wait here, please?

78
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:26,305
What? Sure.

79
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,004
What's gotten into her?

80
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,505
She must've remembered she had something to do.

81
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,504
Asuka's taking a long time.

82
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,705
Yeah.

83
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:43,805
She's back.

84
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,705
Kogoro Mouri, right?

85
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:54,704
That's me. Who are you?

86
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,304
"Nobuto Washiyama (46)" -I'm Washiyama of the Yamaguchikita Station.

87
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,104
"Hiroshi Tsurumi (27)" -I'm Tsurumi.

88
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,404
The police?

89
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,304
We have a few questions for you.

90
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,904
Could you come down to the station with us?

91
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,004
What?

92
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,905
Hey! What are you doing?

93
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,205
-Dad! -Pops.

94
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:15,105
He's running!

95
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:20,104
Kogoro Mouri, you're not getting away!

96
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:21,504
You're under arrest!

97
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,104
What?

98
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,105
"Yamaguchikita Station"

99
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:26,604
I don't understand!

100
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:30,005
Why am I being arrested?

101
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:34,105
Don't just stand there! Explain yourselves!

102
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,504
"Tetsuya Takajo (38)" -I'm Chief Inspector Takajo.

103
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,404
You will be investigated.

104
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,404
What am I being arrested for?

105
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,904
Interference of public duties.

106
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,504
You tried to flee the scene.

107
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,004
I wasn't trying to run!

108
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:02,204
I heard you're receiving a family treasure from Komakichi Kurataya.

109
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:03,304
What?

110
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:07,204
Komakichi Kurataya is the suspect in an armed robbery

111
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:08,504
that occurred a year ago.

112
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:11,204
Armed robbery?

113
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,104
Using the name Komakichi Kurataya,

114
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:17,904
a shipping agent of Hagi famous during the Edo period,

115
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,604
he entered Japanese-style cafe "Takarada" with a gun,

116
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:28,304
shot the manager, and stole millions of yen worth of Kiecho coins.

117
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:33,204
Komakichi Kurata's family treasure refers to those coins he stole.

118
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:38,304
In other words, you're working with Komakichi.

119
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:39,904
You can't be serious!

120
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,504
I was just told to come here by letter!

121
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,904
I see.

122
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:46,104
Let's see this letter.

123
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,105
You just wait.

124
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:48,805
I'll show you right now.

125
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,505
What?

126
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,704
What's wrong?

127
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:57,804
A detective must respect his clients' confidentiality.

128
00:07:57,805 --> 00:08:00,104
If you want to see it, bring me a warrant.

129
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,105
Search him!

130
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,404
- Hey, stop! Don't touch me! -What should we do, Conan?

131
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:04,804
If we don't do something,

132
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:06,904
they'll think he's working with a robber.

133
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:11,604
We should have Inspector Megure contact the Yamaguchi police.

134
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,804
Wait, officers!

135
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,504
Asuka.

136
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,204
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

137
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,804
I'm the one who reported you to the police.

138
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,904
What?

139
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:26,704
I was worried you'd get caught up in the case.

140
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:31,904
I wanted the police to protect you from Komakichi.

141
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,904
So that's what happened.

142
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:37,704
We're sorry, Mr. Mouri.

143
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:38,804
As long as you understand.

144
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,104
Everyone makes mistakes some...

145
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,205
Hey, wait!

146
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,504
If you arrested me,

147
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:50,604
you must not be making much progress on the robbery investigation.

148
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:52,204
So, what?

149
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,204
Relax.

150
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:59,204
Why don't I, The Great Kogoro Mouri, assist you?

151
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,804
Just because I'm a great detective,

152
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,704
there's no need to be shy.

153
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:06,704
There he goes again.

154
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:10,104
What can a mere detective do?

155
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,204
A mere detective?

156
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:16,004
Investigating the robbery is the police's job.

157
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:19,804
It's not something an incompetent detective should involve himself in.

158
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,604
Have some of Yamaguchi's famous Kawara Soba Noodles,

159
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,505
and go back to Tokyo.

160
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:30,104
That half-wit cop.

161
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:33,404
Don't underestimate The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

162
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,405
"JR Yuda Hot Springs Station"

163
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,704
"JR Yuda Hot Springs Station" -The letter said

164
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:39,904
he'd be waiting in front of this statue at three, right?

165
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:44,004
We missed our chance to discover the identity of Komakichi Kurataya.

166
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,104
Too bad.

167
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,404
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,204
It's my fault for reporting it.

169
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,504
It's not your fault, Asuka.

170
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:55,304
It's the fault of that half-wit Takajo.

171
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:59,804
Anyway, where did the letter from Komakichi go?

172
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:01,604
Oh, that?

173
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,304
I have it.

174
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,904
See?

175
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,404
When did you get this?

176
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:11,304
It seemed important, so I thought I should hold onto it.

177
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:12,504
"Fox's Footprint Hot Springs"

178
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:18,405
But did the robber Komakichi really write that letter?

179
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:22,704
-What? -Don't you think it's weird

180
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,704
for a robber to ask you to come here?

181
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,604
"Fox's Footprint Hot Springs" -You're right.

182
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:30,804
What was his plan?

183
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:35,604
You'd probably have to ask Komakichi for the answer.

184
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,605
Right, Asuka?

185
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,804
What?

186
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:46,204
You're Komakichi Kurataya, aren't you?

187
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:49,404
What? Don't be stupid.

188
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:53,005
How could Asuka be the robber?

189
00:10:58,152 --> 00:11:01,352
How could Asuka be the robber?

190
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,951
That's not what I meant.

191
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:11,151
Asuka sent you the letter under the name Komakichi Kurataya.

192
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:12,551
Hey, kid!

193
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,251
You're talking nonsense!

194
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:21,752
But you only said the name Komakichi Kurataya to Asuka.

195
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:28,352
But Inspector Takajo knew about him giving you his family treasure.

196
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,951
Since I had the letter the whole time,

197
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:36,851
Inspector Takajo couldn't have known about that.

198
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:41,951
Which means he must have heard it from Asuka when she reported you.

199
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:42,952
I'm sorry!

200
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,751
What?

201
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,651
Conan is right.

202
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,751
Asuka, what is the meaning of this?

203
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:53,051
Someone's actually been arrested

204
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,951
for the robbery that happened a year ago.

205
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,551
An accomplice?

206
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,651
No.

207
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,551
A metalworking researcher named Yuichi Fukuhara.

208
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:04,051
Metalworking?

209
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,052
Yes.

210
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,451
He received a request by email

211
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:11,651
"Yuichi Fukuhara (32)" -from someone calling themselves

212
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,051
"Metalworking Researcher" -Komakichi Kurataya.

213
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:18,051
He asked him to recreate a weapon of the Choshu Domain,

214
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,651
to commemorate the Hagi Reverberating Furnace

215
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,151
becoming a world heritage site.

216
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,451
Naturally, as a work of art to appreciate

217
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,552
without any firing capabilities.

218
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:30,651
However, just before being completed,

219
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:34,051
it was stolen from the factory.

220
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:38,551
And modified so it could fire bullets.

221
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,651
Yes.

222
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,051
Then Fukuhara did nothing wrong.

223
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:46,651
No. Ultimately they decided what he did was no different

224
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:48,751
from illegally manufacturing a gun.

225
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:52,152
He received a one year sentence.

226
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:58,551
Just before Fukuhara received the email,

227
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:02,151
I did a story on his factory in Hagi

228
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,352
and posted it on my news site.

229
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,151
The culprit must have seen that

230
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:12,051
and asked Fukuhara to create the gun.

231
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,651
So I'm responsible, too.

232
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,851
I see.

233
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:19,451
But you should've been honest from the start.

234
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,851
Maybe...

235
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:26,951
Asuka knows who the culprit is.

236
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:30,151
Isn't that why you quietly invited the old man to Yamaguchi,

237
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,851
so the culprit wouldn't find out

238
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:35,651
and got him involved in the case?

239
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,151
Is this true?

240
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:43,151
The culprit is a cold-blooded man who has no problem shooting people.

241
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:47,351
If he learns I asked a detective to investigate,

242
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:51,751
he may try to kill me.

243
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,851
I'm so afraid.

244
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,951
I understand the situation.

245
00:13:55,952 --> 00:14:01,151
Asuka, the rest is a detective's job.

246
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,352
Mr. Mouri...

247
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:05,651
Thank you!

248
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,151
No need to thank me.

249
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:10,551
This is a detective's destiny.

250
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,851
The case called me here.

251
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:18,451
I know! Asuka, let's announce on your news site

252
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,351
that I've taken the case.

253
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:23,551
Then he won't have any reason to kill you.

254
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,051
But you...

255
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:27,651
Don't worry.

256
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:30,952
Let the great Kogoro Mouri handle it!

257
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,351
So you're the famous Kogoro Mouri.

258
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:44,151
Asuka filled me in.

259
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:47,851
I heard you're going to solve that case from a year ago.

260
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,451
You can count on me.

261
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:55,252
I've solved several cases the police couldn't handle.

262
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:00,151
Now then, Takarada.

263
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:03,951
The coins were stolen from the storehouse on the second floor, correct?

264
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:05,251
Yes.

265
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,851
Do you remember the culprit's face?

266
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,851
They were dressed so strangely,

267
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,051
that made a stronger impression.

268
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:15,751
Strange how?

269
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:20,351
I know. They were captured on my webcam.

270
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,651
Your webcam?

271
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:22,851
Yes.

272
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:27,151
I installed a few in my garage in place of security cameras

273
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,251
to prevent anyone from messing with my car.

274
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:31,651
This is him.

275
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:34,651
A school uniform and white sash?

276
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:38,451
That certainly is a bit eye-catching for a robber.

277
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,852
What? I've seen this outfit before.

278
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,651
Ran.

279
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,851
Can I see your guidebook?

280
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:49,051
Sure.

281
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,752
-Here. -Thank you.

282
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,651
Found it.

283
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:59,051
Fujiki. Welcome.

284
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,251
You're Kogoro Mouri?

285
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,351
Yes. Who are you?

286
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:06,451
"Yosuke Fujiki (45), Lawyer" -Fujiki, a lawyer.

287
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,651
I've been responsible for managing the family's assets

288
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,651
since previous owner.

289
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,851
Fujiki, did something happen today?

290
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,851
I found a news story online claiming that

291
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:19,951
a detective named Kogoro Mouri would be investigating the case.

292
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:22,151
This is it.

293
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:26,751
Komakichi Kurataya, I hope you're quaking in your boots!

294
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,651
How embarrassing.

295
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:32,251
Mouri, could you stay out of this?

296
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,651
Stay out of this?

297
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:36,251
The previous owner willed that the artworks

298
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:38,451
and knickknacks kept in the storehouse

299
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:42,851
on the second floor should be donated to local institutions.

300
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:46,251
Our work was stopped due to the case,

301
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:50,051
but everything must be removed from the storehouse by next week.

302
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,451
I see.

303
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:54,551
So that's why there was a truck parked outside.

304
00:16:54,552 --> 00:16:55,751
Yes.

305
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,751
The construction happening next door is so loud.

306
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:03,951
I can hardly run the business from ten in the morning until evening.

307
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:07,351
I'd like the case to be solved soon, too.

308
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:08,751
Takarada,

309
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:12,651
even if the case is solved, you may not get your coins back.

310
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:13,751
What?

311
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:17,751
Keicho coins have a nearly 90 percent gold content.

312
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:20,751
If melted down into gold bars,

313
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:23,351
they could be sold.

314
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:27,551
Fujiki, you seem to know a lot about gold.

315
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:30,951
My job involves managing assets.

316
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,551
Mouri, this is for your own good.

317
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,151
The culprit has a gun.

318
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,951
If you want to live,

319
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,451
you should withdraw immediately.

320
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,851
Are you threatening me?

321
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:46,252
No. It's just a warning.

322
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:49,452
Goodbye.

323
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,151
He's suspicious.

324
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:59,651
Hey, Pops.

325
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,651
I think there could be a clue

326
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:04,751
"Hagi" -to solving the case in Hagi.

327
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,351
Hagi?

328
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,451
Inspector Takajo said Komakichi Kurataya

329
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:13,251
was the name of someone who lived in Hagi during the Edo period.

330
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:19,151
And Asuka said the factory of Fukuhara who made the gun is also...

331
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,251
Keep your mouth shut!

332
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:23,851
The case happened here in Yamaguchi City!

333
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,151
Then can Ran and I go to Hagi?

334
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,551
No!

335
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:29,751
Why not?

336
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,251
It takes an hour by bus.

337
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:35,751
As long as we're here, I'd like to visit Hagi.

338
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,851
It's too dangerous for you to go alone!

339
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,151
We'll be fine.

340
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,951
Asuka said she's working in Hagi today.

341
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:45,152
What? Asuka is?

342
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:48,352
"Hagi: Meirin Academy"

343
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,151
Hey, kid! Where's Asuka?

344
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,951
Asuka's collecting information

345
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:55,351
"Shoin Shrine" -at Shoin Shrine right now,

346
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:57,452
so we came here first.

347
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:04,252
We wouldn't want to bother her while she's working.

348
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:10,151
By the way, kid, what are you looking for?

349
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,152
What? Oh, you know...

350
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:20,151
There it is!

351
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:21,652
Haginyan!

352
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:25,651
What's with the costume?

353
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:28,351
It's Haginyan, the mascot of the city of Hagi.

354
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:29,751
Really?

355
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,851
Ran, take a picture of me with Haginyan.

356
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,051
Sure.

357
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:38,051
Seriously. He's still a little kid.

358
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:43,052
Anyway, that mascot sure is dressed strangely.

359
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,952
Dressed strangely...

360
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,352
Strangely...

361
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,051
Hey, Haginyan!

362
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:58,852
Why are you dressed like that?

363
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:04,952
What are you dressed as?

364
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,152
"Kiheitai Haginyan"

365
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:11,751
The Kiheitai!

366
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,051
That's it...

367
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:15,751
The culprit was dressed as Shinsaku Takasugi,

368
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:18,851
the man who formed the Kiheitai.

369
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,151
But why?

370
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,551
How should I know?

371
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:27,451
But dressing as a local hero to commit a robbery is disgraceful.

372
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,351
Hey, kid. Where's Asuka now?

373
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:33,951
She's broadcasting from Takayoshi Kido's former residence.

374
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:36,151
It's within walking distance.

375
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,152
"Takayoshi Kido's Former Residence"

376
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,751
Along with Takamori Saigo and Toshimichi Okubo,

377
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:43,951
Takayoshi Kido was one of three great nobles of the Meiji Restoration.

378
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:48,052
He lived here for twenty years before moving to Edo.

379
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:50,751
Hey, Ran.

380
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:54,451
We should probably call Asuka soon.

381
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,552
Yeah.

382
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,051
Hello?

383
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,251
Asuka, it's Takarada.

384
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:04,751
I'm calling you by video call.

385
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:06,452
Oh, sorry.

386
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,451
Hello.

387
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,251
How's your day going?

388
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:15,251
Fujiki just came rushing to the shop.

389
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:18,951
He must be flustered since he heard The Great Detective Mouri

390
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,751
is investigating the case.

391
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,751
So it was him.

392
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:26,351
Darn it. We're lost.

393
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,551
It should be around here.

394
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,951
Are you looking for someplace?

395
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:34,651
We're trying to get to Takayoshi Kido's former residence, but we're lost.

396
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,651
Oh, that's nearby.

397
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:40,451
I could take you there in my rickshaw.

398
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:43,151
Yes, nice.

399
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,952
I'll test its comfort first.

400
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,252
What a nice view.

401
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,851
Ran, get down!

402
00:21:56,852 --> 00:21:58,752
Hey, don't touch that!

403
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,752
Hey, what are you...

404
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:08,151
Hide inside the rickshaw!

405
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,652
What happened?

406
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,451
Are you okay, Ran?

407
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,452
Yeah.

408
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:18,351
-Is Komakichi Kurataya trying to kill... -Looks like he ran.

409
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,552
Pops?

410
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:47,351
"Next Episode" -With a gun? Are you all right?

411
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:50,052
Komakichi Kurataya...

412
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,451
What's wrong, Asuka?

413
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:55,751
"Kogoro Mouri, In Call" -Answer me, Asuka!

414
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:57,151
Asuka!

415
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:58,951
He has a gun.

416
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:00,952
Whatever you do, don't follow me.

417
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:08,651
Next Conan,

418
