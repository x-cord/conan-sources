1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:06,586
On the way home from reporting on a case, the old man met a man suffering from memory loss.

2
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,546
His name was Esaka Ritsuo.

3
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:15,985
He lost his memories a year earlier and was living as Koneru Taro,

4
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:22,196
but when he fell down the stairs at a train station, he forgot the life he lived as Koneru Taro.

5
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:29,466
Instead, he remembered bits of his memories as Esaka Ritsuo, but...

6
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,236
Esaka-san?

7
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:37,136
Judging by the circumstances, it was almost certainly a suicide.

8
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,116
Suicide?

9
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,805
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

10
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:55,426
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

11
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:59,265
When the door to his lost memories opens, what truth will he see beyond it?

12
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,725
Always determining the one truth

13
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,435
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

14
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,036
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,686
"The Blank Year, Part Two!"

16
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,746
You're sure it was a suicide?

17
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:48,016
Yeah.

18
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:49,285
Takagi-kun.

19
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,325
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:55,295
This apartment, in which he drank the poisoned coffee, was locked.

21
00:02:55,296 --> 00:03:00,846
Both of the keys he received from the landlord were inside the room. And...

22
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:06,606
What we believe is a suicide note was left on that computer.

23
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:13,916
Did he recall a mistake he made in the past when his lost memories returned?

24
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:19,995
Ideally we'll learn something from this, which was left on the table.

25
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:23,076
The new phone he just bought to replace his lost phone?

26
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:26,826
Its history showed two calls made yesterday.

27
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:31,055
The first call was made to the Hida Industries construction company.

28
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:34,086
That's the company he worked at this past year.

29
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,585
That must Hida-san's company.

30
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:40,466
The other call was made to a weather information service.

31
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:43,795
What? A weather information service?

32
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:47,436
Apparently he called to ask a question.

33
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,476
He wanted to know if six months ago around June 10th

34
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:53,765
if any lightning strikes were reported outside the city in Wakabadai.

35
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:59,206
The person answering the phone responded that there were on the evening of the 10th.

36
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:04,725
He called Hida Industries to confirm what site he worked

37
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:08,215
at six months ago on June 10th.

38
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:13,746
The manager Hida examined the records and responded that he was at Wakabadai.

39
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:19,176
Both answers point to Wakabadai on June 10th.

40
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:20,506
Huh?

41
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:22,426
Isn't this...?

42
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,926
It's the day this incident occurred.

43
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:29,436
On that day, Esaka-kun went to Wakabadai, where the crime took place.

44
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:34,566
If he's guilty of something that happened six months ago, in the case of Kisugi Akira's murder...

45
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:35,566
He's...

46
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:36,986
The culprit?

47
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,986
In other words, on that day Esaka Ritsuo...

48
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:52,785
He was working in Wakabadai, and for some reason,

49
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:56,345
he murdered Kisugi Akira and buried the body in the nearby mountains.

50
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:59,245
He'd forgotten that he'd done that.

51
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,755
But the thunder made him remember.

52
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,136
Also, he mentioned something.

53
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:08,376
I felt like I remembered a scene of particular interest to me.

54
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:13,646
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

55
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,485
We still don't know the significance of the dog, though.

56
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,716
He remembered something, but still had doubts, so he called to ask.

57
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,656
And then, feeling remorseful about killing a person...

58
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,586
That explanation does fit, but...

59
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,515
You said the room was locked.

60
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,335
Was the door chain on the front door locked, too?

61
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:46,415
No, the chain wasn't locked,

62
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,096
but both keys were here.

63
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:53,476
One in the back of the desk drawer, and one in that jacket pocket.

64
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,896
Hey, listen...

65
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,765
Shall I tell the Kisugi murder investigation HQ about Esaka?

66
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:04,795
It's still only a possibility.

67
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:09,156
Kisugi Akira was a con artist. It's possible he was one of his victims.

68
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,326
Let's review the information we have.

69
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:16,666
Hey, listen.

70
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:21,296
Remember the scene of interest Esaka-san mentioned?

71
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:25,855
Maybe Esaka-san saw something at Wakabadai that day,

72
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:30,926
like Kisugi Akira and the culprit fighting.

73
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,166
Huh?

74
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:36,615
That would also explain the attempt on his life.

75
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,476
That was just—

76
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,976
Remember what Hida-san and the others said?

77
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:44,225
You're probably imagining that someone tried to kill you.

78
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:45,736
I can only assume that's the case.

79
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,315
But what if it were true

80
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:52,866
and the culprit was trying to silence Esaka-san, the inconvenient witness?

81
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,156
What?

82
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:59,036
Their attempts hadn't worked until now, but they succeeded yesterday.

83
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:05,676
After all, there was someone here when Esaka-san drank the poisoned coffee.

84
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:08,546
What?

85
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,306
Only one of the cups is placed differently on the shelf.

86
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,096
Y-You're right.

87
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,976
Which means...

88
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,226
The culprit probably put it there.

89
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,195
Esaka-san didn't kill himself.

90
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:35,656
He was murdered for his silence and framed as the culprit.

91
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,945
Then the culprit fled.

92
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:41,786
They must've used some kind of trick to lock the room, or else...

93
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:51,926
If Esaka-san let them into his home, then maybe he knew the culprit.

94
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,535
But we need clues.

95
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:57,865
If Esaka-kun saw the culprit six months ago,

96
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:01,316
then there might be someone who saw that.

97
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:06,506
I'd like to ask you about this man in the middle.

98
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,965
He came to the construction site down the road six months ago.

99
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,215
Oh, I remember him.

100
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,196
Did you see something?

101
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,456
He was frantically fleeing from a dog.

102
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:18,826
A dog?

103
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:23,246
He came screaming and running and jumped right up on that utility pole.

104
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,666
I'm sorry!

105
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:36,766
Huh?

106
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,815
Dogs and thunder...

107
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,155
It happened then, right here.

108
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,106
He saw something off in that direction, right?

109
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:50,486
I didn't see anything.

110
00:08:55,716 --> 00:09:00,206
They passed by on that side street then.

111
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,305
They either came from this direction where Kisugi Akira's residence is located,

112
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,516
or this direction from the temple.

113
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:20,726
In any case, Kisugi Akira and the culprit must've passed through here while fighting.

114
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:24,195
And because Esaka-kun witnessed that...

115
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,726
Exactly who is the culprit?

116
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,415
Since the body they buried was discovered,

117
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,525
the culprit attempted to silence Esaka-san in a hurry.

118
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:37,736
But why didn't they do it right away?

119
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:42,866
Come to think of it, he was nearly killed three days after the body was discovered.

120
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:47,326
That's it. They couldn't kill him because they didn't know where he was.

121
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:52,676
But because Esaka-san visited them three days later, they made an attempt on his life.

122
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:57,115
Which means the culprit lives in Koneru.

123
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,185
That would explain it.

124
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,686
You knew that from that start, didn't you?

125
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,475
Residents of Koneru?

126
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:09,736
Yes, among the list of suspects.

127
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:14,675
There must be residents of Koneru who were conned

128
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,236
by Kisugi Akira and had a grudge against him.

129
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,645
No, not a single one.

130
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:20,496
No?

131
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:28,435
But why?

132
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,086
There must be someone.

133
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,836
If they haven't found anyone, then we'll just have to do it ourselves.

134
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,336
There's not much point in searching randomly.

135
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,346
You're not wrong.

136
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:41,476
Maybe the neighborhood steward knows something.

137
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,476
You mean Kinbara-san.

138
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,215
I'm excited to watch it grow.

139
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,686
In a few years, we'll be able to view flowers from within our own home.

140
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,326
A flower viewing in this yard...

141
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:02,036
I'm sure that'll be beautiful.

142
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,056
You'll be better by then, too.

143
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,466
Mori-san?

144
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:18,086
Kinbara Takuzo & Tae

145
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,466
Taro-kun is dead?

146
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:26,096
I'm sure she'll find out sooner or later, but I didn't want your frail wife to hear about it.

147
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:29,476
It's possible he was killed for his silence.

148
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,275
But why?

149
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:38,526
A man was murdered in the mountains of Wakabadai.

150
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:45,315
There should be victims of Kisugi Akira here in Koneru who were conned by him.

151
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,955
Have you heard anything?

152
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,216
I haven't heard anything like that.

153
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,796
They killed Taro-kun?

154
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:59,406
Anyway, could we ask the others about it, too?

155
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,325
What?

156
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,926
Taro-kun was killed?

157
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:09,806
Yes. I wanted to ask if there's anything you can recall about him.

158
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:12,915
Recall about him?

159
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,725
Not off the top of my head.

160
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:17,186
I can't think of anything.

161
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:21,896
But if it's for Taro-san, we'll do what we can to help.

162
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,905
Whoa, whoa.

163
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:27,185
We're not police or private investigators.

164
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,345
Yeah, but...

165
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:32,336
I know. Mori-san can teach us.

166
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,355
Please.

167
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:37,306
All right. Let's do what we can for Taro-kun.

168
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:40,025
I'd feel bad for Taro-san if we left things like this.

169
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,216
We'll do our best.

170
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:42,766
Guys...

171
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:49,226
We'll begin by searching anywhere you find even a little suspicious.

172
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:54,726
We'll find some trace of the culprit who killed Esaka-san.

173
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,896
A bicycle parking lot?

174
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,796
The day before yesterday?

175
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,445
It was around 1PM.

176
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:22,925
Did you see anyone running away from that traffic light?

177
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,435
There's no point in asking me.

178
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,335
I was out sick with a cold.

179
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,426
So you weren't here the day before yesterday.

180
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:33,556
I think Umino-san or Kinbara-san was here instead.

181
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:38,566
Oh, right. Kinbara-san is a bicycle attendant, too.

182
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,435
It must've been Umino-san or Kinbara-san.

183
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,816
Let's see. On that day...

184
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:48,266
Actually, I wanted to ask you about something else.

185
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:55,955
Is there anyone named Doigaki-san among Kisugi Akira's con victims?

186
00:13:55,956 --> 00:14:02,586
Yakitori Izakaya

187
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,466
There should be one at a hardware store.

188
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:12,726
They do have one.

189
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,375
No clues, huh?

190
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,355
Probably because we're regular people.

191
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:22,005
Being a detective is hard work.

192
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,736
Hey, Hida-san.

193
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:25,296
What is it?

194
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:29,156
Yeah, I talked to him. What about it?

195
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:33,036
I don't know, but Kogoro-no-ojisan wanted me to check with you.

196
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:36,286
Why can't we find anything?

197
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,296
Mister, apparently you were right.

198
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:40,556
About what?

199
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,876
By the way, did you all find anything?

200
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,786
Find-diddly-ind anything?

201
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:52,596
Is this...

202
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:53,936
The rumored...

203
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,846
Sleeping Kogoro?

204
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:58,236
First, I must apologize to all of you.

205
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:03,236
We never would've found the culprit following the course I set you on

206
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:09,235
because it wasn't the culprit themselves who was a victim of Kisugi Akira's con artistry.

207
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:10,466
What?

208
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,595
By the way, on June 10th, when Kisugi Akira was murdered,

209
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:21,766
one of you was at Wakabadai where the crime took place

210
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:26,736
in order to attend the second anniversary ceremony of Doigaki Katsuhiro-san's death.

211
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:29,046
Doigaki?

212
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,056
Who's that?

213
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:35,556
He's your wife's younger brother, isn't he, Kinbara Takuzo-san?

214
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:43,526
A bicycle parking lot employee remembered.

215
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,365
Let's see. On that day...

216
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:50,015
Kinbara-san took June 10th off, right?

217
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,505
I remember now.

218
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,536
Kinbara-san said a memorial service for his wife's brother

219
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,935
was being held at a temple in Wakabadai.

220
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:03,666
He worried himself to death after an evil man tricked him out of all of his savings.

221
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:08,045
It was a total coincidence that your wife's family temple

222
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:12,536
was located in Wakabadai where Kisugi Akira lived.

223
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,556
That's where you ran into him.

224
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,186
Kisugi Akira (38) Serial Con Artist

225
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,385
I forgot something.

226
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,145
Wait for me at the temple tea house.

227
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,166
Okay.

228
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:39,076
You demanded that he apologize, and you were seen by...

229
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,076
Huh?

230
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:42,786
Taro-kun?

231
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,656
As long as the body wasn't discovered,

232
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:08,276
you didn't need to worry that Esaka-kun saw you fighting.

233
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:14,685
When Esaka-kun vanished suddenly from Koneru six months later,

234
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,486
I'm sure you were secretly relieved.

235
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:21,996
But the body you buried was discovered, and three days later,

236
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:27,576
you saw Esaka-kun, who you thought had disappeared from the neighborhood.

237
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:35,396
Believing he'd come to ask you about Kisugi Akira's death...

238
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,816
What happened?

239
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:47,335
While I was waiting for the light to change, someone suddenly pushed my back.

240
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,096
I was nearly hit by a car.

241
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:52,236
You planned to silence him.

242
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:56,736
Your amnesia's been cured, and instead...

243
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:59,996
You lost your memories of the past year.

244
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:04,506
And though you learned Esaka-kun had lost his memories of the past year...

245
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,876
I felt like I remembered a scene of particular interest to me.

246
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,756
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

247
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,386
You realized he was dangerous.

248
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:21,766
When you heard from Hida-san that he was asking weird questions,

249
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:25,836
you believed Esaka-kun was remembering what happened and panicked.

250
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,896
I did tell him about the phone call, but...

251
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:36,006
That's when you came up with the idea of framing him for Kisugi Akira's murder.

252
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,656
Last night you visited Esaka-kun.

253
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,546
You poisoned him and made it look like a suicide,

254
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,336
and used a spare key to lock his apartment.

255
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:55,256
That key convinced me that you did it.

256
00:18:55,796 --> 00:19:00,766
I believed that if you had a spare key, you must've made it.

257
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:08,335
I'm going to pop home for a minute.

258
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:11,645
I'm worried if she's remembered to take her medicine.

259
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:16,946
When I checked with the nearby hardware store, you had indeed made a spare key then.

260
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:26,845
Apparently a single hair was stuck to Kisugi Akira's body.

261
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:29,115
It wasn't his.

262
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:33,836
The culprit's hair must've gotten stuck to the body when they fought just prior to his murder.

263
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:39,096
I'm sure a comparison would make it clear whose it is.

264
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:52,345
Today, when you said it was possible that Taro-kun had been killed for his silence,

265
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,856
I knew it was over.

266
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,736
Everything you've said is correct, Mori-san.

267
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,355
Have you remembered that scene that was bothering you?

268
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:06,366
A dog barked at me, and then lightning struck.

269
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:10,996
I feel like I saw this man then, too.

270
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:15,005
Could I have some sugar?

271
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,506
Oh, sorry.

272
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:24,515
This man was fighting with someone.

273
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,766
Someone I know well.

274
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,766
So you do remember.

275
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:43,786
I doubt you'd be willing to let this slide, but there's something I want to tell you.

276
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:48,536
Tell me what?

277
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:52,286
By the way...

278
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,806
I'm sorry for what I did to Taro-kun.

279
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,936
Then, why did you do it?

280
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:24,446
I was afraid of being arrested.

281
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:30,536
Not of being arrested and punished.

282
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:33,626
I was afraid of...

283
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:39,086
Leaving your frail wife alone.

284
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:19,436
I'll look after your wife until you're back.

285
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:34,296
Huh?

286
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,656
What's the last thing I remember?

287
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,296
Don't worry about it.

288
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:53,306
Hello. I'm Kasuga-sensei's apprentice Komiyama Yoshio.

289
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,056
There they are.

290
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:04,236
I was scouted to model for them around here, too.

291
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,896
That better be true.

292
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:09,156
It definitely is.

293
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,726
The next episode of Conan is "Mori Ran, the Model!"
