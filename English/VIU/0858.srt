1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:02,707
Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who was thought to be a nuisance

2
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:05,307
by the entire neighborhood is killed.

3
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:06,907
Mr. Hikoichi Bando, the head of the community,

4
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:11,007
who was thought to be a suspect for the murder was also killed.

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,907
Through the testimony of Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu,

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:15,107
the owner of a coffee shop nearby

7
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,907
and the deductions of both Officer Takagi and Chiba,

8
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:21,908
Mr. Chino arose as a suspect, however...

9
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:25,207
Inspector, it bothered you too, didn't it?

10
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,907
That a mystery expert

11
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:29,107
would put poison inside the bottle instead of the cup

12
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,007
or make such careless mistakes

13
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:34,307
like keeping the door unlocked, right?

14
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,707
Which means that Mr. Chino is not the real perp X.

15
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,007
But, there's a possibility that he was just framed.

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,107
What? Back then...

17
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,607
The customers here were...

18
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,208
If I remember correctly...

19
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:52,307
Oh, Mr. Fukuda and his family

20
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:55,008
and Ms. Hiro Ezaki were here with her friends.

21
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:58,707
The one who first discovered Mr. Amagi's corpse

22
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:02,307
and the lady who was pushing Mr. Bando to do his thing were also here.

23
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,808
If so, the real perp X is...

24
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,607
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

25
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:23,007
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

26
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,107
Who is trying to kill who?

27
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:27,307
An unexpected perp is found in an unexpected place.

28
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:28,907
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,107
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:33,608
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:08,044
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 2)"

32
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,615
About Mr. Chino?

33
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:15,515
It seems he used to act as judge for the new writer's award sometimes.

34
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:17,115
For mysteries, right?

35
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:19,515
He seems to be in the middle of judging right now too.

36
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:22,815
He said so at the shop yesterday, right?

37
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,315
Yes. It seems to be tough work, though!

38
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,815
"Yosuke Chino (35), College Professor" -I can't focus unless it's night

39
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:31,815
so I'm confining myself to my study all night again tonight.

40
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:36,415
X who probably heard this decided to commit the crime at night.

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,815
But, why are you asking me that?

42
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:42,216
I don't know, because Pops Kogoro just told me to ask you.

43
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:45,315
Those two could've committed the crime.

44
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:47,315
Although the motive is still unknown,

45
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:50,816
it's highly likely that Mr. Fukuda or Ms. Ezaki is X.

46
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:54,216
I've got to confirm their alibis for last night.

47
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:57,715
I'll start with the one who was the first to discover the corpse.

48
00:03:57,716 --> 00:03:59,315
He got what he deserved.

49
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:02,015
The heavens punished him.

50
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:04,516
Mr. Tameo Fukuda.

51
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:07,715
If I killed the person called Amagi

52
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,715
and tried to make it look as if Bando did it,

53
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,615
I would never use an awl!

54
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:17,215
Because I knew that Bando had a fear of sharp objects

55
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,616
and couldn't use an awl!

56
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:25,015
That was because...

57
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,115
He deliberately!

58
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,615
When everything was exposed,

59
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:33,615
he was thinking of getting away by saying that

60
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:36,915
he would never use an awl because he knew Mr. Bando

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,715
had a fear of needles!

62
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:43,715
Exactly like you just said, Mr. Chino.

63
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,915
I see, you tried to outwit us.

64
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,215
If you keep trying to think how I outwitted you,

65
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,016
this can go on forever.

66
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,915
Don't you think we're on the ball this time?

67
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,315
Yeah, it scares me too.

68
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,616
I can't stop making deductions.

69
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,415
Hey, manager.

70
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,515
Does Mr. Fukuda work only night shifts?

71
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,016
Yeah.

72
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,815
It would be difficult for him to commit the crime.

73
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,015
So, it must be the other one then.

74
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,315
That unreliable useless guy

75
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:16,715
finally was of some use to the community.

76
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,015
To stab a nuisance who was hated by everyone,

77
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,715
how convenient can things get.

78
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:25,115
Ms. Hiro Ezaki who was pressuring

79
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:29,015
the head of the community, Mr. Bando the most.

80
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,615
"Ezaki" -Really?

81
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:35,315
Ms. Hiro Ezaki is a student of Haido University?

82
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:37,415
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,715
Mr. Chino teaches at Haido University.

84
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,615
The two have a point of contact.

85
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,415
Ms. Ezaki got into trouble with Mr. Chino at the university

86
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,716
-and because of this, she... -Hey!

87
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:50,515
Why are you investigating me?

88
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,415
What are you snooping around me for?

89
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,715
-Bye! -Hey!

90
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:58,216
Wait, brat!

91
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:06,816
I wonder if there's something she doesn't want me to find out.

92
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:14,315
What are you going to do with that?

93
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,515
I'm taking it home.

94
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:19,215
But you just brought it with you this morning.

95
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:21,715
I'm done with it, you see.

96
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,115
You're done?

97
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,415
I'll go take it home, because there are no customers right now either.

98
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,015
It's precious to me, you see.

99
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,416
See you later.

100
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,615
Precious?

101
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,315
But they're not the latest edition

102
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,915
and she's only got one each.

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,615
Maybe she buys it only when the writer she favors is in it.

104
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:53,015
Who is it? The writer that Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu likes?

105
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,715
If I remember correctly, that "World of Deduction"

106
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,515
was last year's May edition.

107
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,115
I don't think there was anything that stood out.

108
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,216
"Labyrinth" was this year's January edition.

109
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,015
What? This writer...

110
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,915
I also saw this writer in the "World of Deduction" too.

111
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,115
"The Melting Weapon" -No mistake about it.

112
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:12,815
It's Yamiyo Dorosue.

113
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:16,315
It's the same writer of the books that were on the bookshelf.

114
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,515
Hello?

115
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:20,415
Yes, this is Detective Mouri.

116
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,115
I'd like to ask you an odd question.

117
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,515
"Monthly Magazine Labyrinths, Magazine Search"

118
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:28,515
It's a story that's hard to understand, isn't it?

119
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,615
The trick is insane,

120
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,415
and their criminal profile is totally unrealistic.

121
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,215
"Zetto Ichimura (32), Editor" -They hate arguments so much,

122
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:39,315
they casually commit murders one after another to avoid them.

123
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:42,415
There's nobody who could do something like that.

124
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,415
If such a person were actually around, it would really be scary.

125
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,815
"This is terrible! Chiba New Writer Award Submission"

126
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,515
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you.

127
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,715
Do you remember hearing the name Yamiyo Dorosue?

128
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:54,816
Yamiyo Dorosue?

129
00:07:56,116 --> 00:08:00,615
The one who wrote "The Melting Weapon", that ridiculous story.

130
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,715
So, you remembered after all.

131
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:07,815
Pops was saying this case doesn't end with ABC

132
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:13,316
but is an ABCD case that involves that Yamiyo Dorosue.

133
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:17,816
Mr. Chino, do you remember anything about that story?

134
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,915
I knew it.

135
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,316
It's all coming together now.

136
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,915
Really? You like mysteries too?

137
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,015
Yes. So, I thought that I'd like to

138
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,815
think over the mystery of this case with you.

139
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,215
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?

140
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,316
Okay, let's go.

141
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:47,115
But, Conan, was that your name?

142
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,215
Don't you think it's a bit too late?

143
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:52,415
The perp is Mr. Chino, right?

144
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:56,015
No, I think that there's a real perp X

145
00:08:56,016 --> 00:09:00,216
and that Mr. Chino was also framed by X.

146
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:04,015
But I wonder if that'll be enough.

147
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:07,815
X killed Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando

148
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:11,815
so isn't it unnatural that only Mr. Chino is left unkilled?

149
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,715
I think perp X deliberately didn't kill him.

150
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,215
Which means?

151
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:20,115
X really had a grudge against Mr. Chino.

152
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:23,515
That's why X didn't want to kill him easily

153
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:25,815
like Mr. Amagi or Mr. Bando.

154
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,715
X wanted him to suffer so badly that even dying would be better.

155
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:32,715
Mean to get him arrested despite being innocent?

156
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,415
Right. If you think of it that way,

157
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,715
it's understandable why Mr. Chino was left deliberately unkilled.

158
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:41,915
I see, what you're saying makes sense, Conan.

159
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,015
Then, now it's my turn.

160
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:48,215
Who is that X? I think there are two points.

161
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:52,415
Yes, because X tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the perp.

162
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,815
A person who knew that Mr. Chino

163
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,815
wouldn't have anyone to confirm his alibi.

164
00:09:56,816 --> 00:10:02,015
And a person who could have stolen his lighter.

165
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,615
That's right.

166
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,015
Oh, I'm in a fix!

167
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,815
If so, the suspicious people would be

168
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,215
among those who had come to my shop yesterday as customers.

169
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:16,615
I asked Koyuki who the customers that came yesterday were,

170
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,915
and the most suspicious among them was Mr. Fukuda.

171
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,715
Mr. Fukuda was upset at being troubled by Mr. Amagi

172
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:26,315
and I wonder if he also held a grudge against Mr. Bando

173
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:30,015
despite being the community head for doing nothing.

174
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:32,115
That's enough motive.

175
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:35,915
But, Mr. Fukuda couldn't have committed the crime at night.

176
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,115
I guess so. Because Mr. Fukuda works the night shift.

177
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:44,215
Yeah. Then the next suspicious person is...

178
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:46,415
Ms. Hiro Ezaki?

179
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,815
She seems to be a student at Haido University,

180
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,116
so it could be that she got into some kind of trouble with Mr. Chino.

181
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,515
But we can't conclude that it's her either.

182
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:59,115
But if Mr. Fukuda couldn't have done it...

183
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,816
We can't narrow it down to Mr. Fukuda and Ms. Ezaki to begin with, right?

184
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:09,915
Mr. Fukuda's wife and Ms. Hiro Ezaki's friend could also have done it?

185
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,515
It's possible.

186
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:15,215
It also doesn't have to be limited to the customers either.

187
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,015
Don't tell me you're referring to Koyuki?

188
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,615
I see.

189
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:22,815
That's thinkable too.

190
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:27,315
But the real identity of the perp who killed Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando

191
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:33,016
and further tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the killer is...

192
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,875
The identity of the real perp X is...

193
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,576
Maybe...

194
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,875
Oh, my.

195
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,975
Aren't you the owner of the coffee shop?

196
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,875
My, Ms. Ezaki.

197
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,375
I was just about to go to the shop, is it open?

198
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,575
Yes, Koyuki is watching the shop for me.

199
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:58,575
My, but he...

200
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:03,275
Oh, no. Don't tell Ruriko about this, owner!

201
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:05,775
Hey, is everything okay?

202
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,975
It's fine. She's not a blabber mouth.

203
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:10,476
Come on, let's go.

204
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:14,475
I don't think she has anything to do with the case.

205
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:17,675
It seems she has a secret she doesn't want anyone to know about.

206
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,975
Now that we know Ms. Ezaki is innocent,

207
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,975
I guess the identity of perp X has been narrowed down.

208
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:27,375
Perp X after killing Mr. Tatsuya Amagi and Mr. Bando

209
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:31,775
is trying to frame Mr. Chino for the murders.

210
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:34,075
But, in order to frame Mr. Chino up as the perp,

211
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,475
a fundamental problem existed.

212
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,875
Why? Because to begin with,

213
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:43,075
Mr. Chino had no motive to have to kill Mr. Amagi or Bando.

214
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:47,475
Without a motive, you can't frame Mr. Chino up as the perp.

215
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:54,075
But, then X found out that Mr. Chino searched Mr. Bando's storeroom.

216
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,575
X figured this could be used to his advantage.

217
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,675
Moreover, the other day...

218
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:01,075
I can't focus unless it's night

219
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:04,476
so I'm confining myself to my study all night again tonight.

220
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,475
When Mr. Chino was off guard, X switched his lighter

221
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:10,575
for a similar looking one and got a hold of it.

222
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:13,375
X carried the plan out on the day

223
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,276
that Mr. Chino would have no one to verify his alibi.

224
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:20,176
First, X called Mr. Amagi out to the park at night.

225
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,776
Who are you?

226
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,676
And murdered him.

227
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,376
And then...

228
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,175
killed Mr. Bando

229
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:03,175
X put the bottle of liquor with pesticide in,

230
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,875
and near the glass, a bottle of pesticide and the awl on the table.

231
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:10,675
Then leaving Mr. Chino's lighter that X got in the afternoon behind,

232
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:13,375
X gets a hold of Mr. Bando's hospital card

233
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:16,776
and drops it near the corpse of Mr. Amagi.

234
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:21,276
All X had left to do was to wait for Mr. Amagi's body to be found.

235
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:25,675
The police would naturally suspect Mr. Bando when they found his card.

236
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:29,475
But I don't think so.

237
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:33,475
Mr. Bando's not the type that can cause such an incident.

238
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:37,075
Then X appears as a kind source of information.

239
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,775
That lighter...

240
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:42,375
-Remember? -Oh! It's Mr. Chino's!

241
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,975
X turns everyone's attention towards Mr. Chino.

242
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:47,175
What a disgusting off the point pair.

243
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,975
What? Off the point?

244
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,375
X provokes the police detectives

245
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:55,075
and just as written in the scenario...

246
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:58,075
-That's it! -That's what it was!

247
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,075
X leads them along very cleverly.

248
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:03,375
Making it sound like there were precious treasures in Mr. Bando's storeroom

249
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:08,175
and that Mr. Chino killed the two men in order to steal the treasures.

250
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:09,875
In other words, does it mean

251
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,775
that X couldn't forgive Mr. Amagi who was a nuisance to the community

252
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:17,375
as well as the lazy Mr. Bando despite being the head of the community?

253
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,675
Even though the two may have had faults,

254
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:22,975
killing them is a fact that cannot be forgiven.

255
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:26,575
I think you deduction works, Conan,

256
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:30,675
but even if it is true, the mystery is not yet solved.

257
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,175
Why does X have a grudge against Mr. Chino?

258
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:38,875
X left behind the hint to solving that mystery.

259
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,175
The iron rule of solving a mystery is

260
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:43,975
to hand over all the hints to solving the mystery

261
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,475
without hiding anything.

262
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:50,475
That's why X took us to the coffee shop.

263
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:53,975
Then X showed us the books that was the key necessary for us

264
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,975
to solve the mystery.

265
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,475
It was a magazine specializing in mystery

266
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:01,375
that X went out of her way to bring over from her residence.

267
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:06,575
Right, in that book, there was a hint to solve the mystery.

268
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:09,275
What was the hint?

269
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:11,376
Yamiyo Dorosue.

270
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:18,375
The name of this writer was on all the books that X showed us.

271
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,175
Unfortunately, it seemed that the police did not realize

272
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:24,275
the hint that X had left behind though.

273
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,775
I almost overlooked it too.

274
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:32,475
All of Yamiyo Dorosue's writings have failed to pass the screening.

275
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:35,975
I was concerned so I contacted the publisher and confirmed.

276
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:39,675
Then I found another common point.

277
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:43,376
The one who judging all the manuscripts for the new writer's award was...

278
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,875
Yosuke Chino.

279
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:49,976
Right.

280
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:55,076
The real perp X of this case...

281
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:59,075
had a grudge against Mr. Chino

282
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:02,076
and wanted to make a killer out of him.

283
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:06,076
Yamiyo Dorosue.

284
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:10,075
So I confirmed everything with Mr. Chino in person

285
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,275
and figured everything out.

286
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:15,075
After killing Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando,

287
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,976
she tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the killer.

288
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,076
Yamiyo Dorosue is...

289
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,576
Toyoko Kanemitsu.

290
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,376
It's you, correct?

291
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,875
Mr. Chino said that your writing...

292
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:48,075
Yes, right before my eyes.

293
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:49,175
Come to think of it,

294
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:52,475
one of the works I'm reviewing right now is incredible.

295
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:56,075
It's called "The Melting Weapon", and this is really horrors.

296
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,775
Is it that bad?

297
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,375
Well, everything about it is terrible.

298
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,175
Listen to this too, owner.

299
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,875
He criticized your piece.

300
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,375
And...

301
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,775
The contents of the mystery was terrible

302
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:11,875
but the name Yamiyo Dorosue is the pits too.

303
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:15,976
I doubt the character of anybody who can write something like that.

304
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:22,675
He not only laughed off my character, he also denied my entire being.

305
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:23,776
That's why...

306
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:29,376
I killed Amagi who was a pain to this town...

307
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:35,375
and killed useless Bando as well.

308
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:39,975
So that I could frame Chino up for the murders!

309
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:43,475
I didn't have much of a grudge against the two.

310
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:47,075
I killed them because it was just the thing to frame Chino for the murders

311
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:50,075
that I wrote as a plot in my mystery manuscript.

312
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:53,875
But Conan...

313
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:58,075
Thank you so much for solving the mystery.

314
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:01,475
But I have no evidence, everything I said is based only on my deduction.

315
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,875
Oh, come on. So as long as the mystery is solved,

316
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,875
there's no need for unrefined elements like evidence,

317
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:11,175
in pure mystery.

318
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,675
The ABC murder case that you referred to

319
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,775
was also a hint, wasn't it?

320
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:22,175
Agatha Christie's story not only A, B, C, but also D.

321
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:27,075
In other words, the hint to this case was to think it out including the D.

322
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,576
You genuinely like mysteries, don't you?

323
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,376
But you've taken things a bit too far.

324
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:45,176
You turned the mystery that you thought up into a murder weapon.

325
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,575
No matter how much you like mysteries,

326
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:50,675
no matter how good the mystery is,

327
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:53,875
you can't cross the final line.

328
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:58,275
As is basic to mysteries, you displayed the hints, but that's...

329
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:02,075
It was my nature and sin.

330
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,576
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,675
What do you want, brat? Why'd you tell me to come here?

332
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,375
She wants you to escort her, Pops.

333
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:19,375
What? Where to?

334
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:22,175
I really hate evidence,

335
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,475
but I figured the police may want it,

336
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,575
so I got it ready.

337
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:29,075
She has the receipt from the DIY shop.

338
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:33,375
The one for the time I bought the awl that I used on Mr. Amagi

339
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:37,676
and the pesticide I bought and used on Mr. Bando.

340
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,875
What? You...

341
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:44,076
You know where you're going, don't you?

342
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,675
What?

343
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:50,375
Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu killed the two.

344
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,675
And tried to frame Mr. Chino?

345
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:57,376
And all because she held a grudge against him for laughing at her story?

346
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:04,275
I really don't want to shower the elderly with harsh words,

347
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,975
but to take someone's life is...

348
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,975
I know what I did was unforgivable.

349
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,576
That's why I'm here.

350
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:42,075
And, what's the content of "The Melting Weapon" all about?

351
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:45,875
Well, it's about a locked room murder.

352
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,875
The bedroom door is locked from the inside,

353
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:51,575
but the perp sends a slug smeared with poison

354
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,975
through the space between the door.

355
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:58,675
The moment the victim who is sleeping inside touches the poisoned slug,

356
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:02,875
the poison penetrates the victim's skin, and they suffers and dies.

357
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,275
On the other hand, the slug which is the murder weapon

358
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:08,975
because of the salt content in the victim's perspiration

359
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,675
melts and vanishes.

360
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,675
The locked room murder is completed.

361
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:18,575
But, why does that slug so conveniently go crawling over to the victim?

362
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:23,075
And why doesn't the slug die despite being smeared with poison?

363
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:26,475
Unfortunately, those things are not explained.

364
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,975
What? Give me a break.

365
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,075
That's too much of a mystery for me.

366
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,075
But if you think of it as some space to think on your own,

367
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:35,475
it's amusing.

368
00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:37,475
How would you explain it, Pops?

369
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:40,276
Some space...

370
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:44,475
"Mount Kumomaru, Cottage Entrance" -Enough!

371
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:45,675
What?

372
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:49,876
Yeah. I put kerosene on to strengthen it.

373
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,676
I had a nightmare.

374
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,875
Will you tell us a little

375
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,576
about the late Ms. Yamakura then?

376
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:12,376
Next Conan, "The Dark Mountain Route"
