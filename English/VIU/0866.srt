1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,019
Sorry, Furuya.

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,119
They found out that I'm a secret police agent.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
My only escape is...

4
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:22,319
to the underworld.

5
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,019
See you.

6
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,819
Zero.

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,519
Traitors...

8
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,519
shall be punished.

9
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,719
Right?

10
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,819
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

11
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,019
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

12
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,419
The truth behind Akai and Scotch's relationship.

13
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:20,519
The drama surrounding the Organization continues.

14
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,219
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,419
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,819
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:55,226 --> 00:03:00,926
"The Traitor's Stage (Part 1)"

18
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:07,517
Bourbon?

19
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,033
Hey, Bourbon!

20
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,033
What?

21
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,633
What you mean?

22
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:17,333
You were supposed to turn right at that intersection.

23
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,333
I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.

24
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,733
My, it's so unlike you.

25
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:27,133
Which means you weren't listening to me?

26
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,233
I was.

27
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:32,233
Before it goes public,

28
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,433
all I have to do is crush it, correct?

29
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,433
The guy's a big shot.

30
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,833
If you find it hard to get close,

31
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,633
I can disguise you as one of his people.

32
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,733
No need to worry.

33
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,033
I've got an idea of how to get close to him.

34
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,133
Gosh.

35
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,033
Why of all things does a sweet high school girl

36
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,633
on her way back from school

37
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:04,333
have to help clean up the room of a deduction freak who's not home?

38
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,733
Come on, Sonoko. It's only a once in a while thing.

39
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,433
Sorry.

40
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:17,533
Thank you so much for helping out.

41
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:21,733
This place is too spacious to clean by myself.

42
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,833
It's okay, because I love to clean.

43
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,333
Sonoko.

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,633
By the way, was her name Masumi Sera?

45
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:32,533
She didn't come.

46
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,733
We invited her over.

47
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,633
But she seems to be busy because she has to change hotels again.

48
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,233
I see.

49
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,333
But how nice to be able to live in a hotel.

50
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,733
Really?

51
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,033
Well, for a Ms. Richie like you living in large mansion,

52
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,133
every day is like living in a hotel.

53
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:54,733
Didn't you see any strange people around Ms. Sera?

54
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,933
For example, someone who is constantly on his guard,

55
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,333
and if someone is deemed to be dangerous, he has the power

56
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,433
to bring that person under his control in a matter of seconds.

57
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,233
A person called Asaka...

58
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:06,233
I'm sure that person hasn't come up front, though.

59
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,433
The name's not Asaka, but there is one person!

60
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,733
Was there anybody like that?

61
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,533
That person is you, Ran!

62
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,533
What?

63
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:20,433
Remember, you're my exclusive SP

64
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:24,833
that will take down anyone dangerous that appears before in an instant.

65
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,233
Listen...

66
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,533
Gosh.

67
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:31,833
That's right. Talking of Asaca...

68
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,233
The title of the new song that rock music Rokumichi Hado

69
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,533
is going to release is "ASACA".

70
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:40,233
He finally seems to have made the lyrics for a song

71
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,633
that he composed 17 years ago.

72
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,233
And he's going to sing it at his next live.

73
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,233
17 years ago?

74
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:49,433
But the title is a bit weird, right?

75
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,233
What do you mean by weird?

76
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,933
It was publicized on the internet in alphabet.

77
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:57,833
The title "ASACA" is spelled with a "C"

78
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,633
instead of the usual "K".

79
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,933
"KA" is spelled...

80
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,533
"CA?"

81
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,033
Why? Why is it spelled "CA" instead of "KA"?

82
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:20,333
I wonder.

83
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,633
I'm sure there's a reason!

84
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,233
Can't you come up with something?

85
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,033
If you want to know that badly, why don't you ask him personally?

86
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,033
What?

87
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,533
We're going to watch Rokumichi Hado's rehearsal soon,

88
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,233
so I'll take you there.

89
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,433
Really?

90
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:35,733
If it's okay with you,

91
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:39,933
could I go and watch that rehearsal with you?

92
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,433
You want to go too, Subaru?

93
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:44,033
I'm a great fan of Rokumichi Hado!

94
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,133
Okay! My pleasure!

95
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:50,433
By the way, when was that title announced on the internet?

96
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,033
Just last week.

97
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,833
It's a new song in 5 years, you see.

98
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,133
So it ranked high on the internet news.

99
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,033
Right, right.

100
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,933
If so...

101
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,533
They've...

102
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,233
already...

103
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,433
seen it, too.

104
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,933
What?

105
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,633
We can't watch the rehearsal?

106
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:15,833
No joke?

107
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,633
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:21,433
The fact is, the lyrics for the new song hasn't been completed yet.

109
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:25,533
He wants to write the lyrics on stage with no audience,

110
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,033
so he says he wants to be left alone for two hours.

111
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,833
Do things like this happen often?

112
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,433
Yes, sometimes.

113
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,733
Well, let's just let him have it his way.

114
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:39,133
It seems that this live is going to be the last one for him, too.

115
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,933
Big!

116
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,233
Last?

117
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,633
Was the rumor about Mr. Hado retiring true?

118
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,233
Yes. We tried to stop him many times,

119
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:51,733
but it seems he's going to announce it to his fans at tomorrow's live.

120
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,133
So, did things get settled then?

121
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,833
It's unthinkable that he's resigning while still under contract.

122
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,633
"Hirokazu Kajitani (51), Magazine journalist" -If he insists on resigning,

123
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,433
his company said they would take it to court

124
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,433
and make him pay an exorbitant sum for breach of contract.

125
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,933
What's with you? Where'd you come in from?

126
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,933
Of course, I came in from the front entrance.

127
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,533
I bribed one of the staff

128
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,033
and got hold of this staff jumper, too.

129
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,933
More importantly, Ms. beautiful,

130
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,033
did you settle your side of the problem?

131
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,633
What problem?

132
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,633
There's rumor going around that the title of his new song "ASACA"

133
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:32,633
is actually the name of Hado's new girlfriend.

134
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:36,133
And you, who were his girl for years, got enraged

135
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:39,533
and got into a big fight with Hado telling him not to release the song.

136
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,533
Who on earth's saying that?

137
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,033
I hear that your editor bawled you out

138
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,933
because another magazine company scooped the article

139
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:50,133
on Hado resigning from his music career before you did!

140
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,333
He bawled you out saying,

141
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,333
"what do you think you were glued to Hado for 15 years for"?

142
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,733
That's why I disguised myself as staff and came over.

143
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:04,033
I want to make an explosive comeback before Hado resigns.

144
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,433
You two over there!

145
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,533
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,833
He's not authorized personnel, so kick him out of here!

147
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,233
What?

148
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,333
Hey, I went out of my way to bribe my way in here, you know!

149
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,833
Let me at least have a short interview or something!

150
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,133
-Be quiet. -Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

151
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,333
Let go of me! Hey!

152
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,333
Shall we get going too, then?

153
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,533
I guess so, since we've got school tomorrow, too.

154
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,133
Are we leaving?

155
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,233
I'm sorry. But maybe that's better.

156
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,033
Because we don't know when rehearsal will start.

157
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,033
Yes.

158
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,833
But if this is going to be his last live,

159
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,033
I think it'll be better to watch the rehearsal, no?

160
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,133
I hate to say this to you, Subaru...

161
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,533
But we're not that much a fan of his as you are.

162
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,633
What?

163
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,833
Then, who was the one that wanted to come here?

164
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,733
Me.

165
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,633
I was saying that I'm a great fan of Mr. Hado at Poirot

166
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:02,733
then she made arrangements for me to come and watch his rehearsal.

167
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,833
It seems that Sonoko's family,

168
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,033
the Suzuki Financial group happened to be an investor

169
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:09,833
for the record company that he belongs to.

170
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,033
You're here too, Azusa?

171
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:15,133
You didn't seem interested at Poirot, though.

172
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,933
I hid it at the shop,

173
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,333
but I'm actually a great fan of his, too!

174
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,033
So...

175
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,633
after finishing our shift at the shop,

176
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:26,333
I followed Mr. Amuro here!

177
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,033
I was surprised

178
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:32,433
when she called to me just as I was about to come in here.

179
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,633
Well, I explained to the staff

180
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,433
and had them let us through somehow, though.

181
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:42,233
Talk of being surprised, you came here too,

182
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,433
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

183
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,233
Thank you for the other day.

184
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:49,233
Do you remember me?

185
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,233
Yes. You're...

186
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,433
The courier?

187
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,533
What?

188
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,033
Yes, sort of.

189
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,833
Okay, then you three fans, take your time and enjoy.

190
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,933
Hey, Conan, you're coming home with me.

191
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,333
Wait!

192
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,633
Azusa.

193
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:14,933
You like Mr. Hado because he's a great guitar player, right?

194
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,133
You're really good at playing the guitar too, Azusa.

195
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,433
Yes, of course!

196
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:25,233
I thought you said that you never touched the guitar before?

197
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,833
Remember the other day when we asked you to become one of our band members?

198
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,633
Oh, right. Back then, I was too embarrassed

199
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,633
to become a member of a high school girls band, you see.

200
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,733
So she's...

201
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,133
Vermouth after all!

202
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:45,733
If so, I'd better make Subaru get out of here as soon as possible.

203
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:49,133
Mr. Hado's best song is "Bloody Comet", right?

204
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,333
No, no. I prefer "Fallen Angel of Snow".

205
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,733
They're enjoying chatting together.

206
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,633
Subaru.

207
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:01,033
No good, we've got to get out of here quick.

208
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,833
No pain no gain.

209
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,333
But better bend than break.

210
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,133
We've come for fire inspection.

211
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,633
We're confirming the fire equipment.

212
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,733
-You two. -Wait! Inside...

213
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,653
Mr. Hado's...

214
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,253
Wait, Conan!

215
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:54,753
No, angel!

216
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:59,153
Don't go inside.

217
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,153
This bloody stage is not appropriate for you.

218
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:05,753
Angel?

219
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,953
See! Because you're an angel, Ran.

220
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,353
Angel... A pun?

221
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,653
At any rate, let's leave the investigation up to them.

222
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:21,453
And the one in the Organization

223
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:25,153
who possesses outstanding perceptiveness, Bourbon.

224
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:28,153
Along with the high school detective who turned into a child due to a drug,

225
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:30,753
Shinichi Kudo.

226
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,553
And another...

227
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,653
Who?

228
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,153
Is there more than one perp?

229
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,653
If this was the work of one person,

230
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,753
it had to be somebody with Herculean power.

231
00:13:45,753 --> 00:13:48,553
Don't you think so, Mr. Okiya?

232
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,753
When I met you the other day,

233
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:54,953
you appeared to me as one with outstanding power of deduction.

234
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:56,253
No way.

235
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,553
I'm just any other mystery loving upper grad.

236
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,253
There's a hole in the rope that looks like something twisted into it.

237
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,753
On the sleeve of the stage,

238
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:14,853
there's a folding chair, rope and tool box.

239
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,153
Judging from the cut at the tip of the rope,

240
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,853
it's probably the extra rope after he was hung.

241
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:21,653
But why on earth would it be in a place like this?

242
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,853
Huh?

243
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:26,153
What's this string? Is it a kite string?

244
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:31,953
It's connected all the way to the top of the seats.

245
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,453
What's going on?

246
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,653
On the tip of the kite string...

247
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,553
A baseball?

248
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,253
Tell me about the case.

249
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,453
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,253
The deceased is Mr. Rokumichi Hado, age 39, a musician.

251
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:55,553
It seems he was scheduled to perform a live here tomorrow.

252
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:59,053
I see. And the ETD?

253
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,553
Judging from the dilation of his pupils,

254
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:04,953
I guess it would be between one to two hours ago.

255
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:07,253
According to his manager,

256
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:11,253
it seems that Mr. Hado had confined himself to this hall

257
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,653
to write lyrics from about two hours ago.

258
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,653
Which means that someone entered this hall during that time

259
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:20,953
and hung the victim to death.

260
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,353
Well, I think a rope was passed through that steel pipe

261
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:27,053
that the spotlight is attached to

262
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,953
and he was hung using a device that can move heavy curtains.

263
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,453
I don't think so.

264
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:37,553
The room where the special equipment for moving the curtains was locked.

265
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,053
Moreover, the staff that had the key

266
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:42,953
seems to have been out to dinner.

267
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:46,453
Then, did the perp hang him without using the device?

268
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,753
I think several people did.

269
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:53,253
Unless there is a pulley or something on the bar of the stage,

270
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,253
I think doing it alone is virtually impossible.

271
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:58,953
The other thing that bothers me are the folded chair,

272
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:01,653
extra rope and tool box left at the sleeve of the stage.

273
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:05,253
Also, the queer hole that is left by the knot of the rope

274
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:09,153
that is tied to the seat in the audience to hang the corpse.

275
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:13,053
Furthermore, a baseball with a kite string attached to it

276
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:15,453
was also on the floor partway through the audience seat, too!

277
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:18,553
Conan, you're here too?

278
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:22,653
Let's ask the staff here tell us what they have to say.

279
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,053
But I mean it's amazing

280
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:27,453
how the detectives come one after another pursuing the cases.

281
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,653
True.

282
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,453
Conan has a perfect attendance record, too.

283
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:35,153
Let me summarize the things the staff told me.

284
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,453
Between the hours of 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.,

285
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,453
Mr. Hado's estimated time of death,

286
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:43,553
only the whereabouts of two people, Mr. Fuse and Ms. Enjo,

287
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,053
couldn't be confirmed.

288
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,153
Come on!

289
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:51,553
I told you already, didn't I? I had the runs since this morning

290
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,953
and was sitting on the toilet seat.

291
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:58,553
I was also running around the hall instructing the staff.

292
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,353
Incidentally, the person who first discovered the corpse

293
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,753
was a firefighter who came here for fire inspection.

294
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:06,353
Officer!

295
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:08,953
He's also suspicious too, isn't he?

296
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,453
Hey, let me go!

297
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:12,453
Hado was killed, wasn't he?

298
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:15,953
Yeah.

299
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:20,153
I did buy the jumper from the staff and come into this hall.

300
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:23,353
It was a little before 5:30 p.m., about 5:20.

301
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,553
If you think I'm lying,

302
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:27,353
ask the staff that I bought the jumper from!

303
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,553
If so, it's odd.

304
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:34,353
Because Ms. Enjo was nowhere in sight between 4:30 p.m. to 4:50,

305
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,453
and Mr. Fuse from 5:00 p.m. to about 5:15.

306
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,753
Which means it's impossible for anyone of the three

307
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:41,953
to conspire and commit the murder.

308
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,253
Hey.

309
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:46,353
Is there someone among the three of you that used to play baseball?

310
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,853
Hey, Conan.

311
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:50,253
What a thing to ask at a time like this?

312
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,453
I used to play rugby till I graduated from university.

313
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:56,253
I played a little tennis when I was in Jr. High School.

314
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:59,353
I was a ghost member for a mountain climbing club.

315
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,653
Hado used to play baseball.

316
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,453
I hear he was an outfielder with a powerful throw.

317
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,553
But, why are you asking?

318
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,853
Well, it's just that a baseball was found at the scene.

319
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,753
I'm pretty sure that ball

320
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,653
is what everyone at the baseball club gave Hado

321
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:18,753
when he graduated from high school.

322
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,753
Hado always had the ball on him.

323
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:23,453
Just as would be expected from an ex-girlfriend. You sure know a lot.

324
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:25,853
You used to go with Hado since then,

325
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,753
to when he made his debut and became popular, right?

326
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:32,453
Then, you tried to take this beautiful manager here away from him,

327
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,953
but was brushed off just like that, right, Mr. President over there?

328
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:37,253
That was years ago.

329
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:39,153
No big deal.

330
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,853
A twisted affair and Hado's death.

331
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:46,253
I wonder what kind of distorted emotion lies deep within.

332
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:50,453
By the way, do you happened to know where Mr. Hado's cell phone is?

333
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,853
We couldn't find it in his belongings in the waiting room.

334
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,353
Hado used to always carry his cell phone in his chest pocket.

335
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:03,353
Cellphone in his chest pocket...

336
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,253
Cell phone...

337
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:11,153
Cell phone...

338
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,253
Hey, Scotch!

339
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,553
Gosh!

340
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,453
No use listening to his heartbeat.

341
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,153
He's dead.

342
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:25,553
I pierced right through his chest with my gun.

343
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:29,353
Rye, you jerk!

344
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:31,553
You haven't heard?

345
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:35,553
He's a spy of the Japanese Secret Police.

346
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,653
It's too bad that

347
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:43,053
I fired at his chest pocket and busted up his cell phone and all.

348
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:46,853
So unfortunately, we don't know his true identity.

349
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,853
It's like we killed a ghost.

350
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,553
You're to blame for this.

351
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:57,453
Mr. Amuro?

352
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,353
Mr. Tohru Amuro?

353
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:00,353
Yes?

354
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:03,653
Please write your name and the phrase "I'm sorry" here.

355
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,653
Why?

356
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,653
Weren't you listening?

357
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:11,053
This piece of paper was in Mr. Hado's pocket.

358
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,153
We want all of you in this hall to give us your handwriting

359
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,653
because we will sent it out to have it analyzed.

360
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,953
I see.

361
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:21,853
Hey, Conan. What was Azusa's last name?

362
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,953
Enomoto. Why?

363
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,453
Thank you.

364
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,453
Please write something too, Azusa.

365
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:33,253
Okay.

366
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,053
Vermouth...

367
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,653
She knows that I've seen through her disguise

368
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,753
and yet she being really bold about it.

369
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:41,953
She knows that I'm not going to make a fuss about it

370
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:44,653
because I don't want to get Ran and the others involved.

371
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:47,453
Angel...

372
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,953
Angel...

373
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:54,053
Somebody called me this some place before.

374
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,753
Thank you very much.

375
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,053
Next, Ms. Enjo please.

376
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:01,353
It's surprising you knew Azusa's last name.

377
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:02,953
If you told me beforehand,

378
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:05,753
I could've been more prepared and give you more information.

379
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:09,053
Yet, why did you come disguised as Azusa?

380
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:13,853
I could've handled checking the lyrics that weren't released yet alone.

381
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:18,953
I got anxious when I heard that you were coming here with them.

382
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:22,753
Whether you'd keep you promise with me.

383
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:24,253
That thing about no matter what happens

384
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:27,553
I don't hurt those two, correct?

385
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:31,453
More importantly, who is he?

386
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:36,553
He's Subaru Okiya, an upper graduate of Tohto University.

387
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:40,153
He lives in the house next to Dr. Agasa's.

388
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,853
Okay, thanks.

389
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:51,853
You're left handed?

390
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,553
Yes, sort of.

391
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,053
Does it bother you?

392
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,453
No, no.

393
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,053
When I met you last time,

394
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:00,753
you took your mask off with your right hand

395
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,053
so I thought you were right-handed.

396
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,153
Is that right?

397
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,953
Please just forget about it.

398
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,653
It's only that a man who I hate so much

399
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:14,953
enough to want to kill him...

400
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:19,953
happens to be a lefty.

401
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:45,753
"Next Episode" -You're finished. Scotch.

402
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,253
That's right.

403
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:58,753
I remember back then...

404
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,353
The one who made him do so was...

405
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:05,253
Shuichi Akai.

406
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:12,353
