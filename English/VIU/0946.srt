1
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:16,142
Hey, Mizusawa.

2
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,866
Well, Umeki?

3
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:19,966
Did you get in touch with the police?

4
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:21,966
"Umeki Hiromichi (45), Company President" -Sorry. My signal's weak,

5
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:23,666
so I couldn't reach them.

6
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,866
"Sho Mizusawa (25), Employee" -Could you try yours?

7
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,367
Got it.

8
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,366
Be careful. It's slippery.

9
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,767
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,967
The worst drought in 50 years.

11
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:56,566
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

12
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,566
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

13
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,266
A skeleton is discovered at the bottom of a dam.

14
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,366
A drama spanning time and space begins.

15
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,866
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,567
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:55,457
"The Cursed Tears of Borgia (Part 1)"

19
00:02:56,001 --> 00:03:01,501
Do you remember the case of the Cursed Tears of Borgia?

20
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,575
40 years ago, while Beika City-based Yamato TV was.

21
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,599
"Old Yamato TV (Approx. 1975)" -filming a show

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,199
to commemorate their fifth anniversary,

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,099
the leading lady went missing while wearing a prop ring set

24
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,799
with the jewel known as the Tears of Borgia.

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,400
However, suspect Yuri Saeki has been discovered after 40 years

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
as a skeleton at the bottom of a dried up dam.

27
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,499
"I Killed Them."

28
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,299
What?

29
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,599
"Sumire Saeki (20)" -It was the title of the drama they were filming

30
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,099
when my grandmother allegedly ran off

31
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
with the ring that was discovered.

32
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,699
I see.

33
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,999
At the time, my grandmother was living here in Beika City,

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,299
but after the case, the family fled under cover of night

35
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,999
because of the abuse they suffered from the media.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,099
But the ring wasn't in the car my grandmother was found in.

37
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,999
On top of that, she...

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,499
Died after being stabbed in the stomach with a fruit knife.

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,299
What? Really?

40
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,199
They didn't mention that on the news.

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,499
Yeah.

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,499
Mizusawa, the man who found the body,

43
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,899
is one of my drinking buddies.

44
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,399
My grandmother is a victim!

45
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,800
Someone must've stolen the ring from her and killed her!

46
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,499
Of course, it's a 40-year-old case.

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,099
I know it will be difficult.

48
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,300
But if you could at least clear my grandmother's name...

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,600
Very well.

50
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,399
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes...

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,099
I thought so.

52
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,999
I understand.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,899
Thank you, Inspector.

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,200
Goodbye.

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,599
What did the police say?

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,799
Like you said, it's a 40-year-old case.

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,199
Not only that, but during that time, it was underwater.

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
There's very little evidence.

59
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,599
As it stands, they're unable to conclude that

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,999
your grandmother Yuri Saeki was murdered.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,699
But the knife...

62
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,499
That knife undoubtedly took Yuri Saeki's life.

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,099
But it's possible that, for example,

64
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,399
she regretted running off with the ring and committed suicide.

65
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,699
No...

66
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,300
It's a shame.

67
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,799
I'm sorry we couldn't help, Sumire.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,999
It's okay. I understand what Mouri said.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,300
But when I think of how disappointed my mother will be...

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,899
Hey, Sumire.

71
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,299
Why was your grandmother suspected of running off with the ring?

72
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,499
Hey, Conan.

73
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,399
It was my grandmother's job to transport the ring

74
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,999
from the Yamato TV studio in Beika City

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,699
to the dam where they were filming.

76
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,399
She went missing after she left the studio.

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,699
Yamato TV was inside the aerial lighthouse building

78
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,299
that's being demolished right now, right?

79
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,100
Why don't we head there now?

80
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,100
"Beika Tower Building Redevelopment Construction."

81
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,199
There's no trace of it left.

82
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,399
Yeah.

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,300
My mother would be sad if she found out.

84
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,199
Excuse me.

85
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,699
Yuri!

86
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,699
Excuse me. You looked like an old acquaintance.

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,700
By Yuri, did you mean Yuri Saeki?

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,399
Yuri Saeki was my grandmother.

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
"Kanoya Tatsuma (72), Kanoya Construction Advisor."

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,199
What a coincidence.

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,399
I can't believe we ran into an acquaintance of your grandmother.

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,699
I know.

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,999
Yuri's...

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
Rather, your grandmother's body

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,799
was discovered by my nephew Umeki.

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,399
I thought it might be fate,

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,899
so I came to see the Yamato TV building being demolished.

98
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,599
How did you know my grandmother?

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,199
I actually used to work for Yamato TV.

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,499
So that's how.

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,099
Yuri was a great assistant.

102
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,999
Hey.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,300
Do you remember the drama "I Killed Them"?

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,699
Hey, Conan.

105
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,699
But doesn't Sumire want to know if her grandmother was innocent?

106
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah, but...

107
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,699
It's all right.

108
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,399
None of the staff believed that Yuri took the ring.

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,499
What?

110
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,999
I was part of the main staff.

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700
I know it was so.

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,199
What? It was broadcast live?

113
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,899
How can a drama be broadcast live?

114
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,999
At the time, small stations like Yamato TV

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,299
didn't know much about video recording.

116
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,999
So they turned that lack of knowledge on its head

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,599
by calling "Killed 'Em" a "five year anniversary special live drama."

118
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,399
"Killed 'Em"?

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,800
That must be short for "I Killed Them".

120
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,099
You figured it out.

121
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,700
This industry has a habit of abbreviating everything.

122
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,599
This is how we shot it.

123
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,199
I was the one behind the camera.

124
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,300
Everyone's so young.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,999
That's her! That's my grandmother!

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,599
She looks just like you.

127
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,499
Yuri and Nagisa Asahina were like sisters.

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,699
How long did the actress Nagisa Asahina appear on TV?

129
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,899
She disappeared right after "Killed 'Em".

130
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,199
She only debuted because she was a sponsor's daughter.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,899
Nagisa wasn't a bad girl,

132
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,999
but she had terrible stage fright.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,999
"I Killed Them" -I...

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
"Nagisa Asahina (22), Actress" -I killed them...

135
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,500
Here, Nagisa.

136
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,399
"Yuri Saeki (30), Nagisa's Assistant."

137
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,299
What about apples?

138
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,999
She always had her peel them to help her calm down.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,899
Short strokes meant she was still anxious.

140
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,799
Long strokes meant she'd managed to calm down.

141
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,399
My grandmother was a good assistant.

142
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,899
But on that day, she traveled separately from Nagisa

143
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,600
because she had to transport the ring.

144
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,099
How did that happen?

145
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,499
Because there were rumors the Asahina family had purchased

146
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
counterfeit Tears of Borgia.

147
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,699
The Asahina family requested that.

148
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,399
Western history Professor Senju proclaim

149
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,499
it was genuine before the drama.

150
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,699
The jewel had to be left at the studio

151
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,599
to accommodate the professor's schedule.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,599
Yuri would bring it to the filming location

153
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,899
once he gave his testimony.

154
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,999
They could've rescheduled filming.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,499
They can't do that, Ran.

156
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
That's right, because it was broadcast live.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I was at the filming location as a cameraman.

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,299
Nagisa was the only actress there.

159
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,799
As long as the Tears of Borgia arrived by 20:20,

160
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,999
it would be in time for the broadcast.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,399
It must've been an important prop.

162
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,399
It was. It needed to arrive in time

163
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,700
for its close-up during the climax.

164
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,399
"Kanoya Tatsuma (32)" -Switching from studio to filming location

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,100
in three, two, one.

166
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,199
We did it with one camera.

167
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,699
It was a chance to show off my skills,

168
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,399
until she started slowly peeling apples.

169
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,399
She peeled apples in the drama?

170
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Yeah. It was Yuri's idea to help her calm down.

171
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,199
Being an assistant sounds like hard work.

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,399
Some actors even had her make cheat sheets.

173
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,199
For their lines?

174
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,599
Why would they...

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
Because it was live.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,699
We didn't have time to rehearse,

177
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,699
so memorizing lines was quite the job.

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
But ultimately, the ring never arrived, right?

179
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,199
Just in case, we brought the prop ring with us.

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,199
It was a cheap one, though.

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,399
Oh, right.

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,500
But my grandmother went missing ever since.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,199
We were so distracted by the commotion after filming

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,499
that we put off worrying about Yuri.

185
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,099
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,799
Did something happen?

187
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,899
Nagisa collapsed right when we finished.

188
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,899
What? Why?

189
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,499
She actually had a 40 degree Celsius fever.

190
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,799
What? She filmed in that condition?

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,099
You can't cancel a live broadcast for an illness.

192
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,299
She knew that when she was cast.

193
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,999
It wasn't uncommon back then.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,999
Does Nagisa still live in Beika City?

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,500
In a nursing facility.

196
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,800
It's called "Grand Light".

197
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,099
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,999
Asahina is out right now.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We haven't been told when she'll be back.

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,799
Excuse me.

201
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,899
Yes, front desk.

202
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,199
What? You got separated?

203
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,500
Someone's here to see her right now.

204
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,899
"Asahina" -You looked away for a minute,

206
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,600
and she disappeared?

207
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,699
You've already told her doctor, right?

208
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,900
I see.

209
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,499
She sometimes becomes panicked because of an old trauma.

210
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,399
You have to be careful.

211
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,100
She mixes up her memories of the present and the past.

212
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,599
In any case, I'm glad they found her.

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
"Asahina."

214
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,900
"Nagisa Asahina (62), Former Actress."

215
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Ran!

216
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Conan's over there. He's on the third floor.

217
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Say, "ah".

218
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
Let's peel some more.

219
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,399
Asahina, you have guests.

220
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Two young ladies.

221
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Yuri...

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,399
Yuri, I'm sorry!

223
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Forgive me!

224
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,300
Forgive me!

225
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,028
Yuri, I'm sorry!

226
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,728
Forgive me!

227
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,028
Well, I...

228
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,429
No!

229
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,328
She was supposed to be friends with my grandmother.

230
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,328
Why did she scream like that?

231
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,929
Something happened between the two of them that traumatized her.

232
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:25,628
That's probably what Shinichi would say.

233
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,828
If only he were here.

234
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,128
He might know where the Tears of Borgia went.

235
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:38,628
Sumire, do you know what "I Killed Them" was about?

236
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,828
Yes. There was once an old family

237
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,429
that kept the historically significant Tears of Borgia.

238
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:53,828
Back then, there was a notorious thief known as "Red Hood".

239
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:59,129
Red Hood declared that he would steal the Tears of Borgia.

240
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,928
The police were powerless against him,

241
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,328
and no one knew what he looked like beneath his hood.

242
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,129
That's the story.

243
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,328
What happens to the Tears of Borgia?

244
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,228
A maid comes up with an idea.

245
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:21,229
She was played by Nagisa Asahina.

246
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,528
He'll find it if it's hidden,

247
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:28,028
so it should be kept in plain sight.

248
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,128
A fake jewel is locked inside the mansion's safe,

249
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:35,529
while the real one is kept on the maid's finger.

250
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,528
But Red Hood's true identity

251
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:44,128
is actually her boyfriend, the butler.

252
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,328
A common story.

253
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,928
While the thief waits for an opportunity to strike,

254
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,428
the maid is sent to some distant mountains by the master.

255
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,628
Excuse me.

256
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,928
Thank you for waiting.

257
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,828
About your meeting with Asahina...

258
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:02,928
Yes?

259
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,728
I'm sorry, but Asahina isn't doing well.

260
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,129
Could you come back another day?

261
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,328
They're worried her symptoms might get worse.

262
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,028
When you put it that way, we don't have a choice.

263
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,128
Hey, you!

264
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,528
Yes, you!

265
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,628
You're Yuri Saeki!

266
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:29,328
Yuri was my grandmother.

267
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,328
What a coincidence.

268
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:35,528
I'm first-rate Western history professor Senju.

269
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,728
You can't say that yourself.

270
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:39,128
Huh? Senju?

271
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:41,128
Wasn't he on TV?

272
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,528
You're right.

273
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,429
He must know about your grandmother.

274
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,828
"Senju Hideo (88)" -You were exactly my type.

275
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,029
I'm delighted to see you again, Yuri.

276
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,829
That's my grandmother.

277
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,328
You were the only saving grace

278
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:03,528
of that incredibly unpleasant program.

279
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:07,528
You truly were my ideal woman.

280
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,328
That wasn't me.

281
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,929
Don't be shy, Yuri.

282
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:20,328
Shall we get going, Sumire?

283
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,628
Indeed, how rude!

284
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,528
Don't you agree, boy?

285
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,729
What?

286
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,628
Don't you remember, Yuri?

287
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:32,928
What did Yamato TV say about that program?

288
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,928
I don't know.

289
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,028
That's right! I told you because you didn't know!

290
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,028
The Tears of Borgia was fake!

291
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,629
It never actually existed!

292
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:48,928
But Yamato TV didn't care about the truth.

293
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,228
They asked me to say it was real.

294
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,828
A sponsor's request?

295
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,228
What do they think history is?

296
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:02,029
What did you say on the broadcast?

297
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,928
That I'd overlook it since it was a legend,

298
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,428
but that the owners embarrass themselves

299
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,528
if they insisted it was real.

300
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,328
Really?

301
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,728
The TV station was displeased

302
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,528
no matter how much I denied its existence.

303
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,628
You're the only one who listened to me, Yuri.

304
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:23,528
That's why I fell in love with you.

305
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:24,629
What?

306
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,129
What?

307
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,129
"Nonogaki Real Estate"

308
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,128
I'm here on time.

309
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,429
Mizusawa, hey!

310
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,728
Shut up, you idiot!

311
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:46,128
Mizusawa!

312
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,328
Hey, Mizusawa!

313
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,429
Didn't you want to talk to me?

314
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,328
Open up. Hey!

315
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,429
It's open.

316
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,228
Hey, Mizusawa.

317
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:04,628
Didn't you say something about the whatever of Borgia?

318
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:05,929
Mizusawa.

319
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:11,729
Something's burning.

320
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:18,728
What is that?

321
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:20,329
It's Mizusawa's phone.

322
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,929
A fire? Could it be...

323
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:27,929
Mizusawa! Hot...

324
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,528
Hot...

325
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,129
Mizusawa!

326
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,728
I warned the Asahina family that employed you

327
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:43,528
not to embarrass themselves.

328
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,028
Don't put this counterfeit on TV.

329
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,128
You looked at me with your cute round eyes and nodded.

330
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,229
My heart was pounding.

331
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,228
Excuse me, professor.

332
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,628
Boorish machine.

333
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:00,428
Inspector Megure?

334
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,728
Hello? Yes.

00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:08,028
How is he?

337
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,729
Is he all right?

There's something I want to check at the filming location.

I don't see anything.

-Not right now. -Huh?

I knew it.

346
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:03,628
Knew what?
