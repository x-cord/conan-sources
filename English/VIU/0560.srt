1
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:02,428
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:07,263
Six talented young people used to live there in the past.

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,763
However, three years ago

4
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:12,363
when one of the women there died of a heart attack,

5
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:16,963
people began calling the House of Hope the House of Death instead.

6
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:20,563
Another tragedy occurs at the house.

7
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,463
The husband of the woman who died,

8
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,063
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:28,263
was found locked up and starved to death in one of the rooms.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,563
Just before he passed on,

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:35,063
Mr. Akashi painted the wall on one side entirely red.

12
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:38,363
What on earth does this mean?

13
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,163
We deduced that the culprit

14
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:43,663
must be among the four who used to live in the house in the past,

15
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:46,063
and went to talk to the suspects together

16
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,363
with Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, rival to Inspector Yamato

17
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,363
of the Nagano Prefectural Police Station.

18
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:54,563
Among them, Mr. Shiro Naoki acted quite suspiciously.

19
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:57,763
So, we visited his apartment again the following day,

20
00:00:57,763 --> 00:01:01,063
but found that Naoki was murdered.

21
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:03,563
Just like Mr. Akashi, he was seated in a chair,

22
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,063
facing the wall that was painted red.

23
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:08,263
The only difference was,

24
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:12,463
the chair that Naoki was seated on was not painted white,

25
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:15,163
and that there was no black chair in the room.

26
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:18,063
Moreover, it looked to be that the culprit,

27
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:21,463
not the victim had painted the wall.

28
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:25,163
Is the killer challenging the police?

29
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,363
Or...

30
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,363
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

31
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:32,863
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

32
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:34,863
Inspector Koume is attacked by the culprit.

33
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,263
The mystery of the red wall is finally solved.

34
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,763
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:40,563
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,063
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,772
But, if you don't want him to go all out when investigating,

38
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,972
why don't you go along with him?

39
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:33,872
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

40
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,272
Last night when we went to look over the place

41
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,972
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

42
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,272
there was a strange car following us too.

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,672
That's a car from the police, right?

44
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:45,972
Yeah.

45
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:49,072
But why would you want to keep watch?

46
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,272
We just told you that the three in question

47
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,672
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

48
00:03:55,672 --> 00:04:00,872
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

49
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:04,472
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

50
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,472
and worked at the police station,

51
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,872
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

52
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,072
Then, don't tell me...

53
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:15,472
Yeah. Takaaki Morofushi

54
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:18,072
is also a suspect!

55
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:25,072
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Koume Dies)"

56
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:31,672
What? You mean? Really, are you serious?

57
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,672
Yeah, so I'd like to confirm...

58
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,372
Where and what were you doing

59
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,172
between 10:00 to 11:00 last night?

60
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,372
About that time,

61
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:44,372
I was in my room reading the script for my next drama.

62
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,272
When I completed it and went to bed,

63
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,772
I think it was after 2:00 am.

64
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,972
I mean, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

65
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,272
This is just in case.

66
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:58,672
Can somebody testify for you?

67
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,072
My wife was already sleeping at 9:00 pm, so...

68
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:04,672
But a family member cannot testify for you.

69
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:09,072
Was there something strange about Shiro recently?

70
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:11,072
Like, him being jittery or something.

71
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,372
I wonder because I haven't seen him for a while.

72
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:17,272
But, Shusaku seems to have been seeing him frequently.

73
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:20,872
It seems that Shiro's band was not doing well.

74
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:23,572
And Shusaku said that he used to come frequently,

75
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:25,372
begging for money.

76
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,572
Oh.

77
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:33,172
What was I doing last night between 10:00 and 11:00?

78
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:37,672
Oh my, so you suspect me of having killed Shiro too?

79
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,472
You suspect me too, you say?

80
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,272
An officer with slant eyes and a mustache came last night

81
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:45,472
and asked me the same question, so this is what I told him!

82
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:49,772
"I was here alone designing, bug you?"

83
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:53,272
That Koume, beat me to it.

84
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:55,272
Koume...

85
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,972
you mean the name of that officer is Koume?

86
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,372
Yeah! His nickname is Koume,

87
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:03,672
a classmate of Aoi Kobashi that you know well too!

88
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:07,572
Then, the famous detective who appeared in Aoi's book is...

89
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:12,572
And? That man Shiro Naoki, was he acting strange recently?

90
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,972
I wonder... I heard that he was having money problems but...

91
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:18,172
Oh, that's right!

92
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,072
He was saying he was going to take a trip abroad!

93
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:24,972
I asked him if he could come up with the cash needed to travel too.

94
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:29,772
Gosh, an officer again?

95
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:33,072
Like I just said a while ago, from 10:00 to 13:00 last night

96
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:36,072
I was crashed out on the sofa in the next room.

97
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,972
So, Koume already came here too.

98
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:42,072
Then, can anyone testify for you?

99
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:47,272
Try asking my friends who came to wake me up every hour!

100
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,472
Well, I did have a blanket over me,

101
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:54,072
so they may not be able to tell you if I was really there or not.

102
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:57,172
Then, was Mr. Shiro Naoki

103
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,672
acting strange or something lately?

104
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:01,272
Beats me.

105
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:05,172
It was some time ago that he came to persistently beg me for money.

106
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:08,672
So, I bawled him out and never saw him since.

107
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,472
Oh, but it seems he came up with the money.

108
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,172
He was saying that he was going to a place in Italy called Lecce.

109
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,572
He sent me a mail saying that.

110
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,772
"If I'm gone, try searching me there."

111
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,672
Lecce in Italy?

112
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:25,272
By the way, is it true that the slant eyed, officer with a mustache

113
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,272
is the model for the famous detective

114
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,872
that appears in the book that Aoi wrote?

115
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:33,172
Yeah but, how did you know?

116
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,072
Because Yamabuki called me just a while ago,

117
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:39,072
saying that Midorikawa was surprised too.

118
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:46,372
We went around asking the three suspects questions

119
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:49,372
but all three of them virtually had no alibi.

120
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:50,572
Right.

121
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:55,172
We have to solve the mystery of red wall after all.

122
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,372
Red wall.

123
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:01,872
If that was really Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message,

124
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,672
why did he paint the entire wall red?

125
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,572
I can see why he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

126
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,472
so that everyone could obviously see it, but...

127
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:25,872
Right, he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

128
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:30,472
because it's most likely that the culprit would be the first one

129
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,272
to come visit here, after he starved to death.

130
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:36,072
That means he was afraid that the culprit would find it and erase it...

131
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,372
Erase...

132
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:38,572
red...

133
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,772
wall...

134
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,572
Wall?

135
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:05,072
I see.

136
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:30,772
Koume is not necessary in this murder performance.

137
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:33,572
I need you to leave soon.

138
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:39,172
What? You lost track of Koume?

139
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,872
What the heck do you think you're doing, Uehara?

140
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,672
Sorry! Just as we were entering Gojo Forest,

141
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:45,772
he suddenly stepped on the gas and...

142
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:49,772
Gojo Forest is where that house is!

143
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,872
I'm sure Koume's headed for the house!

144
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:52,972
Go there on the double!

145
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:54,772
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:58,272
A mail from Koume.

147
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:01,172
Maybe he figured out who the culprit is.

148
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:04,772
What? What's written?

149
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,472
Koume... dies...

150
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:14,672
That doesn't sound very pleasant.

151
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:17,672
Hey, Uehara, did you find Koume?

152
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:22,472
Well, I just arrived at the house now, but...

153
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:28,772
It's on fire... the House of Death!

154
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,972
What? The house is on fire?

155
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:33,772
What?

156
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,472
And, Koume? What about Koume?

157
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,372
I don't know,

158
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,872
although his car was parked in front of the house.

159
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:45,672
The house was already in flames when I got here!

160
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,372
Koume, don't tell me that you...

161
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:50,572
He beat us to it, again.

162
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,572
Inspector Morofushi!

163
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,563
Ko... Koume.

164
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,863
If he's in there, he's probably already...

165
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,763
Oh, no.

166
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,763
As soon as I solve the mystery of the case,

167
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:28,063
I'll contact you first thing.

168
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:32,963
Koume, you haven't contacted me and reported on the case yet!

169
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:34,163
Darn it!

170
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,863
Hey, you?

171
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,363
Don't, Inspector Yamato!

172
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,463
No use going in now.

173
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:43,663
Shut up! You can't tell unless you go in.

174
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,463
Look.

175
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,563
I don't think there's any point in going in now, is there?

176
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,563
Ko... Koume!

177
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,063
Hey! What happened?

178
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:02,363
I went around the backdoor because it wasn't on fire yet,

179
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,363
and found him in that room in question.

180
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,763
He seems to have been hit by someone.

181
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,363
Koume, who was it? Who did this to you?

182
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:14,063
No use. He completely passed out.

183
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:17,263
But, he was struck on the back of his head.

184
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,263
If he was attacked from behind,

185
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,063
he may not have seen the attacker.

186
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:26,863
But, maybe the attacker is one of the people that are here.

187
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:29,363
Hey. What brings you all here?

188
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:30,563
Well, you see.

189
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,563
We were summoned.

190
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,663
By cell phone text mail.

191
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,063
By text mail?

192
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,363
Who sent you the mail?

193
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,563
You, inspector.

194
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:42,063
What?

195
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:44,863
It said that you wanted us to come here

196
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:48,163
because you wanted to confirm something at this house where Shusaku died.

197
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,563
Am I right?

198
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,963
Yes. At 14:00.

199
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:55,563
And, when we got here, the house was up in flames.

200
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:59,863
Didn't you think it was strange that I would send you mail?

201
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,563
Well, it did bother me a bit but...

202
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:06,463
When I called the two, they said they both got the same mail so...

203
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,963
The contents and the mail address were the same

204
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:11,263
so I had no doubts.

205
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,863
Then, you all came together?

206
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,963
No. It said to come alone.

207
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,863
That's what was written in the mail.

208
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,163
"Arano Hospital."

209
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:33,263
Mr. Shiro Naoki's cell phone?

210
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:36,863
The text mail was sent to the three from his cell phone?

211
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,063
Yeah.

212
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,663
The culprit probably after killing Shiro Naoki,

213
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:44,063
stole his cell phone, changed the mail address

214
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,363
and sent the same mail to all of them including himself.

215
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:50,063
I see.

216
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,363
The suspects are.

217
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:56,063
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

218
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,763
and Mr. Takuto Momose.

219
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,963
By summoning the other two,

220
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:03,663
the culprit wouldn't be the only one without an alibi

221
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:06,463
when the house was set on fire.

222
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:09,663
But, why did the culprit have to set fire to the house?

223
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,763
Maybe he figured it out?

224
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:16,463
That the dying message of the red wall that Mr. Akashi painted

225
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:19,363
indicated who he was!

226
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:22,663
So, he decided to burn the house down.

227
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,863
And Koume unfortunately happened to be there.

228
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,663
Therefore, the culprit had no choice

229
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:31,463
but to knock him down and decided to burn him to ashes house and all.

230
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,563
And?

231
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:35,163
What is the meaning of that red wall?

232
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:36,663
You've figured it out, haven't you?

233
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:39,263
I wish.

234
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:44,563
Deadly attack Drill Punch!

235
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,163
Conan!

236
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:50,963
Talking like you know it all when you don't know a thing!

237
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:54,363
Well, the first murder site was burned to ashes,

238
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:57,163
but we got another hint.

239
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,063
The message that Koume sent to my cell phone.

240
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,563
Koume dies.

241
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:09,663
But, it could be that the culprit deliberately sent it to you.

242
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,463
I don't think so.

243
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:14,063
Because that message is cut part way

244
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,163
and it also says that he will contact Inspector Yamato

245
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,163
when he solves the mystery.

246
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,463
That's why I think that Inspector Morofushi who got hold of something

247
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,263
was planning to inform Inspector Yamato about it by mail

248
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:27,263
but got attacked by the culprit.

249
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:31,163
I think he tried to send it out before he passed out.

250
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,763
Why did he stop part way?

251
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,163
Maybe the culprit sent it as a pun

252
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:38,063
using the name of the great strategist Koume Shokatsuryo,

253
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,963
and the nickname of Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, Koume

254
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,863
and sent it?

255
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,963
The message, "Koume dies".

256
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:47,363
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

257
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,363
Huh? What does that mean?

258
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:56,863
Seeing strategist Koume Zhuge Liang's men (Shoku) stopped battle,

259
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:58,963
the general of (Gi) the opposing forces, Yi Sima

260
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:01,463
who confirmed that Koume had died of an illness,

261
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,863
immediately counter-attacked with a large number of men

262
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,963
but since Koume's men, stuck to orders given by Koume

263
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:10,063
as if he were still alive, and showed signs of counter-attacking,

264
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,463
the men of the opposing forces believed that Koume was not dead,

265
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:15,363
and suspected that this was some kind of strategy against them,

266
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:17,963
so they retreated!

267
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:21,563
In other words, the power and influence of a person

268
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,863
will keep his opponents in fear even after death.

269
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:29,163
Which means that "Koume dies"

270
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,763
refers to Mr. Shusaku Akashi who was starved to death

271
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:34,463
and "living men" refer to the culprit.

272
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:35,463
In other words, Mr. Akashi

273
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:39,563
was trying to scare the culprit using the red wall,

274
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:43,163
and white and black chairs that were nailed to the floor.

275
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:45,463
It's difficult to figure out what his intention was.

276
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,863
Yeah. And more so what baffles me is...

277
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:52,563
why did the culprit deliberately leave only

278
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:57,563
the message using the red wall behind, when he murdered Shiro Naoki.

279
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:01,663
If that was a message to provoke the police...

280
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:04,163
Was he all that sure,

281
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,263
that the police would never figure out it was him

282
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,663
just by looking at the red wall?

283
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,263
Was he all that confident?

284
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,263
I wonder if the culprit's motive for killing

285
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,963
was really for Aoi?

286
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:19,263
Could it be that it had to do with something red,

287
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,063
so he painted the wall red?

288
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:24,563
No doubt his motive was to avenge Aoi's death.

289
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:25,863
I told you, didn't I?

290
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:27,363
That when Aoi had a heart attack

291
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,963
at the warehouse of that house three years ago,

292
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:35,763
she died because her husband Shusaku Akashi left her there to die.

293
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,863
It's exactly the same as

294
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,963
when Shusaku Akashi was locked in the room

295
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:43,263
and left to starve to death.

296
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,163
But, I don't think that's enough.

297
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,863
On the day that Aoi passed away,

298
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,963
it seems that the three suspects

299
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:53,163
as well as Mr. Shiro Naoki who was killed last night,

300
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:56,263
got a call from Aoi,

301
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:59,363
asking them if they remembered where her husband Shusaku

302
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,563
put the drawing that she modeled for him for.

303
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:04,663
So, the thing that Aoi was looking for in the warehouse

304
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,163
on the day that she died was...

305
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:10,963
Yes. She was looking for her portrait.

306
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:14,063
She also seems to have asked Shusaku for its whereabouts,

307
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,363
but he practically ignored her

308
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,863
saying he was busy working on a piece of artwork.

309
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,763
It seems that Aoi used to take that portrait out

310
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:27,863
on her birthday every year and hang it in her room.

311
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:30,563
She died a day before her birthday

312
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:34,363
so it's not surprising if someone held a grudge against what happened.

313
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,563
Well, if Koume regains consciousness,

314
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,963
we'll know whether this "Koume Dies"

315
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,863
was sent by Koume himself or not too.

316
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:46,663
If it's so, I can understand the meaning but...

317
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,663
According to the doctor,

318
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:51,363
he says that if Koume doesn't regain consciousness by tomorrow,

319
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,363
they'll re-examine him again.

320
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,563
I see.

321
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:59,563
Sorry that although I asked you to come all the way out here,

322
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,463
you practically have no chance to do your thing.

323
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:05,763
Oh no, I'm sorry that I can't be of much help.

324
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,363
After all,

325
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,363
I guess the one that you really wanted to call over

326
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,563
was this glasses kid, right?

327
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,863
Yeah. I thought that the boy

328
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,563
would be just the right one to keep watch over Koume.

329
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:21,363
Because once he starts making deductions,

330
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,863
he gets so engrossed in it that he loses track of his surroundings,

331
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:24,863
and once he makes up his mind,

332
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:28,063
he'll cross a dangerous bridge as if it were nothing.

333
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:31,463
So, even if he won't listen to you or me,

334
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,963
I figured that he may lend an ear to the warnings

335
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,863
of an innocent kid.

336
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,963
But, he fled off on his own again this time

337
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,563
and did it again.

338
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:42,963
I'm so sorry that I'm not of much use.

339
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,963
Well, if I figure out the mystery of the red wall,

340
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,763
I'll let you know first thing.

341
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,763
Yeah.

342
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,663
Doctor, how's my wife?

343
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:56,463
She'll be fine! The surgery was a success.

344
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,563
What's wrong, Ran?

345
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,263
Oh, well, I was just wondering why surgical gowns

346
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:04,263
are all light green colored!

347
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,063
-Huh? -You see,

348
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:09,863
all the other doctors and nurses wear white lab coats, don't they?

349
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:13,463
True but why now?

350
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:18,063
Well, the incident this time has to do with color, right?

351
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,863
So, I was thinking about color.

352
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,263
Oh, I know why!

353
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,763
Surgical gowns are light green

354
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:28,663
because during surgery you see a lot of blood.

355
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:31,263
If you keep looking at the blood...

356
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,963
The after image of the color...

357
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:35,263
Makes you lose concentration.

358
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:45,063
I get it!

359
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,963
Only looking at this red wall

360
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:50,763
will not lead to figuring out what the dying message is!

361
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,663
You can only figure out the message

362
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:56,363
by considering the white wall a pair!

363
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:59,363
What's wrong, both of you?

364
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:05,863
The mysterious incident that occurred at the House of Hope.

365
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:08,863
The illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi who lived in that house

366
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:12,263
was locked in his room and starved to death.

367
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:14,963
Strangely, one side of the wall at the site,

368
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:17,563
was painted entirely red by Mr. Akashi.

369
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,263
There were two chairs

370
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:22,963
one black and one white nailed to the floor.

371
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:26,263
Mr. Akashi was found dead seated in the white chair

372
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,163
facing the red wall.

373
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:33,463
This seems to be a dying message left behind by Mr. Akashi.

374
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:34,963
The start of the incident seemed to be

375
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:37,963
because of a grudge held against Mr. Akashi

376
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,263
for leaving his wife, maiden name Aoi Kobashi

377
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:44,063
to die of a heart attack three years ago in the warehouse.

378
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,963
That was not the end of the incident, though,

379
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,663
as soon as we started the investigation,

380
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:52,163
a former resident of the house, Mr. Shiro Naoki

381
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:54,563
was murdered at his apartment.

382
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,163
Moreover, his body was seated in a chair,

383
00:21:57,163 --> 00:22:01,063
and the door of the closet in front of him was painted red.

384
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:04,363
Yes. The culprit had reproduced

385
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:07,563
the scene of when Mr. Akashi's dead body was found.

386
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:10,563
Could he be challenging the police?

387
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,363
The suspects are three of the six

388
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:16,963
who are still alive that used to live in the house before.

389
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:19,363
Actor Mr. Naoki Midorikawa.

390
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:24,563
Fashion designer Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

391
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:27,863
and CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose.

392
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:32,463
That person's name is undoubtedly

393
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:36,263
indicated in Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message!

394
00:23:57,763 --> 00:24:00,363
Mr. Shiro Naoki said,

395
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:04,063
he was leaving for a place called Lecce in Italy, right?

396
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,763
I've got a good idea, then.

397
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,363
I've got one too.

398
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,163
Why don't you indicate your strategy with one letter

399
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,263
and show to each other using your cell phones?

400
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:16,963
This is after all...

401
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:20,263
The Empty Fort Strategy!

402
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:23,263
Next Conan,

403
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:30,463
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Empty Fort Strategy)"

404
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:44,211
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:46,305
"Italy."

406
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,305
Talking of Italy...

407
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:48,305
What comes to mind is of course wine.

408
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:49,305
Red, white and rose.

409
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,505
Is drinking all you can think of?
