1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,806
We got involved in the murder case

2
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:05,906
that occurred on the Bell Tree Express.

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:10,106
The case was solved.

4
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:13,806
Furthermore, it was found that the man with the burn

5
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:17,406
who was going around on board the train was Vermouth.

6
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,906
In the meantime, a dark shadow closed in on Ai

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:22,606
who had returned to an adult's form after drinking the antidote.

8
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:33,806
Just as expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

9
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:36,106
You look alike.

10
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,206
How do you do?

11
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,406
Bourbon...

12
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:48,306
This is my code name.

13
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,206
With the cooperation of my mother, Subaru Okiya,

14
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:54,506
and the helping hand from Thief Kid who came to check the place out,

15
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:58,606
we succeeded in protecting Ai from those guys. However...

16
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:11,206
If so, couldn't you have explained it beforehand?

17
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:12,506
Well...

18
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,206
I was really surprised.

19
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:16,206
I desperately fled into Room B of carriage number 7

20
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,006
because the door was open,

21
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,906
then found your mother waiting for me there.

22
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,206
And she told me, "Leave the rest to me".

23
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:25,506
I had no idea of what was going on!

24
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:28,506
On top of that, you came into that room later,

25
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,806
and pushed your cell phone on me.

26
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:33,006
Was I supposed to tell you

27
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,006
that Thief Kid disguised as you

28
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,506
and confronted the Black Organization?

29
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,706
I thought that was some kind of joke.

30
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:45,906
Come on now. We weren't really sure

31
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,806
if those guys were coming on board the train or not.

32
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,306
I was off my guard as well,

33
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:53,606
until I got a text mail from Mom saying that Vermouth

34
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,206
was on board the train too.

35
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,006
It also seemed that our room was tapped,

36
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:01,606
so I couldn't really say anything.

37
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,706
It seems that Subaru who hacked your cell phone,

38
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,706
saw the mail from Vermouth.

39
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:10,406
He thought it might be too dangerous, so he went to get you.

40
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,606
Hacking?

41
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,206
Just as expected, it was lucky

42
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:17,006
that you ran into Room B of carriage number 7.

43
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,706
Who is that guy named Subaru, anyway?

44
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,406
Why is he living together with your mother at your place?

45
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:28,806
It's okay. He's on our side.

46
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:33,006
Besides, Mom only comes around on weekends every so often.

47
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:37,906
Well, the best result we achieved this time was finding out

48
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:40,806
that Amuro who did part-time work at the Poirot coffee shop

49
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:44,406
is Bourbon, one of their comrades.

50
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:48,406
Come to think of it, it seems he hasn't been to work

51
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,606
because he's not in good health.

52
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:51,706
Yeah.

53
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,806
It's a mystery as to why he did part-time work at Poirot,

54
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,406
but I don't think he'll be back anymore.

55
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:02,506
Fortunately, it seems that he thinks you died in that explosion.

56
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,606
I was thinking that if he dared to come back,

57
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:09,206
then I would check him out this time.

58
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,806
At any rate,

59
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:13,106
if you ever do something like this without telling me again,

60
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,506
you won't get away with it!

61
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,506
I feel so deceived,

62
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:21,006
and I'm not happy or anything, you know!

63
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,306
Can I take that as

64
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:25,106
your way of saying "thank you"?

65
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,106
How stupid!

66
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:34,406
Hey. Ai is sort of a sweet-and-sour type.

67
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,806
Which part of her is sweet?

68
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,206
Aim for a 100% solution.

69
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,706
Clear all mysteries and codes.

70
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,706
When I came to, I was in a locked room.

71
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,406
What on earth happened?

72
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,006
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,006
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,406
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,866
"Conan in a Locked Room"

76
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,466
Well. Thank you so much!

77
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:46,052
You invited us over to your villa in Izu Highland to compensate

78
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:51,452
for putting us through all the hassle on the Bell Tree Express.

79
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,552
Moreover, it's located near a tennis court,

80
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,152
so we can play all we like.

81
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,752
Furthermore...

82
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,252
I heard there are loads of young and healthy female tennis players, too!

83
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,952
It's just too much.

84
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:10,152
Well, it rained the last time we came.

85
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:14,152
You didn't have to compensate for anything though.

86
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:16,252
I figured I'd bring you along while I was at it,

87
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:20,252
but I'm actually going for a special tennis training!

88
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,552
A special training?

89
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:25,152
Is there a tournament coming up?

90
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:30,052
An event bigger than a tournament happened to come up.

91
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:32,152
At any rate, take a look at this.

92
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:35,452
How are you doing, Sonoko?

93
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:37,252
-It's Mr. Kyogoku! -I've recently

94
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:41,052
started incorporating tennis into my karate training.

95
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,652
I would like to have a match with you

96
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,952
the next time I return to Japan.

97
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:47,252
That's why I've decided to send you a video mail.

98
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:50,552
What's this? It's an invitation to a tennis date!

99
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,252
Yes, it is.

100
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,952
We're going to be lovey-dovey on the tennis court!

101
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,852
Just the two of us!

102
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:59,552
But if so, you don't have to train, do you?

103
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,552
Don't be silly. I'm a member of the tennis club.

104
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:06,252
I can't afford to lose easily to an amateur!

105
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,852
If so, why not ask one of your tennis club seniors to help you?

106
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:13,752
Those weaklings are of no use.

107
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:18,352
But neither Dad nor I is good enough to teach you, Sonoko.

108
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,252
Don't worry about that!

109
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,252
Right, Pops Kogoro?

110
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:26,852
Yeah! I got you a special and talented coach!

111
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,452
A special coach?

112
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,752
Why...

113
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,052
Wow, Amuro!

114
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:52,652
He's just like Nadal.

115
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,652
Well, I've been hearing that since I was in intermediate school.

116
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,452
How embarrassing.

117
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:00,152
Why is he here?

118
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:03,152
I was surprised when the manager of Poirot told me

119
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,852
that you have won the Junior Tournament.

120
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,152
Well. Right after that, I hurt my shoulder,

121
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:12,452
so I can't serve as many times as before.

122
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,752
But it won't hurt to teach someone.

123
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,852
I'm counting on you!

124
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:20,152
Are you sure it'll be okay?

125
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:23,452
I heard that you weren't in good health.

126
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:26,352
I just caught a slight summer cold.

127
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,552
I'm going back to do part-time work at Poirot starting next week.

128
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,152
What?

129
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:34,152
Anyway, there are so many spectators here.

130
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,852
I think they mistakenly thought

131
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:38,452
that a pro tennis player or something have come.

132
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,652
Let's start with serve training, then.

133
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,152
-Okay. -Back down. The ball may be dangerous.

134
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,752
No, what's dangerous is not the ball...

135
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,552
-Look out! -Huh?

136
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,052
Conan!

137
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:57,852
No, Ran. Stay away from him!

138
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:01,552
He's a member of...

139
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,252
the Black Organization.

140
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,752
Well, he seems to be conscious.

141
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:12,552
It's just a light concussion.

142
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,552
But if his hands or legs go numb

143
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,352
or if he feels nauseated,

144
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,952
take him to the hospital and have him checked.

145
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,052
Yes.

146
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:23,152
-Goodbye, then. -Thank you very much.

147
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,852
I'm glad that it wasn't anything serious.

148
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,952
Where is this?

149
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,852
It's not Sonoko's villa, is it?

150
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:33,352
It's the villa of the one who hit you by her racket.

151
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:34,952
"Kotone Momozono (21), University Student" -This is my villa.

152
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,452
I'm so sorry, little boy.

153
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,452
My racket slipped from my hand because of perspiration.

154
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,252
That's why I told you

155
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:43,352
"Machi Umejima (22)" -to wrap a grip tape firmly around the handle.

156
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,752
"University Student" -You sweat a lot.

157
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,452
How disappointing.

158
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,652
If the battery of my cell phone wasn't dead,

159
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:53,252
I would've taken a footage of that shocking moment

160
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:56,252
and uploaded it on the web.

161
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,252
"Saburo Ishiguri (21), University Student" -The title would be,

162
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:01,052
"A Killer Racket Attacks A Young Boy: A Failed Killer Serve"!

163
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,952
A child has gotten hurt, you know!

164
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,452
What do you think you're saying?

165
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:05,952
It's only a joke.

166
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,652
I just wanted to soften up this heavy atmosphere.

167
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:10,452
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -Uryu could've died

168
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:12,852
"University Student" -because of that joke, you know?

169
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,252
Don't get angry.

170
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,752
We're gathering here after a long time

171
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:20,652
to celebrate Uryu's birthday, aren't we?

172
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,252
That's right. Let's not fight.

173
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,352
Uryu will be sad to know this.

174
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:27,252
-Yeah. -Yeah.

175
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:33,152
Since the boy is safe now,

176
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:36,652
everyone, would you like to have a group match with us?

177
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,252
Since we have exactly four men and women here,

178
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,852
how about a mixed doubles?

179
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,052
I don't mind.

180
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,952
Well, a match is also training, you see.

181
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,552
I don't mind playing,

182
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,752
but can we take a break before we start?

183
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:55,052
True. I'm all sweaty from the morning match, too.

184
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,552
I'm hungry, too.

185
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,352
Come to think of it, I'm hungry, too!

186
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:03,552
I'm hungry as well.

187
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,352
We're having cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

188
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:06,752
Would you all like some?

189
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,652
Yes! We'll have some!

190
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:11,252
-But is it okay? -Yes!

191
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,452
It's a token of my apology for hurting him.

192
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,152
Then, I guess I don't want any after all.

193
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:19,552
I'm going to eat the left-over ice cake from last night in my room.

194
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:20,552
I tell you.

195
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,552
You'll become even fatter

196
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:23,952
if you keep eating things like that!

197
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,952
Don't worry, don't worry!

198
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:31,152
Okay. We'll go and help prepare lunch,

199
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,352
so wait for us here, Conan.

200
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,052
Ran.

201
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,752
The person who carried me in here...

202
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:39,952
Was it...

203
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,652
It was Amuro.

204
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:44,352
He treated you precisely until the doctor came.

205
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,952
He was so reliable.

206
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,052
Conan?

207
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,352
Where are you?

208
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,452
Conan?

209
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,852
That brat said that

210
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,352
he was going to Mr. Ishiguri's room.

211
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,152
Then, the two of them went upstairs together.

212
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:05,552
It seems that

213
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,052
the air conditioner of this living room isn't working well.

214
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:10,552
Come to think of it, it really isn't too cool here.

215
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,852
Conan.

216
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,852
Your lunch is ready.

217
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,652
Conan?

218
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,352
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

219
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,752
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

220
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:28,152
That's true.

221
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:31,552
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

222
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,252
Are you joking?

223
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,452
You mean Ishiguri still hasn't come out of his room?

224
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:40,052
It's already past 3.00 pm, you know?

225
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,652
We don't have all day.

226
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,052
I knocked on the door many times.

227
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:47,152
But it seems he locked the door and fell asleep.

228
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,652
What was that sound just now?

229
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,552
It sounded like it came from Ishiguri's room.

230
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,252
I wonder if something happened?

231
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,152
What was that sound?

232
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,352
It sounded like something fell.

233
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:12,452
Anyway, it's really hot in this room.

234
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,552
I wish he'd keep the air conditioner on

235
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:15,952
because I'm sleeping here.

236
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,452
What...

237
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:25,152
Hey, Kotone. You have the spare key, don't you?

238
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:28,252
The thing is, the spare key to Ishiguri's room

239
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:31,652
has been missing since last night.

240
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,952
We've got no choice.

241
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,052
It may be a bit dangerous, but I can try

242
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,452
entering Ishiguri's room from the veranda.

243
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,952
If the window's open, I can get inside.

244
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,352
Even if it's not, I can check out the inside of the room.

245
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:46,952
True. We've done that before, too.

246
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,152
But there is quite a large gap,

247
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:51,152
so it's impossible for me to do.

248
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:55,152
It's because you don't like high places, Machi.

249
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:58,552
If you don't mind, would you like me to unlock the door for you?

250
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:03,252
I'm pretty good at things like that.

251
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,952
It seems to have opened.

252
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,852
You're fantastic, Amuro!

253
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:20,552
You're just like Thief Kid!

254
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:23,452
I have a friend who works at a security company,

255
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,352
and he secretly taught me how to do this.

256
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,552
It's a great skill to have

257
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,052
for a detective who has to search for things.

258
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,752
Something is blocking the door from opening.

259
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,052
Conan?

260
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,752
Don't open it!

261
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:46,352
Don't open the door.

262
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:52,452
Because the thing that's blocking the door

263
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,152
is Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

264
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,552
What?

265
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,552
Moreover, this is...

266
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:02,752
an impossible crime.

267
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,852
Don't tell me it's another locked room murder?

268
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,660
What? A locked room murder?

269
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,460
-Do you mean this is... -Yeah.

270
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,760
The door which is the only entrance to this room

271
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,860
is blocked by Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

272
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,460
Also, all the windows were locked from the inside.

273
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,960
Conan, I know you love mysteries

274
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,960
because you're influenced by Mr. Mouri,

275
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,560
but on this racket under the hips of the corpse wearing a tennis wear,

276
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,860
there are marks that look like scratch bumps.

277
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,060
And on the shelf near the head of the corpse,

278
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
there are similar scratches, too.

279
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,260
And if the copper flower vase

280
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,960
that is on the shoulder of the corpse was on that shelf...

281
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,360
Mr. Ishiguri could be practicing swinging his racket in the room

282
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,860
and his hand slipped...

283
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,060
and the racket that came flying hit the shelf.

284
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,960
When he bent over to pick up the racket that fell...

285
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,360
After that, he struggled and lay on his back,

286
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
then died in front of the door.

287
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,660
Maybe it's best to think of it this way.

288
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,260
But if that's the case,

289
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,260
the racket should've been closer to the shelf.

290
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,660
And if he struggled and ended up lying on his back,

291
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,960
I don't think such a heavy looking vase

292
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,160
would be on his shoulder, right?

293
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,960
Besides, on the floor right below the shelf,

294
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
there seems to be a big dent

295
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
that was probably made when the vase fell.

296
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,660
I woke up because I heard a loud bang.

297
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,860
If that was the sound of the vase falling,

298
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,460
then this certainly isn't an accident.

299
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,060
-Why is that so? -That's because...

300
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,760
right after it happened,

301
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,560
I tried touching the dead body and vase,

302
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,160
but the blood on both was already dried out.

303
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,260
That means

304
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,060
Mr. Ishiguri was already dead before I heard the sound,

305
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
and the vase on the shelf that already had blood on it

306
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,260
fell to the floor, right?

307
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,860
That... That's true.

308
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,560
It seems that the loud sound

309
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,560
was also heard by the other people who were at the villa.

310
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,460
Maybe you should confirm it with them.

311
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,160
But...

312
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,960
if that's true, why did this vase with blood on it fall?

313
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,460
Beats me.

314
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,760
Besides, how was Mr. Ishiguri's body,

315
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,560
being as fat as he is, moved near the door

316
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,860
without even leaving a trace on the floor?

317
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,960
I still don't know yet.

318
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,660
But the one who did that

319
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
came to this villa along with Mr. Ishiguri,

320
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,460
and is on the other side of the door.

321
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,760
There's no doubt that the culprit is among the three.

322
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,760
I think that's what Pops Kogoro would say!

323
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,360
So Mr. Mouri is here, too!

324
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,860
By the way, Conan.

325
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,660
Why are you in this room?

326
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,360
That's because this afternoon, a racket came flying at me

327
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,660
at the tennis court.

328
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,860
And I fainted after being hit by it.

329
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,460
The person who threw the racket

330
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
is a woman called Kotone Momozono.

331
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,160
And this is her villa.

332
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Since her place was right near the tennis court,

333
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,460
I was brought here. After the doctor examined me,

334
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,560
I slept on the bed in this room for a while.

335
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,560
At first, I was lying down on the sofa in the living room,

336
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,860
but the air conditioner in that room wasn't working well,

337
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,060
so I moved to this room.

338
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,160
But it seems that the air conditioner here

339
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,060
isn't working well either.

340
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I don't know why,

341
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,560
but when I got up, it was turned off.

342
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,960
I see.

343
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,560
By the way, what's that thing

344
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,860
on the table over there?

345
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,260
It's an ice cake.

346
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,460
It was left over from last night,

347
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,060
and Mr. Ishiguri said he was going to eat it for lunch.

348
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,960
But it has already melted.

349
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,060
What? A locked room murder?

350
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,860
The corpse was blocking the door,

351
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,960
so why is it murder?

352
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,260
But...

353
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,760
Conan who was in the room

354
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
said that he heard a loud sound,

355
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
and touched corpse and vase right away,

356
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,560
but the blood on both were already dried.

357
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
I tell you.

358
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,460
You can't tell whether he heard it right after the sound was made.

359
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,360
Because this brat was still groggy from a concussion.

360
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,760
Besides, we don't even know

361
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,060
if the sound was that of the vase falling.

362
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
A culprit committing

363
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,660
an intellectual crime like a locked room murder

364
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,060
wouldn't commit a crime that's so obvious.

365
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
Maybe it's because the culprit

366
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,360
was confronted by two big miscalculations.

367
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
The first one is that Conan

368
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,260
was wrapped up in a blanket and was sleeping in the room.

369
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,260
The other one was that I ended up opening

370
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,060
the door of that room that was locked.

371
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,660
Without these two occurrences,

372
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,960
someone would've had to use the veranda

373
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,660
and check on Mr. Ishiguri who didn't come out of his room

374
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,060
through the window.

375
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,660
By the time police arrived at the scene, cracked the window

376
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,560
and came into the room,

377
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,060
it wouldn't be unnatural

378
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,360
if the blood was dried because of the heat.

379
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,760
Besides, even if someone were to break in

380
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,460
through the window right after the corpse was found,

381
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,960
they would focus on whether Mr. Ishiguri was dead or alive,

382
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,260
and not on whether the blood had dried or not.

383
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,360
And when the police arrived, all that'd be reported

384
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,060
was that he was bleeding from his head

385
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,360
and was lying on the floor in front of the door.

386
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,060
Good work, Conan.

387
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,060
By the way, who is he?

388
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,760
He's my number-one disciple detective.

389
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,260
Number-one disciple?

390
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,360
Yeah.

391
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,160
He said he was impressed by my superb deductions.

392
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,860
Mr. Mouri.

393
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,060
Although I just decided by myself,

394
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,160
I thought that I was your number one disciple.

395
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
Is... Is that right?

396
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,460
At any rate, why don't we ask the three people

397
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,960
who were at this villa to begin with?

398
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,660
They're the only ones

399
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,060
who have motives for this murder.

400
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,260
No... No way.

401
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,160
Are you saying that the culprit is among us?

402
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,860
Right. It's very likely that there's no mistake about it.

403
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,660
But the problem lies in that locked room.

404
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,860
How on earth did the culprit come out of that room?

405
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,260
All the windows were locked from the inside

406
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,660
and Mr. Ishiguri's corpse was in front of the door

407
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,660
that opens inwardly.

408
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,560
Even if the culprit had the spare key for the door,

409
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,660
the corpse was lying in front of the door,

410
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,660
so the culprit wouldn't be able to open it.

411
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,960
On the other hand, it would've been impossible for the culprit

412
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
to place Mr. Ishiguri's body in that position after leaving the room.

413
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
Darn it.

414
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,260
How on earth did the culprit do it?

415
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,360
The spare key for Mr. Ishiguri's room hasn't been found yet.

416
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,460
What was the key like?

417
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,960
It seems to be similar to this key

418
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,060
found in the pocket of the corpse.

419
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,560
For some reason, it seems there was water in the vase.

420
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,360
I see. That's how it is.

421
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,660
The culprit ingeniously used an object that doesn't keep its form

422
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,760
and completed the locked room murder.

423
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,860
Next Conan, "Bourbon Solves the Mystery"

424
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,060
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,460
"PET bottle"

426
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,260
I should be careful of Amuro?

427
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,060
Because he's Shinichi's rival?

428
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,360
No.
