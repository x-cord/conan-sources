1
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:04,812
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,712
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:08,412
Yuka's bluebird that's supposed to bring happiness

4
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,312
turns into a case.

5
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,012
Hurry to the scene Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,412
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,212
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:17,513
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:15,389
"The Youth Detective Squad Pursues the Bluebird."

10
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,414
It sure is cold again today, too.

11
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:24,814
They say the temperature

12
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,914
is gonna be like it was in late November for three whole days.

13
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,115
Yuka.

14
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,614
Konno from Class C.

15
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:36,514
She's always standing in front of the cage watching the birds.

16
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:37,815
Yuka!

17
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,314
Ayumi.

18
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,314
Do you like birds?

19
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,114
Yes, I love them!

20
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,614
I have a budgie at home, too.

21
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,214
A blue one.

22
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,614
What's its name?

23
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:52,615
Chicchi.

24
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,814
He's two years old and perches on people's hands.

25
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,014
He also talks just a little bit.

26
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,414
You mean he speaks words?

27
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,114
I want to see him!

28
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:02,814
Okay. Do you want to stop over at my house today?

29
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,314
May I go, too?

30
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,315
Me, too! May I?

31
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:09,614
You're Conan and Ai, right?

32
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,414
-Oh, yes. -Oh, yes.

33
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:13,114
You two are also welcome to come.

34
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,614
But if all of us go at once...

35
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:16,814
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:20,514
My mother is at work and won't be home until early evening.

37
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,614
Your parents are both working. Same with me.

38
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,115
In my case, it's a bit different though.

39
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,414
Yuka's father died of an illness two years ago.

40
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:32,915
Is that right?

41
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:40,414
Hey. Let's go together, Conan and Ai.

42
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:44,314
Okay, let's all go see the hand perching budgie!

43
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,514
Let's go!

44
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,014
We did it!

45
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:48,415
What did we do?

46
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:54,115
Do you know how to tell the difference between an adult male and female?

47
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,414
Is it the size of their bodies?

48
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,014
Is it the pattern on the feathers?

49
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,814
No.

50
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:03,414
It's by the colour of the cere of the parakeet which is above the beak.

51
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:06,014
Males have blue ceres while females have brown ones.

52
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,514
Exactly!

53
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,214
But despite Chicchi being a male,

54
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:12,614
his cere has recently been turning brownish.

55
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:13,915
I wonder why?

56
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,915
Are we not there yet?

57
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:31,514
Huh? The door. It's unlocked.

58
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:32,814
What?

59
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,415
Maybe it's a thief?

60
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,115
Stand back, everybody!

61
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,015
Okay!

62
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,115
All right!

63
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:48,914
You two...

64
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:49,915
Go ahead!

65
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,615
I'm ready!

66
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,214
Who are you?

67
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,914
A thief?

68
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:03,314
Hi! Welcome home, Yuka!

69
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,914
Do you know him?

70
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,214
No, I don't.

71
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:08,814
She's saying she doesn't know you!

72
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,514
You're a thief after all!

73
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,814
No, I'm Shinya Sakaguchi.

74
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:17,114
I work at the Beika University research lab of the Engineering Department.

75
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,114
I'm a friend of Yuka's mother.

76
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:24,314
Yuka's mother manages a gardening shop in Haido City,

77
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,814
and since she's going to be coming home late from work today,

78
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:30,814
I was asked to eat out together with Yuka tonight.

79
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:34,414
Your mother said that she told you so this morning, too.

80
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,514
She didn't say anything to me.

81
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,714
-Yuka. -Please wait!

82
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,914
How did you come into the house?

83
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:44,914
Well, Yuka's mother told me where the house key is hidden.

84
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:45,915
Everybody!

85
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,615
Never mind him, and come on in.

86
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,115
Hello!

87
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,014
In other words,

88
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,515
you're very intimate friends with her mother.

89
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:01,815
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,515
Will you stop pushing me?

91
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,814
It's so spacious!

92
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,614
The garden is nice, too.

93
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,714
But why are the windows all open?

94
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,014
Oh, well...

95
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,614
I just thought that it would be nice to air the room out

96
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,615
before Yuka came home.

97
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,315
Chicchi, I'm home!

98
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:23,815
How cute!

99
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,615
Its colour is beautiful, too.

100
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,414
What's the matter?

101
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:32,415
Nothing, but it seems that Chicchi's become slightly smaller.

102
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:34,914
I don't think so.

103
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,014
It's just your imagination.

104
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,314
Chicchi! Chicchi!

105
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,215
Chicchi, "Welcome back". Say, "Welcome back".

106
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:45,114
Strange.

107
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,814
He always says welcome back when I come home, but...

108
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:52,614
I'm sure he's nervous because your friends that he doesn't know is here.

109
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,114
Did he talk this morning?

110
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,215
He said, "Good morning" very energetically.

111
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:19,315
So ticklish!

112
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:26,114
Its cere really is brown, isn't it?

113
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:27,215
Right.

114
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,914
Do you have a cold?

115
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,014
Yes, just slightly.

116
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:34,314
Is that why you're standing away from everyone else,

117
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:35,714
because you don't want us to catch cold?

118
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,115
Yes.

119
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:42,714
I wonder why he had all the glass windows open despite having a cold?

120
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:44,614
It sure is strange.

121
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,015
Let's have some juice, okay?

122
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:55,115
Hey. Could it be that you let the bird go?

123
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,514
You went to the pet shop

124
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,915
and bought a bird that looks just like the one she had, right?

125
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:07,314
You left the windows open because the bird that fled may come back.

126
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,614
I get it!

127
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,614
And you bought a bird that was a bit smaller.

128
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,214
That's why it doesn't talk!

129
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,414
Come on and spit out the truth.

130
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:17,614
No! Just what are you talking about?

131
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,315
You spilled soy sauce, didn't you?

132
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,814
When I opened the refrigerator, I smelled soy sauce.

133
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,214
Oh, right.

134
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:28,114
The soy sauce container fell a while ago when I was putting the cake

135
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,014
that I got for you into the refrigerator.

136
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:32,915
Don't you dare open the fridge of other people's houses without permission!

137
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:41,614
What's all the shouting for, Yuka?

138
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,014
Mother?

139
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,814
Hello...

140
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,214
Hello.

141
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:48,914
My client suddenly cancelled the appointment.

142
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:52,014
Mr. Sakaguchi, let's go eat out together.

143
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,514
No, I'll leave for today.

144
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:56,915
But...

145
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:06,314
Conan, Ai, see you both tomorrow!

146
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:10,114
It's already late. So go home straight, okay?

147
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,514
Yes!

148
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,214
You guys go straight home and don't go rendezvousing some place together!

149
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:17,214
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.

150
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:19,014
You've got to be kidding!

151
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,614
Oh, my. What are you all worked up about, Conan?

152
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:25,414
Conan is as dense as ever.

153
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,614
But we've got to check this out, no matter what.

154
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:29,015
Come on, let's go!

155
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,814
Yes.

156
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,814
A person who looks like this

157
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:42,014
did come to buy a blue parakeet about two hours ago.

158
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,214
Really?

159
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,215
Just as we thought!

160
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,814
It's just like what Ai said.

161
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:49,214
That man let the parakeet go!

162
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,914
But he...

163
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,115
was holding a dead parakeet in his hand.

164
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:58,114
And he said to give him a parakeet just like the one he was holding.

165
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,115
He seemed to be in a rush, too.

166
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:05,914
It's so shocking that Chicchi was already dead.

167
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,314
But Yuka said that the bird greeted her in good health this morning

168
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,914
and said "Good morning", didn't she?

169
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:14,514
Yes. Which means the bird didn't die of an illness.

170
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:18,814
Besides, it was in a cage so it couldn't have died accidentally either.

171
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:22,314
Could it be that the man killed it?

172
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:26,114
But if he rushed to go buy another parakeet after what happened,

173
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:28,914
at least we know that he didn't do it on purpose.

174
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,715
Then, did he mistakenly killed it?

175
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,614
What kind of work?

176
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:39,714
Yes.

177
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,714
Mr. Sakaguchi mentioned that he is working

178
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,514
at the research lab at Beika University, didn't he?

179
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:47,314
I was just wondering what kind of research he was doing.

180
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:50,014
Well, I don't really know,

181
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,514
but I think he's researching some kind of drug.

182
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,614
-What? -What?

183
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,314
Drug?

184
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,714
But... It can't be!

185
00:10:56,715 --> 00:11:00,114
But I'm sure it was some kind of drug.

186
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:01,714
-Conan! -Do you have a relative...

187
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,014
-Don't, Ayumi! -by the name of Kitada?

188
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:07,914
Well, because he always gets the credit.

189
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:11,114
So this time, let's solve the truth ourselves.

190
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,014
But...

191
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:14,614
Okay, Ayumi?

192
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:15,815
Okay.

193
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:39,205
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

194
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:42,105
We're sorry to have called you out like this despite your busy schedule.

195
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,306
We're sorry.

196
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:47,805
Is your research lab in here?

197
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,705
Yes, it is.

198
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,805
May we see it?

199
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:53,805
No, you can't.

200
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,305
Why not?

201
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:58,205
Because there are many dangerous chemicals inside.

202
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:59,605
Dangerous chemicals?

203
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,806
Just as we thought!

204
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:05,506
Actually, we went to the pet shop yesterday.

205
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:09,705
The employee told us everything.

206
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:12,006
Will you please explain the situation?

207
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:21,705
I'm sorry. I lied yesterday.

208
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:26,806
The fact is, when I got to Yuka's house, Chicchi was dead in the cage.

209
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:32,005
Yuka really took good care of Chicchi,

210
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,305
so I thought she'd be sad if she came back and found out.

211
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:37,105
That's why I rushed over to the pet shop

212
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:40,205
and bought a parakeet that looked like Chicchi at the pet shop.

213
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:43,405
Then, what did you do with Chicchi that died?

214
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:48,806
After I left Yuka's house at sundown, I buried it in a park nearby.

215
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:54,106
Would you please take us there?

216
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,806
We'd like to offer our prayers.

217
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,505
Now? Well...

218
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,505
You can't take us?

219
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:05,505
I'm in the midst of an experiment right now.

220
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,505
I hate to say this, but maybe some other time.

221
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,705
-I'm sorry! -Mr. Sakaguchi!

222
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,806
Hey!

223
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,505
There's something suspicious about him.

224
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:18,105
There's no doubt that he's the one who killed Chicchi!

225
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:22,105
But I wonder what he did to kill it?

226
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,506
Thank you very much.

227
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,905
Isn't it this way?

228
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,805
He probably mistakenly spilled the chemical

229
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:35,405
that he brought back from the research lab.

230
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:38,405
The chemical probably splattered into the water container of the cage

231
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:40,806
and the parakeet drank it.

232
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,705
But that's too much of a coincidence, don't you think?

233
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,806
Maybe it was an aerosolized toxin!

234
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:53,305
What's that air something about?

235
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,505
Aerosolized toxin, Genta!

236
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,705
A process where liquid becomes gas.

237
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:58,706
In other words,

238
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:03,805
the parakeet inhaled the vapour of a poison that he mistakenly spilled!

239
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:06,906
If this is what happened, everything falls into place!

240
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:13,105
Mr. Sakaguchi opened the windows and door of Yuka's house

241
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:18,405
because he thought that the vaporized poison may still be left in the air.

242
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:23,005
His eyes were bloodshot and he was coughing

243
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:27,005
because he inhaled the vaporized poison by mistake.

244
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,905
That's why he stayed away from us.

245
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:33,605
He wanted to stay away from the place he spilled the poison.

246
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,305
I see! So the thing about him having a cold was also a lie.

247
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:38,406
Hello!

248
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:40,905
Hello?

249
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,606
-Yuka. -Yuka.

250
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:47,605
Hello!

251
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,605
Thank you for all the food yesterday!

252
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,205
Not at all. I didn't do anything at all.

253
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,505
Are you shopping?

254
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,305
Yes, we're having hand-wrapped sushi tonight.

255
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,805
What a coincidence!

256
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:01,605
We're going to Doc's house tonight to eat hand-wrapped sushi, too!

257
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,505
Doc?

258
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:06,105
Dr. Agasa.

259
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,505
The inventor that lives in 2-chome.

260
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:12,406
He talks like an old fart though.

261
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:16,305
Is Mr. Sakaguchi coming for dinner, too?

262
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,005
Well, I asked him over,

263
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:21,006
but he turned me down saying that he is busy tonight.

264
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,705
Please come over again.

265
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,206
Yes, goodbye...

266
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:33,905
Was it okay not telling them about the man?

267
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:36,305
I was wondering what we should do too, but...

268
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:39,706
Maybe we should tell them after things become clearer.

269
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,905
Hello!

270
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,905
Oh, you've come!

271
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:46,905
-Doc, where's Conan? -Vinegar rice.

272
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,205
-Conan again. -I smell vinegar rice.

273
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,805
It's nothing.

274
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:52,805
He'll probably get here soon.

275
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:55,705
Haibara, would you like me to help you with something?

276
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,705
Well, would you line out the plates?

277
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,305
Okay! Sure.

278
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:06,705
The point is why Mr. Sakaguchi brought the poison to Yuka's house.

279
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:09,705
Don't tell me that he was trying to poison Yuka or her mother.

280
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,705
I don't want to think that way,

281
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,105
but the possibility cannot be denied either.

282
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,005
Then maybe he already may have...

283
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,605
Cake, cake!

284
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:22,305
He put something in the cake that he bought!

285
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,605
Genta.

286
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:27,405
We already ate the cake at her house yesterday.

287
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:30,706
Well, it's really not enough.

288
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:36,305
That's right!

289
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:41,505
Come to think of it, Yuka didn't eat the cake at all.

290
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:44,605
She probably really doesn't like Mr. Sakaguchi.

291
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,105
But then, what on earth is...

292
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,405
My hunch is that he just took the poison to the house

293
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:53,005
and hasn't done anything with it yet.

294
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,505
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here taking it easy like this.

295
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,706
Ai, here's the soy sauce. I wonder if this will be enough?

296
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,805
The soy sauce container fell.

297
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,205
Shoots!

298
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:06,505
Don't tell me he put it in there?

299
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:07,705
That's why Mr. Sakaguchi

300
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:11,605
refused to have hand wrapped sushi together with them tonight!

301
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:12,905
This is bad.

302
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,005
We've got to stop them quick!

303
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,205
What? What is it?

304
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:16,206
I'm going with you!

305
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,705
Hey, wait!

306
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,105
What's up? What on earth...

307
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,805
I wonder...

308
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,905
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya has made the mistake of a life time!

309
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:29,105
We should've told Conan about this to begin with!

310
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,105
There you go again.

311
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:33,806
What if we don't make it in time?

312
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,306
-Genta! -Genta!

313
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:53,905
The traffic light's red!

314
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,006
Quick! Quick!

315
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:58,906
Turn green! Turn green!

316
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,206
Please let us make it in time!

317
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,106
Let's go around to the yard!

318
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:14,705
We made it!

319
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:15,806
They're alive.

320
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,006
I'm so glad.

321
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:22,505
What's the matter, everybody?

322
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:26,505
Don't use that soy sauce! It is poisoned!

323
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,206
Poison?

324
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,605
What're you talking about?

325
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,505
It's not poisoned.

326
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,606
We're already using it and eating.

327
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:41,906
Yes!

328
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:44,806
Conan!

329
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,606
Mr. Sakaguchi...

330
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,605
Just as I thought.

331
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,505
I thought this is what you guys were up to!

332
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:59,205
Conan, what brings you here?

333
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,805
Based on the look on your faces,

334
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,806
it looks like your deduction is messed up.

335
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:11,205
Then is it true that when Mr. Sakaguchi came here, Chicchi was dead?

336
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:15,805
Yes. Very often little birds peck on food until just before they die

337
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:19,405
and act healthy trying to hide the fact that they are ill.

338
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,605
Why?

339
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,705
When living in flocks,

340
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:24,905
if they display any signs of being weak from an illness,

341
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:28,305
they may become prey to an enemy and lose their life, right?

342
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,405
Even if the parakeet is tame enough to perch on fingers,

343
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:33,005
it has remaining instincts of when it used to be in the wild.

344
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,305
I see.

345
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,805
That's why it could say "Good morning" healthily like always.

346
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,905
But there were signs of an upcoming illness.

347
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,405
The cere of male parakeets

348
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:45,906
seem to change from blue to brown when they get sick.

349
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:52,905
Right. Chicchi's cere became brown because he wasn't in good health.

350
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:54,905
I didn't know that.

351
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:58,905
So Mr. Sakaguchi didn't cough or have bloodshot eyes...

352
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,205
Because he inhaled poison?

353
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:05,605
No, Mr. Sakaguchi really had a cold.

354
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,505
He hadn't taken a bath for three days,

355
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,405
so he thought that he had body odour.

356
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,905
That's why he opened the windows and doors

357
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,805
to keep the smell from enveloping the room.

358
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,405
Moreover, that's the very reason why

359
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,905
he was standing some distance away from Yuka after she came home.

360
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:23,206
She's a girl. So I thought she'd dislike me even more if I smelled.

361
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,505
I'm sorry, Yuka.

362
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:31,805
He came a while ago to tell me that I should tell you the truth.

363
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:35,505
That it would save you from being hurt.

364
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:38,706
That's when I first realized how stupid I was.

365
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,605
Life is invaluable.

366
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,105
I think that you're regretting

367
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:48,005
the fact that you didn't realize sooner that he was ill.

368
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:51,705
But Chicchi was taken good care of by you,

369
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,806
and I'm sure he was really happy.

370
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:03,706
Since Chicchi's cere was brown, I mistakenly bought a female yesterday.

371
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,105
It's a budgie!

372
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,105
The cere is blue. It's a male!

373
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,905
Fantastic!

374
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,205
I was thinking about whether it's good or not

375
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:21,206
to buy a new budgie right after Chicchi died but...

376
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,206
Thank you.

377
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,906
How lucky. You've got a family now.

378
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,805
They sure are late. I wonder what they're doing?

379
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,905
Why don't you go ahead and eat already?

380
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:41,705
Right!

381
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:44,105
Even if they don't roll back, I can't speak ill of them.

382
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,605
Though I want to scream like a bream, but that's too fishy.

383
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,906
Roll it and dip it. Here goes the soy sauce.

384
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,506
Whether it's sushi or a play on words, the point is how fresh they are.

385
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:59,405
"Next Episode."

386
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:01,705
The dates of the five incidents that happened here.

387
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,205
The first one was two years ago on February 4th.

388
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,005
The next one was on July 4th.

389
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:08,205
Last year, it also happened on February 4th and July 4th.

390
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,305
And this year, it's April the 4th, right?

391
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:14,006
Which means the day before those days are all Butsumetsu?

392
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:27,306
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (The Case)"

393
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,181
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:47,305
"Habit."

395
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,105
Do you know what my seven habits are?

396
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:51,105
Biting nails, digging your nose...

397
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,106
Hey!
