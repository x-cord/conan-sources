1
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,417
"Riichi Tengan (40) Ventriloquist"

2
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:22,217
That guy...

3
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:25,017
That guy order me to...

4
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,318
kill my wife that I love with my very hands!

5
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,018
Why don't you say something?

6
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,717
That's sounds really bad, cut it out, partner!

7
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,317
You and I, we're one and the same.

8
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:59,617
I'm you and you're me.

9
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:04,118
That means that you told yourself to do it.

10
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:07,417
Cut out the joke!

11
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:08,917
I... I can't breathe!

12
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,717
Just what do you think you're doing, partner?

13
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,217
Please stop, partner.

14
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:15,418
Die...

15
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:31,018
Now you're all mine.

16
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:34,317
So, next...

17
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:38,118
Who shall I possess?

18
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,417
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

19
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:48,617
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

20
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:51,017
The doll as well as partner to a master ventriloquist

21
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:52,417
moves on its own?

22
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:53,917
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,917
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,118
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:44,195
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 1)"

26
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,494
"The Terrifying and Bloodcurdling Ventriloquist"

27
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,394
"Riichi Tengan's Dark Performance"

28
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,194
It was just a doll, but it was really scary,

29
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,694
wasn't it Conan?

30
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:04,194
Yes. Ventriloquism is really something, isn't it?

31
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:08,094
Well, I'm doing something really close to it too, though.

32
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,394
By the way,

33
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:14,094
what did the now popular and still going strong

34
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:16,594
want you to do for him, Dad?

35
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:17,794
Beats me.

36
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:20,994
We can ask him that after his performance ends.

37
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,094
He invited us to come to his live today...

38
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,594
Just what is going on?

39
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,894
What is it? Today's live?

40
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,994
Well, master suddenly said

41
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,294
he wanted to change the program for today's show

42
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,894
just before the performance.

43
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,694
Don't tell me he found out about us...

44
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:39,194
"Togawa Haruomi (28), Tengan's Apprentice" -No way?

45
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,894
He's acting strange lately.

46
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,194
"Kazuko Tengan (35), Tengan's wife" -He mumbles to himself.

47
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:47,495
Maybe he's just practicing like usual.

48
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,594
Without his doll?

49
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,894
He scares me.

50
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,094
I'm sure that one day he'll really kill...

51
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,995
No...

52
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:04,394
Excuse me, is this Mr. Tengan's dressing room?

53
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:07,295
Oh, you're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

54
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:20,895
Get out of here! Get out of me!

55
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:24,094
Stop it!

56
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,994
Please stop it, master!

57
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:27,294
Dear?

58
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,695
Don't!

59
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:38,594
You and I are one and the same.

60
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:42,095
You can never chase me out, partner.

61
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:47,194
You mean this is not an act but...

62
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:48,594
Don't tell me...

63
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,894
It's for real?

64
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:53,194
I'll do what you want me to do.

65
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:58,495
If you can't do it, I'll do it for you, partner!

66
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,894
No more, I can't take it anymore!

67
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,995
Get a hold of yourself.

68
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,494
Stop it...

69
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,594
I said! Please get out of me!

70
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,895
No way!

71
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:18,094
Dissociative identity disorder.

72
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:20,494
Or is he suffering from multiple personality disorder?

73
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:24,295
If you insist on not leaving...

74
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,494
I'll do this!

75
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:28,894
-Stop it! -Let go!

76
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:31,095
Let me go!

77
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,394
Please wait, Mrs. Tengan.

78
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:48,294
Since he's under sedation right now,

79
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,594
the doctor wants him to spend the night here.

80
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,794
Please stay here near master.

81
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,994
Then, why don't you stay?

82
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,994
I'm fed up already!

83
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:03,295
Besides, he's got his partner, the doll with him.

84
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:05,795
I'm sure that's more than enough!

85
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:17,895
Mr. Tengan got up and is asking to see Mr. Mouri.

86
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,094
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mouri.

87
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:24,794
For behaving so erratically.

88
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:25,995
I'm embarrassed.

89
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:32,094
Don't worry. I'm Riichi Tengan.

90
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,694
Myself right now.

91
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,494
He's not around.

92
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,094
Then, you're...

93
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,694
It's true that I'm suffering from dissociative personality disorder.

94
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:44,394
The so-called multiple personality disorder.

95
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:47,394
They can't definitely say that I am.

96
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:50,494
Well, the doctor was pretty ambiguous about it.

97
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,195
The same to you, partner.

98
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,494
You were always shy from before

99
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:00,194
and couldn't say how you really felt.

100
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:02,494
Even when you proposed to your wife,

101
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,294
you used my mouth to do so.

102
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,094
Really?

103
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:08,494
It's really embarrassing but...

104
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:11,394
If he wasn't around, rather,

105
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,894
if I didn't find ventriloquism,

106
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,594
my life would've been...

107
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,395
In the pits of darkness, right, partner?

108
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:24,394
And, what did you want Pops Kogoro to do for you?

109
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:28,094
Oh? Hey, you look pretty smart, son.

110
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,194
What's your name?

111
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,894
Conan Edogawa.

112
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,794
She's Ran.

113
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,095
Oh.

114
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,194
Hi, Mr. Partner.

115
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,595
Same here.

116
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,194
And, what did you want me to do?

117
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,195
The fact is...

118
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:50,594
Hey. Is it okay to tell him?

119
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,395
Shut up!

120
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:56,094
He's doing it himself, isn't he?

121
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,995
I think so.

122
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,695
Hey.

123
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,894
The fact is...

124
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,294
I might kill my wife.

125
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:09,394
He might drive me to do so.

126
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,095
What?

127
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:15,694
When I'm home alone, I hear him.

128
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,095
I'm not doing ventriloquism, and yet...

129
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:21,594
Kill. Partner.

130
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,594
Kill that woman. Kill your wife.

131
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,094
Partner.

132
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,494
Kill. Partner.

133
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,794
Kill that woman.

134
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,094
Kill your wife, partner.

135
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,394
Stop it!

136
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,894
Stop it, I said!

137
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:41,695
Kill her...

138
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,794
It's...

139
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,294
coming from nowhere else.

140
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:49,094
But from inside of me, that's where I hear it from.

141
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,094
From him, who's inside of me.

142
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,294
In other words, me myself.

143
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:56,094
Hey.

144
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,994
It's supposed to be a secret, partner!

145
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,194
Shut up!

146
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,794
How can I shut up?

147
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,094
That woman, of all things,

148
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:06,395
is having an affair with your apprentice, you know, partner!

149
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,794
He scares me.

150
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,894
I'm sure that one day he'll really kill...

151
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,894
No...

152
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,594
I...

153
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,694
If they're both in love,

154
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,694
I don't mind getting a divorce.

155
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,494
Don't lie, partner!

156
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,294
-It's true! -It's a lie!

157
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:25,894
It's true!

158
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,294
That's why...

159
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,494
that's why I don't want to kill her.

160
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,895
I never want to do something like that.

161
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:43,894
That was...

162
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,494
I don't know.

163
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,694
I get confused.

164
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,494
I don't know if I'm acting out the doll

165
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:55,494
or if he who is inside of me appears and talks.

166
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,094
I'm afraid of him...

167
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,494
No, rather, I'm afraid of myself.

168
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,694
When I lose consciousness, I'm afraid of what I might do.

169
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,594
Just like the program of the live.

170
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:07,494
I might someday kill my wife.

171
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:10,794
That's why I want you to keep an eye on me, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,995
Please keep an eye on me so I don't kill my wife.

173
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,594
I see,

174
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:21,294
so that's what you wanted me to do for you.

175
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,794
Please, Mr. Mouri.

176
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,695
I'm sorry but...

177
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,794
Mr. Tengan, I'm a detective.

178
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,094
I think it would be more for your sake

179
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,794
to discuss your situation with a mental specialist.

180
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,394
That's right.

181
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,394
But...

182
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,495
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,094
I understand.

184
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:48,494
Togawa, bring the car around.

185
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:50,894
But, you're supposed to sleep over here tonight.

186
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:54,294
He's telling you to bring the car around.

187
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:57,695
Talk about useless, as always.

188
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:01,995
I understand.

189
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:09,494
Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry to have put you through the trouble.

190
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,794
I'm going to change clothes.

191
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,894
See you, dorky detective.

192
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:14,095
What?

193
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,195
"Mouri Detective Agency"

194
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:32,994
At least pick up the phone, Dad.

195
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,794
Hello?

196
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,694
Yes. That's right.

197
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:39,594
Mr. Togawa? Oh, Mr. Tengan's...

198
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,794
Thank you for last night.

199
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:42,994
What?

200
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,494
Mr. Tengan killed his wife?

201
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:46,695
What?

202
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,694
Please help, Mr. Mouri.

203
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,194
Please help master.

204
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:54,395
Please help master!

205
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:15,542
You were sleeping after taking sleeping pills?

206
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:16,942
Yes.

207
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,942
I was afraid of becoming someone other than myself.

208
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,642
Lately, it's happening every night.

209
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:26,042
And this morning your apprentice and manager,

210
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,342
Mr. Haruomi Togawa came to pick you up to go to work.

211
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,842
But you didn't know that your wife was dead

212
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,842
until he woke you up.

213
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:33,942
That's right.

214
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,642
When you got back from the hospital last night,

215
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,542
your wife wasn't home yet?

216
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,842
No.

217
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:44,042
Lately she's been going out at night a lot.

218
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:47,543
It seems she comes home after I fall asleep.

219
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,443
She's out gallivanting at night!

220
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:54,943
What...

221
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:57,942
That's why when that flirtatious lady was fooling around,

222
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:01,642
my partner was fast asleep snoring in bed.

223
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:04,542
Understand, dorky officer?

224
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,742
This is...

225
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:08,942
I killed my wife.

226
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:10,342
That guy.

227
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:13,242
That guy inside of me made me do so.

228
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,842
I killed my wife.

229
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,942
Hey. Here I'm trying to establish an alibi for you

230
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,142
and you got to make that remark?

231
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:23,442
I mean, don't blame it on somebody else, partner.

232
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,742
I'm just a doll, you know?

233
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,542
If murder was committed,

234
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:31,143
you're the one who actually did it.

235
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:36,242
He looks sort of familiar.

236
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,442
Oh... no...

237
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:43,042
Is he really suffering from dissociative personality disorder

238
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,242
and multiple personality disorder?

239
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,342
Maybe he's just faking it

240
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,942
so that he won't be found criminally responsible

241
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:52,642
and is hoping to be acquitted.

242
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,242
That's also likely.

243
00:14:55,243 --> 00:15:00,343
Psychiatric tests aren't 100 percent accurate, either.

244
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,342
What should we do?

245
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:06,743
Inspector, please let me handle this.

246
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:11,142
I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri will, by all means

247
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,642
determine the truth behind this case.

248
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,943
You can put your full trust in me and rest assured.

249
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:22,342
The victim is here.

250
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:25,642
The murder weapon is here.

251
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,842
And only the fingerprints of Mr. Tengan

252
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,342
were found on the murder weapon, right?

253
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,642
Yeah. And from the way the prints were found,

254
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:36,942
he grabbed the trophy that was here like this,

255
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,542
flung it up like this

256
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,442
and struck the back of the head of the victim

257
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:42,942
who sitting on the sofa with her back turned drinking wine!

258
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,042
What's this?

259
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,243
I mean, why are you here?

260
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:52,643
I just thought I'd like to be of help too.

261
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,842
Get on home this minute!

262
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:56,742
Wait, Pops. Look over there!

263
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,343
On top of the speaker!

264
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:07,043
What's this? A speaker?

265
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:09,743
There's one over there too.

266
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,142
There too.

267
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:14,942
Moreover, it's wireless.

268
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,342
Which means...

269
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,142
There should be a recorder somewhere

270
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,243
that's used to send the sound there, right?

271
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,143
I found it!

272
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,543
It has a timer function.

273
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:30,642
-Hey, don't touch it. -Kill. Partner.

274
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:33,942
Kill that woman. Kill your wife.

275
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,842
-This... this is... -Partner.

276
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:37,042
Pops.

277
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,043
Yeah, let's report this to the Inspector!

278
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,442
Your fingerprints have been detected

279
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:47,842
from his recorder and speaker.

280
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:50,642
Will you please explain this, Mr. Togawa?

281
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,242
That's mine.

282
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:56,742
It's been missing from about a week ago, you see.

283
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,542
Where was it?

284
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:02,342
It was found set up in the living room of Mr. Tengan's condo.

285
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:06,442
It was set with a timer to go off periodically.

286
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,542
Kill. Partner.

287
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:10,342
Kill that woman.

288
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,742
What's going on?

289
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,342
It was set up?

290
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:17,242
To go off periodically?

291
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,742
Don't tell me this is what the master has been talking about?

292
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:24,043
Mr. Togawa, I think you're taking playing dumb a bit too far.

293
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,142
What do you mean?

294
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:31,042
When we asked you to appear voluntarily,

295
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:33,942
we checked the contents of your bag

296
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:36,442
and found this under the inner lining.

297
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,342
This is mine.

298
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:41,142
This has also been missing for some time.

299
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,742
Why was it in there?

300
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,342
I wonder.

301
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,842
And there's yet another problem.

302
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:51,842
Do you know what it is? The thing that's on here.

303
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,643
A blood stain?

304
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,042
Yes, DNA test results

305
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:02,542
have confirmed it to be the blood of the victim.

306
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,542
It's thought to be the blood that splattered

307
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,942
when the crime was committed.

308
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,242
Blood that splattered...

309
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:11,542
Don't tell me that you think that I killed Mrs. Tengan?

310
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:16,642
Where were you around 2am this morning?

311
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:18,743
About 2am?

312
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:22,442
I was practicing at home at that time!

313
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,142
Practicing? Ventriloquism?

314
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:26,742
My master said he'd check my progress

315
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:29,242
first thing in the morning,

316
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,942
I practically stayed up all night.

317
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,342
All alone?

318
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,142
Yes! Of course.

319
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:37,842
This is the spare key for Mr. Tengan's condo

320
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,642
that was entrusted to you, is it not?

321
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,242
Oh, yes.

322
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,842
Because I need it being that I'm his apprentice

323
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:46,142
-as well as his manager. -Either way,

324
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,342
you don't have an alibi during the time the crime was committed,

325
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:53,942
and besides you were able to freely go in and out of the room.

326
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,542
But...

327
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,442
By the way, I heard that

328
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:01,242
you were intimately involved with the victim too,

329
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,842
but is that a fact?

330
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,142
Well...

331
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,442
It's true that I had an affair with her.

332
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,942
But, that's because I'm still so immature

333
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:11,742
and was scolded by master almost every day,

334
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,642
and she was kind to me then...

335
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:17,542
She was also very lonesome all the time

336
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,642
because master was so busy.

337
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,242
It was just once.

338
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,942
We overstepped our boundaries just once.

339
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:26,242
But, the victim refused to forget the affair.

340
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:30,342
Thinking about your future as a ventriloquist,

341
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,442
wasn't her presence just an obstacle to you?

342
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,242
No!

343
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,842
That's why you killed her.

344
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,542
You made Mr. Tengan believe that

345
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,842
he was suffering from dissociating personality disorder,

346
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,942
that is, multiple personality disorder

347
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:47,242
and tried to put the blame on him. Am I right?

348
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:48,642
Wrong!

349
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,342
I regret what I did with Mrs. Tengan.

350
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:53,842
I respect master.

351
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,042
I would never do such a thing!

352
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,342
It's true.

353
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,742
I...

354
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:02,443
I didn't do it!

355
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:08,942
He's pretty obstinate

356
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:11,242
being that so much evidence is presented before him

357
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,642
and yet to deny having done anything.

358
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:16,842
But, I've already requested an arrest warrant.

359
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:19,242
It's just a matter of time before he confesses.

360
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:22,342
I should be thanking you, Mr. Mouri!

361
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:25,842
I was about to make a mistaken arrest.

362
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,642
You're a life saver!

363
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,142
Oh! Is that so...

364
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,442
I helped you out.

365
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:36,443
Thanks to me. Well...

368
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:47,343
I'm sorry for all the commotion I've caused.

369
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:51,242
I'd like to apologize from the bottom of my heart

370
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:53,642
for all the trouble and worry

371
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,643
that I caused to all my fans and staff.

372
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:00,142
You don't need to apologize, partner!

373
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:01,942
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

374
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,042
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

375
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:06,842
But what a surprise that

376
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:11,243
the serious looking Mr. Togawa was the perp.

377
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:15,142
It just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover.

378
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,742
That goes for his relationship with the victim too.

379
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,642
That did surprise me too.

380
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,042
What's this?

381
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:23,942
What's this that's bothering me?

382
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,642
Well, all is well, case closed.

383
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:28,442
Thanks to the Sleeping Kogoro,

Rather, I don't think I fell asleep this time.

386
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,042
Why not?

387
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:40,343
Oh well, I guess there are times like that too.

388
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:43,042
I'm going out for a drink.

389
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,442
Hey, Dad.

390
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:47,242
Don't drink too much and come back early, all right?

391
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:49,743
I know.

392
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,843
You don't know a thing at all.

393
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:55,342
Please help, Mr. Mouri!

394
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:58,742
Please help the master...

395
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:03,442
Would a person who wanted to frame Mr. Tengan for the crime

396
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:06,842
call Pops and ask for help in the first place?

397
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:08,643
Besides...

398
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,542
You have no idea?

399
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:45,242
Of course not.

400
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:49,842
I have absolutely no idea why it was there.

401
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,542
I get it, it's this!

402
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:54,842
This is what was bothering me all this time!

403
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,742
Sorry to have kept you waiting, partner.

404
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:00,843
Let me toast too.

405
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,042
Yes, it's impossible.

406
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,243
