1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,519
We received a letter from someone named Nichihara Taisei-san

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,480
asking us to investigate why his friend committed suicide,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,300
and came to an abandoned church deep in the mountains of Nagano.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,000
However, Nichihara Taisei-san was the man who killed himself at the church.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,750
At the instructions of the culprit who gathered us here,

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,800
we searched the abandoned church for codes.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,670
But Wada-san was murdered,

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,150
followed by Kawasaki-san.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,119
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,379
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,890
A snowy mountain lodge mystery!

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,310
Amuro and Wakita work together to solve the code!

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,079
Always determining the one truth

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,939
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,600
his name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,030
"The 36-Cell Perfect Game, Part Three!"

17
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,350
Which letter are we supposed to start with?

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,150
I have no idea.

19
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,790
If only we had a hint.

20
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,399
A hint?

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,790
There's nothing like that.

22
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,420
(Fujide Raito (27) High School Teacher)

23
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,790
You know, it's kind of annoying.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,300
If you'd tell us about the club you've kept secret from us,

25
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,600
I think it might help us solve the code.

26
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,219
We don't mind telling you.

27
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,039
Just don't laugh.

28
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,590
Most people make fun of us when we tell them about it.

29
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,570
Sounds like your phone has service.

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,690
Hello? Hello?

31
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,490
It's Yamato with the Nagano police.

32
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,319
It'll take another hour to clear the tunnel of snow.

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,120
We'll be able to come get you in three more hours.

34
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,410
Sit tight until then.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,100
Hey, wait!

36
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,660
He said they'll be here in three hours and to sit tight until then.

37
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,510
Three hours...

38
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,010
You can't be serious!

39
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,489
How are we supposed to sit tight for three hours

40
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,730
when there might be a murderer lurking in the area?

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,199
Someone else could be killed somehow during those three hours!

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,609
Maybe so, but the first victim Wada-kun headed to the toilet

43
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,490
where the crossbow trap was set because you drew his name.

44
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,249
And when Kawasaki-kun was poisoned in front of the bath

45
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,250
because he went to investigate a suspicious noise,

46
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,600
you're the one who decided how we'd choose which pair would go.

47
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,590
You think I'm responsible?

48
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,979
Was it Nishino-san who suggested the method used

49
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,159
to choose Nishino-san and Kawasaki-san's pair to investigate?

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,100
Yeah.

51
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,030
He emptied two out of three mint cases.

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,240
The pair that drew the case with mints would go check things out.

53
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,349
Naturally, with his ability to pick out losers,

54
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,599
Master Kogoro selected an empty case right off the bat.

55
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
About that...

56
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,130
I felt like no matter which case I picked, none of them would be losers.

57
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,140
What?

58
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,649
You mean it was a sham?

59
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,779
I didn't say that.

60
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

61
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,550
Are you trying to frame me?

62
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,840
I can't trust any of you anymore!

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll protect myself!

64
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,900
Wait, Nishino-kun!

65
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,560
Let's go.

66
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,010
Nishino-kun, open the door.

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,829
We don't think you did it.

68
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,219
Shut up!

69
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,250
I'm not opening this door until the police arrive!

70
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,019
I'm going to survive!

71
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,870
Nobody's going to kill me!

72
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,140
Well, he'll be safe locked inside the study.

73
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,770
As long as the murderer isn't already hiding in there.

74
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,400
Anyway, don't you think it's odd?

75
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,610
Why was the detective Master Kogoro invited here?

76
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,249
If the culprit wanted to avenge Nichihara Taisei who killed himself here,

77
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,080
they only needed to invite you guys.

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,130
Inviting a detective here would get in the way of their own plans.

79
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,130
Now that you mention it, the letter said to bring a group of four, right?

80
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,839
Including us, nine people were invited here.

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,890
Perhaps the number nine has some significance.

82
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,830
One of the benefits of the number nine is that it's easier to create lots.

83
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,859
Compared to five or seven,

84
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,440
it's easier to create nine equally-sized pieces from a single sheet of paper.

85
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,700
It's the same if you use two sheets to make lots.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,490
What else is related to the number nine?

87
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Mahjong's nine gates.

88
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,210
Beethoven's 9th.

89
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,710
The nine-tailed fox.

90
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,460
Nine-ball pool.

91
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,840
Nine!

92
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,340
That's it. So that's how it is.

93
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,480
The culprit wanted nine people to show up for a variety of reasons.

94
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,910
Which means that fourth code indicates where the next crime scene will be.

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,990
I see exactly what's going on now.

96
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,490
I know whose life will be ended next,

97
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,750
and the identity of the murderer who intends to kill them.

98
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,300
Nishino-kun.

99
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,369
Come on out.

100
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,710
Don't stay locked up inside the study.

101
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,190
It's safer for all of us to stick together.

102
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,649
Nobody thinks you did it, Nishino-kun!

103
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,820
Of course I didn't do it.

104
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,570
I'm the one who drew the lot that sent Wada to the toilet where the crossbow was rigged,

105
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,640
but I couldn't have cheated.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,250
When we went to investigate the strange sound,

107
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,750
Kawasaki's expression changed when he received a text from someone,

108
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,319
and he ran off to the bath where he was poisoned,

109
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,510
but that wasn't my fault.

110
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,510
So I'm not leaving this room until the police arrive.

111
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,489
You guys will try to pin it on me.

112
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,010
Huh?

113
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,810
A text? From Nishino, who's holed up in the study right now?

114
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,820
He figured out who did it?

115
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,140
I think...

116
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,330
the study should be around here.

117
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,650
You came.

118
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,480
I'll bring some tables and chairs over so it's easier for you to get down. Wait there.

119
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,869
So, who's the culprit?

120
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,060
First, take a look at this paper.

121
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,610
You found a new code?

122
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,869
Unfortunately, I can't read it.

123
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,440
Huh?

124
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,249
What are you doing?

125
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,159
Don't poison me!

126
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,870
Hey.

127
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,830
I don't want to die!

128
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,680
Don't kill me!

129
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,080
Then don't swallow it.

130
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,130
Huh?

131
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
That capsule in your right hand.

132
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,030
That poison.

133
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,119
Wh-What?

134
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,460
That's the plastic bottle you got from Fujide-san's bag.

135
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,530
Naturally, Fujide-san's fingerprints are on it.

136
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,030
If we testify that we heard your screams from outside the room,

137
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,030
the police would probably think

138
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,540
that Fujide-san snuck in here through the ceiling and poisoned you.

139
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,679
Even if Fujide-san claims that he received a text from you telling him to come here,

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,199
if you leave the phone used to send that message in this room,

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,050
they'd assume he sent that text to himself.

142
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,529
No, you're wrong.

143
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,060
I just panicked because you all came down from the ceiling.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,940
And like I said earlier, it was a coincidence that Wada and Kawasaki were killed.

145
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,450
No, it was inevitable.

146
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,349
You made Wada-san head to the toilet

147
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,779
where the crossbow was rigged using a trick.

148
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,160
A trick?

149
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
When you don't have scissors,

150
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,099
cutting one sheet of paper into nine equal pieces

151
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,950
creates one piece with four torn edges in the center.

152
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,180
By giving that piece to Wada-san and making him write his name on it,

153
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,920
even after putting it inside the tissue box,

154
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,220
you could identify it using the torn edges.

155
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,790
I thought he drew them relatively quickly, though.

156
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,719
Since eight out of nine sheets have untorn edges, he prioritized choosing those,

157
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,450
and left the person he wanted to send to the bathroom for last.

158
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,200
But what about the mint cases?

159
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,170
Because the last remaining case happened to contain mints, Kawasaki and I were chosen.

160
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,819
Hey, Mister.

161
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,800
You said you felt like all the cases were losers, right?

162
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah.

163
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,390
None of the cases gave me a bad feeling.

164
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,550
Of course they didn't.

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,770
After all, all the cases were empty then.

166
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,909
What do you mean?

167
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,740
It's a simple trick.

168
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,019
If I shake the case using my left hand,

169
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,830
it doesn't make a sound, but when I shake it with my right...

170
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,870
See? It makes a noise.

171
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,049
You're right.

172
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:01,050
It's because I have a spare case with mints tucked inside my right sleeve.

173
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,850
Since Nishino-san said he brought plenty of snacks, he probably had spare mints, too.

174
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,119
K-Kawasaki and I only went to check things out

175
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
because we heard the sound of glass breaking.

176
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,849
If you set the ringtone of a phone you hid in this abandoned church beforehand

177
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,339
to the sound of breaking glass,

178
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,369
you could've made it ring anytime.

179
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,919
Maybe so, but it's true that when we went to investigate,

180
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,750
Kawasaki's expression changed after seeing a text from someone, and then he ran off.

181
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,899
When Kawasaki was poisoned in the bath and shouted,

182
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,310
I was with you guys.

183
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,640
You swiped Kawasaki-san's phone and poured honey on the screen,

184
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,150
so that Kawasaki-san would remove his gloves

185
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,400
and touch it when he received a text.

186
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,739
With honey on his fingers,

187
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,910
he'd be forced to run into the nearby bath and wash his hands.

188
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,410
Come to think of it,

189
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,540
Kawasaki-san held his handkerchief in his mouth when he washed his hands.

190
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,210
By swiping that handkerchief and applying poison to the section he'd bite,

191
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,000
since Kawasaki-san drank water after every activity he completed,

192
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,930
he'd swallow the poison on his lips along with the water.

193
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

194
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,730
You guys have been going on about tricks, slight of hand, and swiping objects,

195
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,349
but it's not like I'm a professional pickpocket.

196
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,440
You're a magician, aren't you?

197
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,310
Huh?

198
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,120
A magician-turned-pickpocket I arrested long ago happened to say the same thing.

199
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,370
Hold on.

200
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,080
There's an odd stain on the top card.

201
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,990
When holding a deck of cards face down,

202
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,960
he referred to the deck's "top" and "bottom" cards.

203
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,470
I'm sure a magician could swipe a phone or handkerchief.

204
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,640
While receiving a drink from Fujide-san,

205
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,850
you apparently put a stack of blank code sheets in his bag.

206
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,209
You invited nine people to this abandoned church

208
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,240
because you wanted nine lots for the first trick,

209
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,290
but also because it's the key to deciphering the code.

210
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,480
That's right.

211
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,750
It's baseball.

212
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,239
You initially called Wada-san the wife,

213
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
probably because he was the catcher.

214
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,260
In other words, in high school, you were on a baseball team.

215
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,640
If baseball is the key word, then that code can be solved easily.

216
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,110
In high school baseball, the players' numbers are determined by their defensive positions.

217
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,340
If the square thickly outlined in the middle represents the infield,

218
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,910
then you simply read the nine letters in the order of the player numbers.

219
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,600
Based on that, the code we first received reads,

220
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,160
"It's time to play ball."

221
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,769
Yeesh!

222
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,790
The deck collapsed, and all the cars have fallen to the bottom of the ravine.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,750
The code we found next stuck to the chapel door reads,

224
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,050
"One out in the toilet."

225
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,260
The code we found in the rooms we searched reads,

226
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,310
"Two outs in the bath."

227
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,480
The code found next to Kawasaki-san's body reads,

228
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,380
"Three outs in the study."

229
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,510
And the code you just handed Fujide-san signifying a perfect crime reads,

230
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,700
"Perfect game."

231
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,799
By hiding the blank code sheets in Fujide-san's bag, you wanted to make us believe

232
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:17,030
that after gathering his high school classmates here, killing himself and two others,

233
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,350
and leaving behind an indecipherable code at the crime scenes,

234
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,510
Fujide Raito-san was gloating over committing the perfect crime.

235
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,359
Later, once the police discovered that the victims were on the same baseball team,

236
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,989
this code would be solved eventually.

237
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,110
I don't get it, though.

238
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,490
I understand you inviting Fujide-san so you could frame him,

239
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,029
but why invite Ikue-san?

240
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,500
Was it just to have nine people?

241
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,400
I wanted to show Ikue

242
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,380
that Fujide, the man you dumped your high school boyfriend Nichihara for,

243
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,879
is unbelievably evil.

244
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,890
E-Evil? What are you talking about?

245
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,390
I'm sure you guys have heard

246
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,569
about the nine-error five-inning mercy ruled perfect game.

247
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,409
Yeah, between Nagano Kawanaka Academy

248
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,530
and the high school attached to Shinano University.

249
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,910
Were you guys members of the Kawanaka Academy baseball team that lost that game?

250
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,719
Yeah. I didn't play

251
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,299
because I was injured in the quarterfinal regional preliminary game,

252
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,210
but I could tell from the other side of the TV

253
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,680
that these guys lost that game on purpose!

254
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,670
They threw the game?

255
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,749
Wada, Kawasaki, and Fujide were committing errors like crazy.

256
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,490
Since they got into Shinano University, they must've had a secret agreement.

257
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,299
The Shinano University high school lost in the finals,

258
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,190
but they became famous for their strength in academics and sports after that game.

259
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,440
And at that time, our team's ace was Nichihara Taisei.

260
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,799
Since he was a kid, he pitched crazy fast.

261
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,109
People thought he'd be drafted, but his reputation tanked after that game.

262
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,450
When he wasn't drafted,

263
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,809
he unsuccessfully tried to join non-association

264
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,260
and independent leagues and ended up a free agent,

265
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,840
so he hung himself in this church where we used to play baseball as kids.

266
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,890
All because they threw the game and I wasn't there to stop it!

267
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,890
Is that true?

268
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,890
It's true that we lost on purpose.

269
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,539
But it wasn't to get into college.

270
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,099
We did it for Nicchi.

271
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,780
Huh? What are you talking about?

272
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,379
We won the first game 1-0 in extra innings at the bottom of the 14th.

273
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,760
The second game ended in a tie after 15 innings,

274
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,500
and we barely won the rematch 1-0 in 13 innings.

275
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,309
Because he played 42 innings

276
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,250
and threw roughly 1,000 pitches in such a short amount of time,

277
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
Nicchi's shoulder was at its limit.

278
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,559
We didn't intend to lose from the beginning,

279
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
but once we started to fall behind, Wada said,

280
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,150
"Let's get the mercy rule invoked for the sake of Nicchi's future."

281
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,900
"He'd insist on pitching until the end otherwise."

282
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,829
But Nicchi's shoulder was already shot.

283
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,399
He's the one who dumped me.

284
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,530
He said he couldn't make me happy with his body the way it was.

285
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,030
No...

286
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,299
It was a coincidence that we got into Shinano University.

287
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,040
We all apologized to him after the game, but because you weren't there...

288
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,210
What...

289
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,680
What have I done?

290
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,659
The murderer didn't speak a word after that, but outside the church,

291
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,840
the blizzard continued to blow,

292
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,560
as though it was sobbing his remorse for him.

293
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,570
Three hours later, the blizzard stopped, and dawn broke.

294
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,320
Nagano police cars arrived in droves.

295
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,259
I can't believe two people were killed.

296
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,579
Sorry about that.

297
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,960
Conan-kun, good to see you again.

298
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,450
So, who are those two guys behind you?

299
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,459
I'm Mori-sensei's number one student Amuro Toru.

300
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,480
And I'm his number two student Wakita Kanenori.

301
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,359
This bum has two students?

302
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,159
Wow, just like Komon-sama.

303
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,390
Komei, let's start inspecting the crime scene.

304
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,530
Oh?

305
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,150
We meet again,

306
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,619
Mori-san.

307
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,950
I haven't seen you since the Kid case.

308
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,599
Who are those two?

309
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,130
They're my students.

310
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,500
Komei, what are you doing chatting over there?

311
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,049
Hurry up.

312
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,510
You're right.

313
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,529
Every moment is precious.

314
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,260
Not a moment should be wasted.

315
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,760
As they say, time is money.

316
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,335
(I'll kill Sasano Prepare yourself)

317
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,759
A death threat?

318
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,489
Yes. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

319
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,490
Apparently everyone has a grudge against the president.

320
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,240
That guy with the mustache must be the second.
