1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:02,002
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,172
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

3
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,042
The legendary case that took place on a remote island!

4
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:08,522
What is the mystery behind the cursed piano and melody?

5
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,192
Always determining the one truth

6
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:11,852
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

7
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:14,293
his name is Detective Conan!

8
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,022
(During the next full moon once again on Moonshade Island)

9
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:36,337
(the shadows will begin to vanish)

10
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,403
(Please investigate the case. Aso Keiji)

11
00:01:56,253 --> 00:02:00,423
"The Moonlight Sonata Murder, Part One!"

12
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:02,493
Moonshade Island Village Office

13
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:06,407
There isn't anyone by that name on this island.

14
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:09,698
What? Can't you search your records more thoroughly?

15
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:13,787
I have a letter from him requesting my services right here.

16
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:18,347
But he's not on the island's resident list.

17
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:21,767
And besides, I just arrived on this island last month.

18
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,297
Hey, what's going on here?

19
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:24,708
Well, actually...

20
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:30,677
This man claims to have been hired by a resident of the island.

21
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:31,668
Hired?

22
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,407
Yes, by somebody named Aso Keiji-san.

23
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:37,128
Did you say Aso Keiji?!

24
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,387
That's not possible.

25
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,018
What?

26
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:50,388
After all, he passed away more than ten years ago.

27
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:57,398
It happened 12 years ago on the night of a full moon.

28
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,918
He was a famous pianist from this island.

29
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:05,527
After performing a concert at the village's community center,

30
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:08,788
he suddenly locked himself and his family inside his home

31
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:12,028
and set the house on fire.

32
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,927
According to the rescuers who arrived at the scene,

33
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,897
after brutally murdering his wife and daughter with a knife,

34
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:26,428
he played the same piece over and over amidst the flames like a man possessed.

35
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:30,788
It was Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."

36
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:39,327
Jeez. What an awful prank.

37
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,107
It might not be a prank.

38
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:41,818
What?

39
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:45,257
After all, you received your retainer fee, right?

40
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,018
Yeah.

41
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:50,697
And the postmark on the letter is from Moonshade Island.

42
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:51,827
You're right.

43
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:59,077
Which means someone on this island probably wants you to investigate that Aso Keiji person.

44
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,527
I see.

45
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:04,728
But if the man in question is dead, then...

46
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:11,107
Let's try talking to the mayor who was allegedly Aso-san's friend.

47
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,527
You're right.

48
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:14,703
I believe they said the mayor is at the community center.

49
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,497
Are you listening, Kenta-kun?

50
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,997
Make sure you keep yourself warm while you sleep.

51
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:19,488
Okay.

52
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,137
Bye, Doctor Narumi.

53
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:23,687
Bye.

54
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,647
Excuse me.

55
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,238
Yes?

56
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:29,517
Do you know where the community center is?

57
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:35,607
Take a right at that corner, and the community center is at the end of the street.

58
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,977
Did you come here from the mainland?

59
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,047
Yes. We're from Tokyo.

60
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:43,567
Really?! My family's from Tokyo, too.

61
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,477
Oh, really?

62
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,267
But unlike Tokyo, isn't this island wonderful?

63
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:52,374
The air is clear, and it's so quiet here.

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,477
In order to protect the island's fishing grounds,

65
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,007
vote for me, Shimizu Masato!

66
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:58,908
Vote for Shimizu Masato!

67
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:05,997
Normally the island is quiet, but the mayoral election is coming up.

68
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,467
Mayoral election?

69
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,198
Yes.

70
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,688
There are three candidates.

71
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:16,687
According to my patients, it's likely that Kawashima-san will be elected.

72
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:20,968
Actually, Miss Nurse, we're not particularly interested in the mayoral election.

73
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,817
I'm Asai Narumi, a doctor.

74
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,827
I have a medical license.

75
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:28,898
Excuse me. You're a doctor, huh?

76
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,657
If you're going to the community center,

77
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:36,058
you might get to meet the three men I just mentioned.

78
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,797
After all, the previous mayor Kameyama Isamu-san's

79
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,388
second anniversary memorial service is being held there tonight.

80
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:50,438
Don't let Mayor Kuroiwa get away with this tyranny!

81
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:53,467
Stop polluting our fishing grounds!

82
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:54,828
Unbelievable.

83
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,297
The previous mayor's memorial service is tonight.

84
00:05:58,298 --> 00:05:59,777
How rude of them.

85
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:00,718
Indeed.

86
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,808
They're so noisy.

87
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:04,088
Hirata.

88
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,197
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,727
What are you doing?

90
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:09,257
Hurry up and shut up those villagers.

91
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:11,588
As you wish, miss.

92
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:16,007
Whoa, whoa. Are you guys okay?

93
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,978
Shuichi.

94
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:24,587
According to the villagers, the odds are against your dad in the upcoming mayoral race.

95
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,077
That's not—

96
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,488
That's right.

97
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:32,368
It seems that I have the most support from the villagers.

98
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,468
That's because you know how to use your money.

99
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,517
I'm just copying your methods.

100
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:44,388
There's somebody who says he'd like to meet with the mayor.

101
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,127
What? Who wants to see me now?

102
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:51,697
H-He says he's a detective from Tokyo.

103
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:52,608
Jeez.

104
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,277
How long are they going to make us wait?

105
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,537
Maybe they're busy preparing for the memorial service.

106
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:58,748
Right, Conan-kun?

107
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,348
Conan-kun?

108
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:04,468
A piano.

109
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,568
Hey, Conan-kun.

110
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,478
What is it, Ran?

111
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,078
This is a big room.

112
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:14,928
Are they going to hold a piano concert?

113
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,208
The ocean is right behind the building.

114
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:22,917
This piano looks pretty old.

115
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:24,277
I wonder if it works.

116
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,128
Don't!

117
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,378
Don't touch that piano!

118
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:35,258
That's the cursed piano played here at the concert the day Aso-san died.

119
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:38,018
Surely it's not cursed.

120
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,817
That incident wasn't the only thing that happened.

121
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:43,788
Something similar happened to the previous mayor.

122
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:48,768
You mean Kameyama Isamu-san, whose memorial service is being held today?

123
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:52,027
Yes. It happened two years ago.

124
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:56,798
The moon was full that night, just like the night of Aso-san's incident.

125
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:03,397
I happened to pass nearby when I heard the sound of the piano

126
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,808
coming from the supposedly empty community center.

127
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:10,298
I thought someone was there, so I called out to them, and the sound abruptly stopped.

128
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,728
When I entered the room...

129
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:18,128
Kameyama-san was leaning against the keys, dead.

130
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,038
The cause of death was a heart attack.

131
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,807
And horrifyingly, the piece that had been playing right up until his death

132
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:32,388
was the piece Aso-san played amidst the inferno, the "Moonlight Sonata."

133
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:40,237
Since then, people started calling this the cursed piano.

134
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,578
The villagers are too afraid to touch it.

135
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,518
There's nothing special about this piano.

136
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,098
Conan-kun!

137
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,937
In any case, please wait outside until the service is over.

138
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,877
Oh, it's you guys.

139
00:08:58,878 --> 00:08:59,848
Narumi-san.

140
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,658
Were you able to meet with the mayor?

141
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,987
No, not yet.

142
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,987
Are you here for the service, Narumi-san?

143
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:07,868
Yes.

144
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:13,328
Kameyama-san's was the first body I examined after coming to the island.

145
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:15,888
I thought I could at least light some incense.

146
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:20,488
Oh, right. This is one of the mayoral candidates I mentioned earlier.

147
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,448
Nice to meet you. I'm Shimizu Masato.

148
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:24,938
A pleasure.

149
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,718
Nishimoto Ken (55) Unemployed

150
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:44,118
Bastard.

151
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:48,828
You hired a detective to investigate me, didn't you?

152
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,597
Don't be ridiculous.

153
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:53,348
Hey, are you running away from me?

154
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,328
I'm going to the bathroom.

155
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,538
It doesn't make sense.

156
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:09,328
Supposedly no one's used that piano in years, but it was in tune.

157
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:13,148
Someone's probably been tuning it in secret.

158
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:16,838
And then there's that letter that arrived one week ago...

159
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,478
Th-This song...

160
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:27,848
The "Moonlight Sonata!"

161
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,028
Crap!

162
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:29,728
Conan-kun?

163
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,558
Damn it! We were too late!

164
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,883
It's no use. He's dead.

165
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,383
Kawashima-san is dead?

166
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,773
What's going on?

167
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,983
Ran, call the police substation.

168
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:54,764
Got it.

169
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:58,394
Everyone else, stay where you are.

170
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,043
Doctor Narumi.

171
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,154
Yes?

172
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,434
Could you examine the body?

173
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,864
Very well.

174
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,214
I see. So that's how it is.

175
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:16,043
This is what that letter was warning us about.

176
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:19,724
Damn it! If only I'd realized what it meant sooner.

177
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:21,854
I-It's the curse.

178
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:24,933
It's the piano's curse!

179
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,444
This isn't a curse.

180
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,884
Look closely.

181
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:33,274
It's not a curse or a ghost that's playing the piano.

182
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,664
It's this tape recorder.

183
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:46,404
In other words, this is a murder case made to look like the previous two incidents.

184
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,534
Oh, come on. Don't go making up stories.

185
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:54,354
Who are you, anyway?

186
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:58,044
Me? I came here from Tokyo.

187
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,054
I'm the great detective Mori Kogoro.

188
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,273
Ever heard of him?

189
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:06,294
No...

190
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,274
Seawater?

191
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,703
Judging by the body's condition,

192
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:25,323
the estimated time of death is 30 minutes to one hour ago.

193
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:27,583
The cause of death is suffocation.

194
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:30,693
I believe he was drowned.

195
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,994
He was drowned?

196
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,803
I can't say for certain without performing an autopsy.

197
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:39,304
I think Doctor Narumi is right.

198
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:42,254
Look outside the window.

199
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:45,224
Isn't that Kawashima-san's jacket?

200
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:50,443
It looks like something was dragged from the door leading out to the sea to the piano,

201
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:53,844
and there's mud and sand on Kawashima-san's back.

202
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:59,984
Also, the room's doors and windows are locked,

203
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:05,724
and the first few minutes of this "Moonlight Sonata" tape are blank.

204
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:11,633
During the service, the culprit probably brought Kawashima-san to the ocean and drowned him,

205
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:14,563
moved the body into this room, locked the doors and windows,

206
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:17,814
turned on the tape recorder, and then left the room.

207
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:24,384
After several minutes of silence, the "Moonlight Sonata" started playing on the tape recorder.

208
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,453
Right, Mister?

209
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:28,774
Y-Yeah, that's right.

210
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:36,133
But since we were in the entryway of the community center the whole time...

211
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:40,074
W-Wait a minute. Does that mean the culprit is still...

212
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:43,274
in this room?

213
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:49,313
Yeah, as long as they didn't use the confusion to escape.

214
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:50,834
Hey, Mister Detective.

215
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:56,983
I wouldn't call it a motive, but the man happiest about Kawashima's death

216
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:02,703
is probably the other mayoral candidate, Shimizu-kun.

217
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,173
W-What did you say?

218
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:07,473
I could say the same thing about you, Mayor Kuroiwa.

219
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:08,464
What was that?

220
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,744
Now, now. Try to calm down.

221
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,714
By the way, how long as that piano been here?

222
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:20,833
It was given to the community center as a gift from Aso-san 15 years ago.

223
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,023
It's been here ever since.

224
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:24,703
From Aso-san?

225
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:29,494
Yes. Aso-san's name is even on the lid.

226
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,684
What's this?

227
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:34,184
Sheet music?

228
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:42,784
That's odd. This wasn't here when we looked at it this afternoon.

229
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:48,203
Who was that?

230
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,323
Nishimoto Ken-san.

231
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,414
Nishimoto?

232
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:55,253
He was quite prosperous a long time ago,

233
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,313
but after the previous mayor passed away two years ago,

234
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,944
he began shutting himself inside his home.

235
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:03,983
Since the incident two years ago, huh?

236
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:09,444
Oh, right. I believe that Mayor Kuroiwa and he are childhood friends, right?

237
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:12,434
Yeah, I think so.

238
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,084
Dad.

239
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:19,074
I brought a police officer.

240
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:21,223
Took you long enough, Ran.

241
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:22,993
Yeah, but...

242
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:26,493
Uh, who called for me?

243
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:29,604
This man. His name is Mori Kogoro-san.

244
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,154
Who are you?

245
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:37,463
In any case, it's already late.

246
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:40,164
We'll interview the witnesses tomorrow.

247
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:47,354
Damn it. This case is full of unknowns.

248
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:52,254
Why did the culprit bother to move the body to the piano?

249
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:57,164
Does this sheet music that was found with the body mean anything?

250
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:01,864
And what about the letter warning us about this case?

251
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,493
Wait a minute.

252
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:08,254
I think that letter said "begin to vanish."

253
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,714
Could it be that this case is...?

254
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,213
What?!

255
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:17,214
This letter warned us about this case?

256
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:22,673
Yeah. "The shadows will vanish" means they'll be enveloped in light.

257
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:25,323
That light is the moon's light.

258
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:26,654
It's referring to the "Moonlight Sonata."

259
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:30,353
That's it. Both 12 years ago and two years ago,

260
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:35,194
the "Moonlight Sonata" was playing right up until Aso-san and Kameyama-san died.

261
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:38,943
In other words, if the shadows will vanish again,

262
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:43,323
that means the "Moonlight Sonata" will be played again, and somebody else will die.

263
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:44,784
Wait a minute.

264
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,304
This letter says that the shadows will "begin to vanish."

265
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:53,674
Does that mean there's more to this case?

266
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,194
Sheesh.

267
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:05,044
If you ask me, spending the night here with the body is insanity.

268
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:07,324
Well, you know...

269
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:11,563
More importantly, who moved the body?

270
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,483
That was me.

271
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:17,643
I felt bad about leaving him in that position.

272
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,393
You shouldn't have done that.

273
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,663
The crime scene hasn't been properly examined yet.

274
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:22,854
Huh?

275
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,254
That sheet music is missing.

276
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,703
What?

277
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:31,343
Oh, I thought I'd hold onto it for safekeeping.

278
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,174
Here.

279
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:36,523
Huh? This is the sheet music for the "Moonlight Sonata."

280
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,764
Th-The "Moonlight Sonata"?

281
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:43,043
But the fourth line is sort of weird.

282
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:44,314
The fourth line?

283
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,543
Weird how?

284
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:47,944
Ready?

285
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,884
When you play the fourth line...

286
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,184
See?

287
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:03,164
Could the fourth line of this sheet music be a dying message from Kawashima-san?

288
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:08,714
Which means it's possible that the culprit will return to retrieve this.

289
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,713
Doctor Narumi?

290
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:17,753
I called your inn, and they said you'd be here.

291
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,223
I brought you dinner.

292
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,294
N-Now that you mention it...

293
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,464
Really?

294
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:30,423
So you're not originally from this island, Doctor Narumi?

295
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:34,224
No. I go back to Tokyo every weekend.

296
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,473
It's been two years since I started coming here.

297
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,173
Speaking of two years,

298
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,854
I have a question about Mayor Kameyama who died two years ago.

299
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:48,094
He'd previously had heart problems, and the cause of death was a heart attack.

300
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,754
But his face was rather tense,

301
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,504
as though he'd seen something terrifying.

302
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:59,424
He looked like he'd seen something terrifying, huh?

303
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:06,503
In any case, I'll keep watch tonight.

304
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:08,483
You guys should go to sleep.

305
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:09,704
Okay.

306
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:16,433
Hey, Mori-kun. Mori-kun.

307
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,264
It's almost noon. Wake up.

308
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:23,273
I-Inspector Megure, what are you doing here?

309
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:26,544
Are you sure you're not still asleep?

310
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:31,903
I heard you were involved, so I came all the way here.

311
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,373
Th-That's right.

312
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:35,993
Inspector, I have something for you.

313
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:38,683
Conan-kun already gave me the sheet music.

314
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:39,324
What?

315
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:44,164
The three of them outlined the case for me, too.

316
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:48,603
All three of them were awake by the time we arrived.

317
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,194
What?

318
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:54,993
In any case, we're interviewing people at the village office.

319
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,423
Come lend us a hand.

320
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:57,944
Yes, sir.

321
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:09,253
Well? Did you figured out who did it?

322
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:10,733
Don't be stupid.

323
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,823
We've got 38 witnesses to question.

324
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,743
When will I be questioned?

325
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,213
I'm sure you're exhausted.

326
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:20,353
I asked them to question you last.

327
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:23,894
In that case, I'll go wash my face first.

328
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:25,134
Hey.

329
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,223
How many more people do you have to question?

330
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:33,964
Six total. There's Doctor Narumi, those four over there,

331
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,474
and Nishimoto, who's being questioned right now.

332
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,844
You fool!

333
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,233
Cursed piano, my ass.

334
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:45,463
This happened because that thing is still here.

335
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,074
B-But sir...

336
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:49,934
Get rid of it immediately. Got it?

337
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,894
V-Very well.

338
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:00,363
Enough already!

339
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:04,373
I obviously don't have a motive to kill Kawashima-san!

340
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:05,522
I told you, we're just questioning everyone.

341
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:09,133
Wow. Reiko-san has been yelling for ten minutes.

342
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,244
You can't be serious!

343
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,392
That's odd.

344
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,724
They've been interviewed already, so why aren't they leaving?

345
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:18,014
I'm going to the bathroom!

346
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:21,344
He's not here!

347
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,393
Hey, did Nishimoto-san go in there?

348
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,684
No. Only Shimizu is inside.

349
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,594
Damn it. He must be upstairs.

350
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:30,714
Crap!

351
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:32,754
This song...

352
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,063
It's the second movement of the "Moonlight Sonata."

353
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,214
Where's the source of the sound?!

354
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:40,784
The broadcast room?

355
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,134
Nishimoto-san!

356
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,264
Mayor Kuroiwa.

357
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:51,023
Call forensics and the coroner immediately.

358
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:56,023
But Inspector, the coroner left for Tokyo to perform Kawashima's autopsy.

359
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,483
Damn it. Why did this have to happen now?

360
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,314
Excuse me.

361
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,353
If you don't mind, I could do it.

362
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,774
Doctor Narumi.

363
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,813
Thank you.

364
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:08,683
In that case, until the forensics team arrives, could you examine him right away?

365
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:09,454
Yes.

366
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:14,404
Again. I knew it was coming, but I let another person die.

367
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:16,373
It's unforgivable.

368
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:20,274
Threatening to commit murder and then calmly carrying out that threat...

369
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,364
They won't get away with this!

370
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:47,613
Th-The hellfire's grudge? Could it be?

371
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:48,754
It's him.

372
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:51,454
Aso Keiji is alive!

373
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:57,854
Murasawa-san?

374
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,914
N-Nishimoto-san...

375
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,994
What is this? Could it be?

376
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:14,544
The next episode of Conan is "The Moonlight Sonata Murder, Part Two!"
