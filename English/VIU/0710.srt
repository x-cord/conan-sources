1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:02,906
Huh?

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,706
Hattori and Kazuha.

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,806
What do you mean by Kudo?

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:10,806
Huh?

5
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:13,306
You said that name just now, didn't you?

6
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,006
"We've got a case, Kudo!"

7
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,206
I meant, "You all got a case to go to."

8
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:21,606
Things will end up becoming lively.

9
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:22,906
It's a homicide,

10
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,506
and yet what an inappropriate thing to say.

11
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:26,106
A homicide?

12
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:28,006
Don't tell me you came all the way from Osaka

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,106
to discuss a case that happened there?

14
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,506
No, no!

15
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,406
It happened here in Tokyo,

16
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:36,906
and the witness is Mr. Otaki, here.

17
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,406
Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

18
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,906
Hi there, long time no see!

19
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,506
The case titled "Locked Room Murder

20
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:46,606
Where the Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

21
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:47,806
Right?

22
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,706
Yeah, I suppose.

23
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:54,306
What's that supposed to be?

24
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,406
Aim for a 100% solution.

25
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:00,006
Clear all mysteries and codes.

26
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:02,006
The mysterious murder that occurred in the elevator.

27
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,206
It's a deduction battle between Hattori and me.

28
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:05,806
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:07,706
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:10,606
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:56,114
"Everyone Was Watching (Part 1)"

32
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,646
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -What?

33
00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:59,746
The man who was under police surveillance

34
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,746
was killed without anyone noticing?

35
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,046
Yes. Last month a man in his 70's

36
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:08,746
died in his condo in Haido-cho.

37
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:12,446
The man who died called Hidemichi Mizuki,

38
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,646
used to be a high school teacher until a few years ago.

39
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,546
He taught a student

40
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,946
by the name of Kiriya Hido back then.

41
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:22,046
Kiriya Hido.

42
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,946
That name sounds familiar.

43
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:27,646
He's a serial killer who killed two people in Osaka

44
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,246
and one person in Kobe,

45
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,846
and was on the run.

46
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,446
We received intel that he was seen in Tokyo,

47
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:35,946
so we were working together with the MPD

48
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,946
and staking out Mr. Mizuki's condo.

49
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,346
If there was anywhere that Hido,

50
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,146
who has no family around would rely on,

51
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,846
we thought that he would go to Mr. Mizuki's place

52
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:46,746
because he helped Hido look for a job and etc.

53
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,546
And on the third day in the morning

54
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:50,246
after staking out,

55
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,346
although it was time for him to come out

56
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,346
to go on his usual walk, he didn't so.

57
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:55,546
I thought something was wrong

58
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,846
and went to check out his room.

59
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,146
I found Mr. Mizuki dead after hanging himself

60
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,746
from a rope passed through

61
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:05,646
the ventilation hole of the air conditioner.

62
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,846
Then, didn't he commit suicide?

63
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:12,046
Of course you were keeping an eye on the window

64
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,546
and entrance of his room too. Weren't you?

65
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,146
Yes. That's why the case

66
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:18,446
was closed once as a suicide case

67
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,546
but the position of the toes of the suicide victim

68
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,546
was strangely very high.

69
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:26,146
That is, it was slightly under my crotch.

70
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,146
And surprisingly,

71
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:28,746
the chair that was knocked over

72
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,446
by the feet of the victim...

73
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:34,246
Was the same as the one in my kitchen!

74
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,146
That chair was a vintage produced in limited number

75
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,446
and they were all of the same size.

76
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,046
I measured it together with Mr. Otaki

77
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,346
and found that from the toes of the dead body

78
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:45,846
to the seat of the chair

79
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:49,146
there was a space of more than 10cm!

80
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,146
Hey, hey,

81
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,946
if there was a space of more than 10cm,

82
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:54,346
then he wouldn't reach it even if he stood on his tiptoes!

83
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,546
Yeah.

84
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,146
In other words...

85
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,546
That chair was a prop

86
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,546
that the culprit deliberately put there

87
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:05,446
to make it look as if Mr. Mizuki had committed suicide!

88
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:07,246
I see. That's why,

89
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:10,446
"The Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

90
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:13,946
It seems that the room was not locked,

91
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,146
so it was most likely homicide.

92
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:20,446
It can't be that the killer called Kiriya Hido.

93
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,246
Wrong.

94
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:26,246
Kiriya Hido was arrested in Hiroshima

95
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,546
but, it seems he was spending the nights all this month

96
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,246
at an Internet Cafe.

97
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,646
But, the police had their eyes on him, didn't they?

98
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:37,946
How did he go in and out?

99
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:38,946
Right.

100
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:42,446
This is a case of circumstantial locked room murder.

101
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,446
We got permission from the bereaved family of the victim,

102
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:47,446
and are headed towards his condo from now.

103
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:50,046
And, you folks want to come along too, don't you?

104
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:55,546
And, is it true that

105
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:58,346
the crime scene is still left as is?

106
00:05:58,346 --> 00:05:59,446
Yes.

107
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,946
The daughter of the victim said that she'd be coming

108
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,246
to get his belongings tomorrow, though.

109
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,546
Well, I guess there'd be no problem if we solved

110
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,846
the locked room murder case by today, right?

111
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,346
Look, look, Ran!

112
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:12,346
This elevator has a window!

113
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,646
There're quite a lot of them around! Those with windows on them.

114
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,546
Keep the noise down!

115
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,646
We aren't going on a play trip, you know!

116
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,346
I know!

117
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,346
I've got an important mission

118
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:26,646
that only I can carry out, you know!

119
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,946
An important mission?

120
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:33,846
No doubt about it!

121
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,146
This chair is the same as the one in my house!

122
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,246
Even the wood and the color are exactly the same!

123
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:40,546
Don't you think there's something strange

124
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,846
about this case after all, Heiji?

125
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,246
I've been telling you that to begin with.

126
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:47,646
Mission completed!

127
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:51,546
I mean she didn't have to come all this way.

128
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:54,746
All she had to do was measure the height of the chair.

129
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:55,946
So, now, the question is,

130
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,746
how did the culprit go in and out of this room

131
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,646
under strict police surveillance?

132
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:04,546
Maybe there's a secret path somewhere?

133
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,746
Just as Inspector Otaki said,

134
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,646
the rope was passed through the ventilation hole

135
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,246
of the air conditioner.

136
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:13,546
Huh? There's something on the ground right below the rope.

137
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:16,746
Shaved pencil debris?

138
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,846
It seems that the inhabitant of this room

139
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:23,046
favored using pencils.

140
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,846
But, why would something like that be clumped up

141
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,046
and left on the floor like this?

142
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,146
From the looks of this room,

143
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:32,146
it seems that the inhabitant was pretty tidy

144
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:35,146
to the point of having a cleaning robot, and yet...

145
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,346
And the cylinder type trash can that

146
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:40,046
is knocked over in the corner of the room.

147
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:43,246
A tidy inhabitant would never leave something like that as is.

148
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:48,846
Hey, Hattori, don't tell me that this is...

149
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:52,046
Yeah. I guess the answer is this.

150
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,846
Hey, Heiji?

151
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,746
Just what're you doing? Moving something like that around.

152
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,846
Solving a mystery.

153
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,846
Huh?

154
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,246
When Mr. Mizuki hung himself,

155
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:06,746
he didn't use that chair as a foot stool.

156
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,946
He used this elongated trash box.

157
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,746
What?

158
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:13,846
He probably had this right under the rope.

159
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:15,146
He stood it upside down

160
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,446
so that he could easily climb on it.

161
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,846
As proof of it, pencil shavings

162
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:22,646
were found clumped up around here.

163
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,546
When he turned the trash box upside down, the shavings

164
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:28,546
that were stuck at the bottom of the trash box fell out.

165
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,646
See?

166
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:31,446
This is higher than the chair

167
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,046
and his feet would reach too, right?

168
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,846
But, Heiji.

169
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:38,346
When we came in, there was no such thing.

170
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,546
No problem.

171
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,946
When he hung himself, if he kicks the trash box over

172
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:48,346
so that it is caught between the legs of the chair.

173
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,846
All that needed to be done, was for the cleaning robot

174
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,046
to push the trash can over to the corner of the room.

175
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:58,746
Then, return to its original battery charging base.

176
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,346
This way, this strange situation

177
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,946
of the man being hung is completed!

178
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,646
The evidence is that

179
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:07,546
the robot only cleans this route.

180
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,946
I'm sure that the robot was probably made to

181
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,346
memorize this route

182
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:14,546
by putting obstacles in place as needed.

183
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,346
Hey, hold it.

184
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:17,946
Then, this case...

185
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:20,746
Yeah. No matter how you look at it...

186
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,846
It's a suicide.

187
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:27,346
Heiji.

188
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:28,846
Are you okay?

189
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:32,546
Too bad there was no chance to pitch in.

190
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:35,846
But, why did Mr. Mizuki decide to die like that?

191
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,946
Mr. Mizuki goofed at stocks

192
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,446
and seems to have been in great debt.

193
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,846
And, it seemed he really hated that stock broker

194
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:45,446
who caused him to end up that way.

195
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:48,146
He seems to have said when he was drunk

196
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,446
that he would go to hell together with that guy.

197
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:54,546
That's why he wanted to make it look

198
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:56,546
as if that broker killed him, maybe.

199
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:57,646
But, unfortunately,

200
00:09:57,646 --> 00:10:00,446
because he was under police surveillance,

201
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,546
it was concluded without a doubt

202
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:05,746
that he committed suicide.

203
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,346
By the way, does that broker

204
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:09,546
live in this neighborhood?

205
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:10,846
Neighborhood's not the word.

206
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,746
It seems that he moved over there last year.

207
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,346
If I remember correctly, his name is...

208
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,946
Mr. Fuura who lives on the 2nd floor, right?

209
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:21,746
Everybody in this condo finds him to be a nuisance!

210
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,746
-Huh? -He talks about stocks with people

211
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:27,246
who are waiting for the elevator.

212
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,746
At first you make a little profit but,

213
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,446
the minute you let him take care of a large sum,

214
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:33,346
you lose a large amount.

215
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,646
Even my husband almost fell for it,

216
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:38,046
and it was tough trying to stop him from doing so.

217
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,746
Oh, is that so?

218
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:43,046
He was really like Death

219
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,646
and his face looked just like Death too!

220
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,546
His had hollow eyes and cheeks.

221
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,546
His complexion was pale.

222
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,046
Oh. Talk of the devil.

223
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:56,346
-Wh... -What?

224
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,528
Darn! It went up!

225
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,528
Mr. Otaki, where's the stairs?

226
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,528
I think it was...

227
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:11,128
You should know since you live here, don't you?

228
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:14,428
Never mind! I'll look for it myself!

229
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:15,728
Hold it!

230
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:16,928
It's come down.

231
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:17,928
What?

232
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,728
What? You were investigating a case

233
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:43,128
that was closed as a suicide case?

234
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:46,228
Yes. There was something that bothered me a bit, you see.

235
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,428
I took a break and came over from Osaka.

236
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,428
After investigating,

237
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:53,528
it was concluded to be a suicide case after all.

238
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,128
Just as I was about to leave

239
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:57,028
on the elevator along with Mr. Mouri and the others

240
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:59,628
who came along with me to help me.

241
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:02,728
I ran into this site.

242
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:05,128
I see.

243
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,028
The deceased is Mr. Kaizo Fuura

244
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:10,628
who lives on the 2nd floor of this condo.

245
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:13,728
He seems to have been a stock broker.

246
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,628
Correct, isn't it?

247
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:17,228
Yes, sir.

248
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,428
Who is she?

249
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,928
She was trying to go downstairs

250
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,628
and rode the elevator with us.

251
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:26,628
Her name is Nanami and she lives on the 3rd floor.

252
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:30,628
It seems she goes to an esthetic salon every week at this time.

253
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,128
In other words, when the door of the elevator opened,

254
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,528
this is what you saw.

255
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,828
Wrong, Mr. Takagi.

256
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:39,028
From the window of the elevator that came from below,

257
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:42,328
we saw Mr. Fuura riding the elevator.

258
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,228
He shot himself in the temple with a gun.

259
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:51,428
It was just as if he wanted to show us what he was doing.

260
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:54,828
Which means that the elevator went up as is?

261
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,428
Yeah. I was going to confirm

262
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,528
where he was getting off so I went up the stairs but...

263
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,828
this elevator came down right away

264
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,928
and when the door opened...

265
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:07,128
This is what we saw.

266
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,528
Then, this is undoubtedly a suicide, no?

267
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:13,428
Yes. There's this message here too, you see.

268
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,428
Good...

269
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:20,028
Goodbye?

270
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:23,228
There's a spray can by the feet of the corpse,

271
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,328
rolling on the floor, see?

272
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,928
I think he used it to write what he did

273
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,828
just before he died.

274
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,228
A will, I guess.

275
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,528
That's why, no matter how you try looking at this,

276
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:34,528
it's definitely...

277
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:35,928
A murder.

278
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,928
Huh?

279
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,628
I'm telling you that no matter

280
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:42,528
how you look at it, this is murder!

281
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,728
You mean this is a murder case?

282
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:45,728
Yeah.

283
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:48,028
Don't say something so irresponsible!

284
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,328
The case that you claimed to be a homicide

285
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,828
turned out to be a suicide case after all too, you know!

286
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:54,428
Take a good look at the surveillance camera

287
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:57,728
set up above the floor indicator of the elevator then.

288
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,328
It's covered with spray paint, isn't it?

289
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:03,328
True.

290
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:06,028
That's why I called the manager of this condo

291
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,728
and confirmed.

292
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,728
Then, I was told that a hand holding the spray can

293
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:13,328
suddenly appeared on the monitor and sprayed the camera.

294
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,028
Since the culprit

295
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,628
didn't want to be in view of the camera,

296
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:21,328
he stretched over his hand to cover it with spray.

297
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,328
But, maybe he just didn't want the camera

298
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,328
recording the suicide.

299
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:30,428
It was clearly on the recorded image.

300
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,828
The right hand of someone holding the spray can!

301
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,928
I'm sure it was the right hand.

302
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,928
Most Japanese people are right handed after all, you see.

303
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,128
Hold it there!

304
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:45,028
This man is holding the gun in his left hand.

305
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,128
Maybe he's left handed?

306
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:50,528
Everybody knows that Mr. Fuura is left handed.

307
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:54,328
I see! His left hand was holding the gun so...

308
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,428
Then, do you mean that he went out of his way

309
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,128
to hold the can in his right hand to write the word?

310
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:02,728
Besides, the wristwatch that he's wearing.

311
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,928
It's not unusual for a left-handed person

312
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:08,328
to be wearing his wristwatch on his left wrist.

313
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,728
No. It's stopped.

314
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:13,728
At the time when we found the corpse.

315
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:15,328
Then, maybe it ran out of battery

316
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,728
or broke when he fell.

317
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:21,328
But this wristwatch...

318
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:22,928
winds automatically!

319
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,628
It winds itself automatically

320
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:27,228
when the person wearing it moves, right?

321
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,828
See! It moves when it's shaken.

322
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,628
Isn't it strange?

323
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:33,128
True.

324
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,628
That's probably because...

325
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:37,128
The one who wanted to kill Mr. Fuura

326
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:39,328
deliberately made him wear the wristwatch

327
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:43,128
right after committing the crime.

328
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:45,128
I don't know why yet, though.

329
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:46,828
But the fact that, that someone

330
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:51,128
is still somewhere here above the 3rd floor is what I do know.

331
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:52,928
After finding the corpse, I called

332
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,628
the manager's room on the 1st floor right away

333
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,928
and had them guard the stairs, you see.

334
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,628
Until you people from the police came,

335
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:02,228
there's no one who used the stairs to come down, you see!

336
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,428
Would you like me to go check each and every room?

337
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,028
Yes.

338
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,828
Then, let 's start from the 4th floor right above.

339
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,428
Three rooms?

340
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,528
There were only three suspicious rooms?

341
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:16,928
This building is a seven story building

342
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:20,128
and there are many rooms above the 3rd floor and yet...

343
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:23,228
Yes. Because of the suicide last month,

344
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:25,828
there seems to have been many people who moved out.

345
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,528
At any rate, the only ones who live alone

346
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,228
and had no alibi were the inhabitants of these three rooms.

347
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:37,928
If so, let's go hear the story of those three people once again.

348
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,128
I don't think that the person would think

349
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:42,828
it possible that he would be suspected so soon too.

350
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:46,328
No good. Heiji's switch is turned on.

351
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,228
What shall I do, when it's almost time for the bullet train

352
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,728
we're taking back home is going to depart.

353
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,928
I guess you'll just have to sleep over at our place.

354
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,928
Murder?

355
00:16:57,928 --> 00:17:01,028
Didn't Mr. Fuura commit suicide?

356
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:04,828
No. The fact that he may have been murdered also emerged.

357
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,328
But, why do you know about this?

358
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:12,728
Because Nanami twitted on the internet that.

359
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:17,228
"'Death' committed suicide in the elevator of our condo."

360
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:19,828
"Death" refers to Mr. Fuura, the nickname

361
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:23,028
that Nanami gave him.

362
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:26,228
That lady was twittering when she was working her cell phone

363
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,328
without saying a word.

364
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,528
I hope you don't mind me stepping in a bit.

365
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:34,028
No.

366
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:35,928
I don't mind.

367
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,928
By the way, what do you do for a living?

368
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,928
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

369
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,228
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

370
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:47,828
I also handle air conditioners.

371
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:50,128
Which means you also handle

372
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,428
elevator and security maintenance?

373
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:54,428
Yes. Sort of.

374
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:57,528
By the way, who are those young men?

375
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:00,628
Please don't let them bother you.

376
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:01,928
By the way, you.

377
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:05,228
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

378
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:09,128
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

379
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:11,828
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

380
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:15,228
Which means that you lost out on stocks

381
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,428
because of Mr. Fuura, and hated him too?

382
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,028
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

383
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,928
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

384
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,328
Please stick your hands forward, then.

385
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:25,728
Hands?

386
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,328
Don't tell me that you're arresting me just like that?

387
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,128
No.

388
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,628
We're just checking to see

389
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,828
if there are any discharge residue

390
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:39,228
on your hands and sleeves after a gun is fired.

391
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:42,228
Since the forensic officers are here too.

392
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:46,328
It's true that I lost out too,

393
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:49,528
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

394
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,428
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

395
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,528
Because it's my fault too for not being able to read

396
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,828
the direction of where the stocks were headed for, you see.

397
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:01,428
This room smells of thinner.

398
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,128
That's because I was coloring

399
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,028
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

400
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:07,328
Freshly severed necks?

401
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:12,028
They're making a splatter movie at my university,

402
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,828
and that's what they're going to be used for!

403
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:16,828
It's really well made, though.

404
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:18,828
They look real.

405
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,728
I'm sure that Ran would faint if she saw them.

406
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,428
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

407
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:28,328
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

408
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,528
A freshly made severed neck

409
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,928
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

410
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:34,128
Then, do you also take scenes of people

411
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:36,128
are shot successively with guns?

412
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,228
Not much of that.

413
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,928
I usually take movies of people being stabbed,

414
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,628
slashed or chopped up.

415
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:44,628
Do you have it too?

416
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,828
The same wristwatch as Mr. Fuura?

417
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:49,728
Yeah. I got it as a gift from Mr. Fuura

418
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,128
when I made out on the first stocks I bought.

419
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,028
Mr. Mutsu that we talked to a while ago

420
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,228
was also wearing the same wristwatch.

421
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,628
Well, it seems that yours is moving like it should be, though.

422
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:01,928
I usually wear it, you see.

423
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:03,428
Although I'm not wearing it now

424
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:05,128
to keep from getting paint on it.

425
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,328
Then, please show me your hands

426
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,228
so I can check for discharge residue.

427
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:13,128
Okay, but I was painting, you know.

428
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,228
So, it's like this.

429
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,728
Yes. If it's that wristwatch,

430
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,528
I also got it from Mr. Fuura.

431
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:24,528
In celebration of profiting from stocks.

432
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:26,728
I just wore it once and put it in my drawer,

433
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,328
never to take it out again.

434
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:33,028
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

435
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:36,228
Can't you tell by looking?

436
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,528
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

437
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,228
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

438
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:43,328
calligraphy paint and ink.

439
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:44,828
I'm a cartoonist!

440
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,028
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

441
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,328
You're the author of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

442
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:53,028
that Chiba is hooked on.

443
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,928
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

444
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,528
to come up with a story to make it look

445
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:00,728
as if someone committed suicide in the elevator

446
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,828
by using a gun, and kill him.

447
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,528
If I came up with such an amusing story,

448
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,528
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

449
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:13,428
It's too wasteful to use such a story on a guy like him.

450
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:16,728
How come you have four tracing tables?

451
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:19,228
Three are for my assistants.

452
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:20,628
They left after finishing what they had to do

453
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:21,928
this morning, though.

454
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,228
I always thought that the room of a cartoonist

455
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:26,228
would be full of books,

456
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:28,228
but you don't have too many.

457
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:32,028
You can say that again. There are only a few comic books lined out.

458
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:35,328
Just what age are you talking about anyway?

459
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,828
Don't put me in the same categories as cartoonists

460
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,828
in the past, mind you?

461
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:44,428
I would like to check your hands for now.

462
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:47,928
I don't mind.

463
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:50,028
Too bad I disappointed you.

464
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:53,028
As you can see, I just finished taking a bath.

465
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:57,028
The discharge residue would've washed off already.

466
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:00,728
Mr. Mouri, did you come up with something?

467
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:02,728
No, not at all.

468
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,728
All three of them seem suspicious

469
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,628
and on the other hand, not.

470
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:09,028
No. The culprit is probably

471
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,028
that person who was hiding that thing.

472
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,628
The question is the trick.

473
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:20,028
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

474
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,228
Well, you two are full-fledged only

475
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,528
when you work together too, so...

476
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:46,728
Hold it right there!

477
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:47,728
Just what do you mean that we're full-fledged only

478
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,028
when we work together?

479
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,628
Wait a sec. If that is used...

480
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:54,628
Yeah, the word 'Goodbye'...

481
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:58,028
It's not a mere will made to look like a message.

482
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:00,028
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

483
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:01,428
Bang!

484
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:11,428
Next Conan, "Everyone was Watching (Part 2)"

485
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:29,128
Next Conan's Hint:

486
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,528
"Word Written With Spray"

487
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,028
Kakudo, Kokudo and Sokudo.

488
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:34,428
-What is that? -They're words of excuses

489
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,528
that I can use the next time I mistakenly call you Kudo.
