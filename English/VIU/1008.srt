1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:05,449
A man named Haruyama Junpei-san was brutally murdered with a knife.

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:10,129
A man named Natsukawa Yoji-san was killed using the same method.

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,258
Ten years ago, the two murder victims,

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,048
along with Fuyuki Ryuzaburo-san and Akiba Miyako-san,

5
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:22,049
cheated a man named Komoto Takashi out of a large sum of money.

6
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:26,229
Komoto Takashi learned that he didn't have long left to live

7
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:29,399
and has been seeking revenge against the four of them.

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,779
However, Komoto accidentally fell off a cliff and was believed to have died.

9
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,059
But two days later, Akiba Miyako-san was killed using the same method.

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,218
Stabbed repeatedly with a knife.

11
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,909
Same method.

12
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,029
T.K.?

13
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,829
Komoto Takashi.

14
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:00,048
Akiba-san was murdered last night around 11 PM.

15
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:06,179
Komoto Takashi's fingerprints were found on the lighter left next to the body.

16
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:10,898
So Komoto survived his fall from that cliff.

17
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,689
And he has resumed his revenge murders.

18
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,229
Save me.

19
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,299
Please!

20
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,869
Incoming Call From Number-Withheld Public Telephone

21
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,209
Hello?

22
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,089
It's Komoto.

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,119
K-Komoto?

24
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,129
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

25
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,929
You'll pay for deceiving me ten years ago.

26
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,528
S-Spare me, Komoto!

27
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:44,078
I was wrong. I'll return your money.

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,768
I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

29
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,799
Money, money, money.

30
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,279
You think you can erase your sins with money.

31
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,339
No wonder you think you can buy your own life with money, too.

32
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,299
You're the same scumbag you ever were.

33
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,159
K-Komoto?

34
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,788
Komoto, hello? Komoto!

35
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,869
Spare me, Komoto!

36
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,448
Find him.

37
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,869
Do whatever it takes to find Komoto.

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:10,869
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,249
So his revenge wasn't over yet.

40
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,579
Yeah, but why did he bother to call him this time?

41
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,259
Because he's the one he hated the most.

42
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,509
He's the one who suggested they swindle him.

43
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,709
That's true, but...

44
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,739
Something's not right.

45
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,539
What is that?

46
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:01,549
What? You found Komoto's body?

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,049
Yes. The fingerprints are definitely a match, you say?

48
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,489
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

49
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,258
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

50
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,568
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

51
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,468
The suspect is missing, and the mystery deepens!

52
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,358
This revenge story takes a surprising turn!

53
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,968
Always determining the one truth

54
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,798
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

55
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,359
his name is Detective Conan!

56
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,089
"Out For Revenge, Part Two!"

57
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,548
The autopsy determined that the cause of death

58
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:17,059
was a cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the head.

59
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:21,298
Additionally, bruises and broken bones were found all over the body.

60
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:24,599
We believe he fell to his death from a rather high height.

61
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:29,989
The estimated time of death is the afternoon of the day before yesterday.

62
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,299
The afternoon of the day before yesterday?

63
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,489
Could it be?

64
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,008
Yes. That's the time Komoto fell at Shikigawa Valley.

65
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,919
So he really did die then.

66
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,799
I-In that case...

67
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:50,958
What was the body doing at a development site in a completely different area?

68
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,799
And who killed Akiba Miyako-san last night?

69
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,049
If he died when he fell, then...

70
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,689
There's only one conceivable explanation.

71
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,609
And what's that, Mori-kun?

72
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:16,109
Komoto Takashi's revenge against the four of them was interrupted.

73
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:19,619
A "Mr. X" is carrying on Komoto's will

74
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,869
and carrying out his revenge for him.

75
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,379
Carrying out his revenge?

76
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,879
That's right.

77
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:32,778
And in order to complete it as Komoto's revenge,

78
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,179
they used the same method to kill Akiba Miyako-san,

79
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,088
left Komoto's possession at the crime scene,

80
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,399
and pretended to be Komoto when they called Fuyuki.

81
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:43,938
I see.

82
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,649
It's certainly possible.

83
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:52,248
Komoto's accomplice Mr. X probably accompanied him

84
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,369
to the valley where he fell.

85
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,409
They quickly retrieved Komoto's body after he fell to his death,

86
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,919
and hid it at the development site so it wouldn't be discovered

87
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:10,419
so that we'd believe Komoto was alive and continuing to carry out his revenge.

88
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,268
That would explain why the body was buried.

89
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,559
And why Komoto's belongings were at the crime scene.

90
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,809
So, who is his collaborator Mr. X?

91
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,738
Based on the fact that they're carrying out his revenge

92
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,558
and have committed the heinous crime of murder,

93
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,238
it must be someone who feels deeply indebted to Komoto Takashi.

94
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,449
So they're returning a favor.

95
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:42,949
All right. Investigate Komoto's acquaintances based on Mori-kun's reasoning.

96
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:43,899
Yes, sir!

97
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,249
Also, Chiba.

98
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,688
Guard Fuyuki closely.

99
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,879
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:03,538
But even if Mr. X was indebted to Komoto, would he commit murder for him?

101
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,139
Mr. X must be incredibly conscientious.

102
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,909
I-Inspector?

103
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,808
Have you already identified Mr. X?

104
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,329
No, not yet.

105
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,249
It turns out that Mr. X called Fuyuki again.

106
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,459
Is that you, Fuyuki?

107
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,139
I'm sure you already know that I'm not Komoto.

108
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,719
I got revenge on a woman named Akiba Miyako for Komoto.

109
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:48,558
But taking a person's life has left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.

110
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,229
Y-You mean...

111
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,258
Anyway, I have a suggestion.

112
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,489
When I called this morning, you said you'd pay as much as I wanted, right?

113
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,678
Yeah, I did. I'll pay any amount.

114
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,779
How much do you want?

115
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,278
You really are a scumbag.

116
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,478
What?

117
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:09,759
Nevermind. I'll contact you later regarding the amount and handoff method.

118
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,668
It's odd, isn't it?

119
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,888
Mr. X is supposed to be carrying on Komoto's will to repay a favor,

120
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,759
but he's demanding cash now.

121
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,259
Maybe that was his real motive.

122
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,179
No, Inspector.

123
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,689
This is a trap.

124
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,688
A trap?

125
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,828
That's right.

126
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,338
He intends to make Fuyuki let his guard down by convincing him

127
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,319
that he'll be spared in exchange for money, and then kill him.

128
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,069
So that's how it is.

129
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,069
This is an opportunity to arrest him, Inspector.

130
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,329
We'll allow him to believe that we've fallen for his trap and catch him with his pants down.

131
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,509
The old man's deduction isn't impossible, but...

132
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,709
The Next Day

133
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:17,199
He won't be able to escape with this much security in the area.

134
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,419
Hey, officer.

135
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,369
He said he'd let me go if I paid him.

136
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:32,499
I'm telling you, that could be a trap.

137
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,419
Hey, mister.

138
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:43,589
Just waiting for him to attack doesn't feel very detective-like, does it?

139
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,599
Now that you mention it,

140
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,019
it doesn't give me an opportunity to show off my detective skills.

141
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,388
All right. I'll go find him.

142
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,599
Yeah.

143
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,299
Inspector.

144
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,259
A man is approaching.

145
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,649
He's got something wrapped around his stomach.

146
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,099
He's got a bomb wrapped around his stomach?

147
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,119
That's Mr. X?

148
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,368
Ow! What are you doing?

149
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:22,339
I've removed it!

150
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,839
That's a back brace!

151
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,849
Give it back, please!

152
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,108
Let's go, kid.

153
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:32,849
Okay.

154
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,828
We'll find them if we look into everyone who feels indebted to Komoto.

155
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,859
But is that really the right direction to investigate?

156
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:47,489
Mr. X could only have heard about Komoto's revenge plot from Komoto himself.

157
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,418
Yeah, but...

158
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:53,758
You'd only tell someone who felt deeply indebted to you

159
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,499
about your plans to kill someone.

160
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,228
He wouldn't bother retrieving a dead body

161
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:02,739
or burying one in the mountains unless he felt indebted to him.

162
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,129
Retrieve a dead body?

163
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,299
Wait a minute.

164
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,509
What if he had still been alive then?

165
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,439
That would mean...

166
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,518
Didn't you say then that someone else was there watching when he fell,

167
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,399
but that person disappeared at some point?

168
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,008
Yeah.

169
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,159
When I looked below the cliff,

170
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,659
there was someone fishing in the river.

171
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:36,718
I thought he must've seen it, too.

172
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,669
But by the time we got down the river, he was gone.

173
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,299
Do you know who he was?

174
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,219
No idea.

175
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,179
It was our first time going there.

176
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,858
He works at the hospital.

177
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:53,679
What?

178
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,418
He works at Shikigawa General Hospital.

179
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,689
He took care of me when I was in the hospital.

180
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,689
He's a very nice man named Otosaka-san.

181
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,519
Otosaka-san?

182
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,889
Give me some more time.

183
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,199
I've got something in mind. I promise I'll return it.

184
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,719
Otosaka-san.

185
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,669
Yes?

186
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,549
There's a child here to see you.

187
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:27,839
What? A child?

188
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:37,059
I'm Otosaka. Are you the one who wanted to see me?

189
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:42,059
The great Detective Mori Kogoro asked me to come here.

190
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,159
Mori Kogoro-san?

191
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:46,849
Yeah.

192
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,718
Yeah, I was working that afternoon.

193
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:00,709
I went fishing there in the morning.

194
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:04,459
But I didn't see anyone fall.

195
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,249
It must've happened after I left.

196
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,038
I see. I thought you might've seen something.

197
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,229
I'll let Kogoro-no-ojisan know.

198
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,229
Really? Sounds like Otosaka-san is having a hard time.

199
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:24,118
Don't tell anyone, though.

200
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:24,809
I won't.

201
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:28,268
By the way, it sounds like he goes fishing often.

202
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,439
He goes by car, right?

203
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:34,739
Yeah, probably. He always parks his car at the very end over there.

204
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:42,879
If he drives this car to work, then on the way here...

205
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,839
Shikigawa Valley

206
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,299
Otosaka-san, over here.

207
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:58,098
Huh? Didn't I run into you at the hospital?

208
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,188
Ah, you're that police officer.

209
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,108
What are you doing here?

210
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,349
Actually, I'm not sure.

211
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,359
Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me to bring Otosaka-san here, too.

212
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,609
Inspector.

213
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:19,718
Why did you ask us to come here, Mori-kun?

214
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,099
What? I didn't—

215
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:27,629
X^2 plus Y^2 squared equals... equals...

216
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:33,629
Otosaka Jinichi-kun, when you were fishing here three days ago,

217
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,369
a man named Komoto Takashi suddenly fell right before your eyes.

218
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,019
I told you, it was after I left that he fell.

219
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:51,849
No. Komoto screamed and fell right before your eyes.

220
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,599
He was badly injured but still alive, so you fished him out of the river.

221
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,948
Believing it would be faster to drive him to the hospital rather than call an ambulance,

222
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:06,999
you rushed towards the hospital at the foot of the mountain where you work.

223
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,169
On the way there, Komoto likely made a request.

224
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,908
Don't take me to the hospital.

225
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,259
What do you mean?

226
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,639
I don't have long to live anyway.

227
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:28,269
More importantly, I want you to hear my story.

228
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,719
Please.

229
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,859
Komoto described the revenge killings he had committed against the four so far.

230
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,029
Then he lamented the fact that he'd been unable to complete it.

231
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,539
Damn it. I was so close.

232
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,719
K-Komoto-san?

233
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,388
You mean...

234
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:57,049
Otosaka-kun is the Mr. X carrying out Komoto's revenge?

235
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:58,549
It's you?

236
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,088
That's right.

237
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,568
Normally you wouldn't tell anyone about your plan to kill someone,

238
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,419
but it's different if you're dying.

239
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,689
It's human nature to want to tell someone about your unfulfilled desires.

240
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:20,199
Having learned about Komoto Takashi's revenge plot,

241
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,699
Otosaka-kun came up with a way to use that to his advantage.

242
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,199
He decided to blackmail Fuyuki.

243
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,269
What?

244
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:35,569
He never had any intention of carrying on Komoto Takashi's will.

245
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:43,729
He killed Akiba Miyako-san to ensure that he'd get money from Fuyuki.

246
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,738
Once three of them were dead,

247
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:52,349
the terrified Fuyuki wouldn't hesitate to pay to save his own life.

248
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:58,859
So he killed Akiba Miyako-san just to stoke Fuyuki's fear.

249
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:05,119
You seem to be having trouble paying off your debt.

250
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:12,349
After burying and hiding Komoto Takashi's body, you killed Akiba Miyako-san.

251
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:16,128
You made it look like part of Komoto's revenge,

252
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,318
and then placed a threatening call.

253
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,649
It's Komoto.

254
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,348
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

255
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,838
I'll return your money.

256
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,139
I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

257
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,879
He made exactly the request you wanted him to make.

258
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:33,289
However, that's when things went wrong for you.

259
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,148
The body you'd hidden was discovered,

260
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,759
so you couldn't pretend to be Komoto anymore.

261
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:42,588
You revealed that you were an agent carrying out Komoto's revenge

262
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,979
and openly demanded money.

263
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,079
We read too deeply into the situation when we assumed it was a trap.

264
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,559
It was in fact his actual goal.

265
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,729
Mori-san, your theory doesn't have a scrap of evidence to back it up.

266
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,589
In the first place, I never rescued anyone named Komoto.

267
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,759
Then what were you doing then

268
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,429
at the convenience store parking lot between here and the hospital?

269
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:17,939
I found the security camera footage.

270
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,449
You got in the rear passenger seat and remained parked for over ten minutes.

271
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,579
What were you doing?

272
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,878
Komoto Takashi fell from this cliff around noon.

273
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,739
The estimated time of death is around that same time.

274
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,898
But since you were working that afternoon,

275
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:50,489
there wasn't enough time for you to start your shift after visiting that development site.

276
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,349
In other words, you hid the body after you finished work.

277
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:01,359
Which means Komoto's body was in your car when you started your shift.

278
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:08,239
You mean the body I was looking for was nearby then?

279
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,099
Yes.

280
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:13,749
It was probably hidden out of sight in his car.

281
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:21,669
Then we should be able to find Komoto Takashi's hair or blood in his car if we search it.

282
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:22,898
Yeah.

283
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,419
That would prove that he abandoned the body.

284
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,458
We should be able to find something belonging

285
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,179
to the culprit at the scene of Akiba Miyako-san's murder, too.

286
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,308
If we compare them against yours,

287
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,969
I'm sure of them will be a match.

288
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,299
Everything you've said is correct, Mori-san.

289
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,279
I tried to blackmail this scumbag.

290
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:53,279
You jerk.

291
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:57,789
Both you and that Akiba woman are terrible people.

292
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,039
That doesn't make it okay to murder to blackmail someone.

293
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,839
I'm not in debt because I blew my money having fun.

294
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,149
I know people who are in trouble. Several of them.

295
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:22,459
I had to help them.

296
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,918
Perhaps he's not lying.

297
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,148
He probably rescued Komoto Takashi from the river

298
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,489
and attempted to take him to the hospital out of the goodness of his heart, but...

299
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:37,018
Yeah.

300
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,998
He stepped off the right path when he decided to use Komoto's death.

301
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,659
The fact is, he did something unforgivable.

302
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,509
What a stupid man.

303
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:52,259
This all began because of the misdeeds you committed ten years ago.

304
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:56,579
Surely you don't think you'll escape your own guilt.

305
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,458
I guess I solved another case, huh?

306
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:33,489
Anyway, who the heck is Otosaka?

307
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,359
I must be a great detective if I identified him as the culprit without knowing who he is.

308
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,739
Hey, Conan.

309
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,059
What are you doing?

310
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:54,879
Nothing.

311
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,389
Miss, are you Yamaki Shinobu-san?

312
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,818
Shinobu is my older brother.

313
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,769
What? Your brother?

314
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:13,469
The next episode of Conan is "The Lost Article That Smells Like a Case!"
