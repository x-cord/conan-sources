1
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:02,826
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:04,826
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:06,226
Is it a prank played by the god of matchmaking?

4
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,826
Conan challenges the mystery of a murder.

5
00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:09,626
That is analogous to the story of the "Eight-Forked Serpent".

6
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,126
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,926
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,927
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,303
So...

10
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:02,903
I'm going to check out the famous sightseeing spots

11
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:05,704
and drink up the "all-you-can-drink"!

12
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:11,004
He's 180 degrees unlike what he was in the plane.

13
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:16,914
The place we came to visit this time

14
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:20,315
is the home of mythology, Izumo.

15
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:27,415
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 1)"

16
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,714
Izumo Shrine is where the God for matchmaking is enshrined.

17
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,714
I can understand Ran praying with passion, but...

18
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:38,114
Please, please do find me a good match.

19
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,815
Gosh. I wonder what kind of match he is expecting.

20
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,614
I'll tie mine here.

21
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:49,014
For a good match, a good match!

22
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,614
Gosh.

23
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:53,514
So this is Japan's greatest "Ooshimenawa".

24
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,914
It sure is huge!

25
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,214
Well, this is fantastic.

26
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:00,114
It weighs five tons.

27
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:03,714
Five tons?

28
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,414
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

29
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:07,514
The famed detective.

30
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:09,414
Yes.

31
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:13,415
You look way better in person than on television.

32
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,414
Do you work here?

33
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,714
"Eiko Esumi (25)" -I'm Eiko Esumi.

34
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,614
I run a Japanese inn in front of the path to this shrine.

35
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,414
A Japanese inn?

36
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:29,014
I'm his daughter, Ran. And he's Conan.

37
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:30,514
Hello.

38
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:34,514
Excuse me, what's that money there?

39
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,614
Really!

40
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,714
There's so much money stuck to it.

41
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:39,914
I guess you can call it a tradition?

42
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,214
If the coin gets stuck on it, they say your wish is granted.

43
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:45,815
Which means, I'll meet the person of my dreams?

44
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,715
There! Go for it!

45
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,814
Darn it.

46
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,014
There!

47
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,515
Darn you!

48
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,914
Darn it!

49
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,714
Your wish will probably never be granted.

50
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:10,414
How lucky to have a hometown in a place where the God of matchmaking is.

51
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:14,814
I have a tentative offer for marriage, too.

52
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,214
Tentative?

53
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,215
What?

54
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,214
Is it with someone you don't really care for?

55
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:24,614
I get it! That man is poor.

56
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,714
I think he has money.

57
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:29,014
Because he's involved in large-scale business.

58
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,014
Maybe he has a bad personality.

59
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:36,014
A rich man with bad personality is the worst match in any category.

60
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:38,615
You should call off the marriage.

61
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:41,114
Dad!

62
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,014
But I have a reason for not being able to refuse.

63
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,414
When you get married,

64
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:48,114
it should be with someone that you really love, right?

65
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:50,914
What is the name of that man?

66
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,114
Mr. Koji Wanibuchi.

67
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,214
No matter what reasons you may have,

68
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:59,014
reluctantly getting married with Mr. Wanibuchi

69
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,014
is like giving yourself up as human sacrifice.

70
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:02,614
Dad!

71
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:04,414
I'm sorry for what he said.

72
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:09,114
Don't be. Because Mr. Mouri is saying this for me.

73
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,514
Right, Conan?

74
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:14,214
Shall we go see an interesting miniature model?

75
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,314
An interesting miniature model?

76
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,514
Did Izumo Shrine look like this before?

77
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,314
This is indeed...

78
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,214
The world of mythology!

79
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:26,414
This seems to be the biggest shrine in all of Japan.

80
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,614
I'm not sure of the details.

81
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,114
It is a shrine that was built towards the end of the Heian Period

82
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,114
to the first part of the Kamakura Period.

83
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,314
Ryo!

84
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,414
Sorry, can you wait a while?

85
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:38,414
Yep.

86
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:41,314
He's Ryosuke Fukama, a childhood friend of mine.

87
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,014
He used to like ancient history since he was a child.

88
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,515
"Ryosuke Fukama (25)" -He's lucky because he's working doing what he likes.

89
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,414
Eiko actually likes Mr. Fukuma.

90
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,015
Yep. I'm sure he likes her, too.

91
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,614
How exasperating.

92
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,714
All three pillars were created

93
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:04,015
by bunching three huge trees together as one...

94
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,614
Eiko is going to be taken away by a rich guy with bad personality

95
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,914
because you don't keep a firm grip on her!

96
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:13,114
Yes?

97
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,314
Mr. Mouri.

98
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:15,914
Dad!

99
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,314
I'm really sorry.

100
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,614
No, it's okay.

101
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:23,314
Mr. Mouri. Thank you for today.

102
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:26,414
Not at all. Get a grip of yourself, okay?

103
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,414
You seem to be saying good stuff,

104
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,814
but who knows what's actually on your mind.

105
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,815
The following day, murder is committed.

106
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:49,414
A current price of 10,000,000 yen?

107
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,314
That does it.

108
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,914
Stabbed right in the back.

109
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,214
Don't let outsiders in here!

110
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,114
Don't tell me that you're...

111
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:04,114
I'm Mouri, a private detective from Tokyo.

112
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:05,414
Just as I thought!

113
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,114
I've heard of your activities.

114
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:08,914
I'm Officer Yamane of the Izumo Police Department.

115
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:10,414
Likewise, I'm Officer Komura.

116
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,814
It's amazing how you got here.

117
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,314
I just happened to be nearby.

118
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:18,114
However, there seems to be no need for the assistance

119
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:21,114
of a famed detective for this case.

120
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:23,014
How's that?

121
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:27,714
The victim is Mr. Koji Wanibuchi, the owner of Wanibuchi Sogyo,

122
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:32,114
that is doing extensive business centering around the Izumo area, age 35.

123
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:34,914
Koji Wanibuchi?

124
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:37,814
The fiance that Eiko was talking about yesterday?

125
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:40,214
He was killed.

126
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,014
So you know him.

127
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,314
He is a famous businessman that is well-known locally,

128
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:45,914
as being a wheeler-dealer.

129
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,414
The person who found him is that couple over there.

130
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,814
They're locals.

131
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:54,714
Well, this is not a place that tourists would come.

132
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,714
The estimated time of death is around 13:00.

133
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:01,414
Mr. Wanibuchi's watch is thought to have broken when he fell.

134
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,814
It is stopped at 13:05.

135
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:07,414
It's probably okay to determine that it was time the murder was committed.

136
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:10,114
The motive of the killing was probably due to grudge.

137
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,914
Being a wheeler-dealer businessman,

138
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,814
he must've had a lot of enemies, too.

139
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:17,014
He seems to have had a bad personality, too.

140
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,214
It's true that he didn't have a good reputation,

141
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,714
but the purpose of the killer

142
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:25,114
was to steal his sword that is worth 10,000,000 yen.

143
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:27,715
A sword priced at 10,000,000 yen?

144
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:30,915
This is Mr. Wanibuchi's notebook.

145
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:35,314
He was scheduled to go to a local antique shop today

146
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:39,214
and get the sword as collateral for lending money this afternoon.

147
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:42,314
I confirmed with the shop and found that at around 12:00 noon,

148
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,214
they gave the sword to Mr. Wanibuchi as promised.

149
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:49,814
After receiving the sword, Mr. Wanibuchi came here to Inome.

150
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,114
And we're not sure for what, but at around before 13:00,

151
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,714
he was witnessed standing holding the sword.

152
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:59,014
However, when his body was found,

153
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,214
the sword was nowhere in sight.

154
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:05,314
The killer who saw him receive the sword at the antique shop

155
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,315
may have tailed Mr. Wanibuchi and...

156
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:20,014
So you see, this is a simple case of robbing treasure.

157
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:23,014
So there is no need for a detective.

158
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:24,915
Yes, now I clearly understand.

159
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:31,114
I wonder if this case is really all that simple?

160
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,414
Why come out all the way to a place like this?

161
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,515
Moreover, bringing a sword worth 10,000,000 yen along?

162
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,414
What are you thinking about?

163
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,215
I'm not thinking anything!

164
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,614
I hate to say this about the late Mr. Wanibuchi,

165
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:49,614
but Eiko won't have to get married reluctantly anymore.

166
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:53,714
-Ran! -I know that I shouldn't be saying this.

167
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:56,314
But you were saying so yourself yesterday, too.

168
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:58,714
That it's like human sacrifice.

169
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,914
Well, you see, that was...

170
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,414
Wait. This case sounds similar

171
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:05,714
to the story of getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent, doesn't it?

172
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,014
Getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent?

173
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,714
The mythology of Susano-o-no-mikoto.

174
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:13,414
There was an unfortunate princess

175
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:15,814
that was about to be taken away against her will,

176
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,514
when Susano-o appears to save her.

177
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,814
Thanks to Susano-o for getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent,

178
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:23,214
the princess is rescued.

179
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,014
And Susano-o gets a hold of the Eight-forked serpent's sword.

180
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:27,714
It sure is similar.

181
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:30,014
Right?

182
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,814
Susano-o-no-mikoto may be a hero,

183
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,014
but the killer is nothing close to it!

184
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:39,214
It just so happened to help Eiko out,

185
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,814
but the guy is a robber!

186
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,314
I know that.

187
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,914
All I'm saying is that it seems similar to the mythology

188
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:48,414
about getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent.

189
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,814
Right, Conan?

190
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,314
Yeah.

191
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:56,315
This case was not just a simple robbery after all.

192
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:08,214
Once a year, when the Gods from all over Japan gather at Izumo,

193
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:11,414
it is said that they land here on Inasanohama.

194
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:14,014
What? They're not listening.

195
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,514
I'm explaining this to you.

196
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:18,015
I wonder if something happened?

197
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:28,015
Don't tell me that this is...

198
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,014
I confirmed it with the antique shop owner

199
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:33,814
and was told that it was indeed the sword in question.

200
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,214
Just as I thought.

201
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,314
I don't understand.

202
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,414
Why would you hide the treasure

203
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:40,614
so that it get covered with sand like this?

204
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,714
It was probably thrown away, not hidden,

205
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,214
because whoever it was didn't need it anymore.

206
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:49,714
Taking the sword away from the site of the murder was a camouflage

207
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:52,714
to deceive people into thinking it was a robbery.

208
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,414
It's most likely

209
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:58,914
that the real motive of the culprit was to take Mr. Wanibuchi's life.

210
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:02,714
The real motive is most probably a grudge.

211
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,514
Get a list on the double of his business rivals

212
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,714
as well as all the people in Mr. Wanibuchi's private life

213
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,514
that he was having problems with.

214
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,614
Yes, sir!

215
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:13,615
What is it?

216
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,415
Oh, no.

217
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,514
After the list was made,

218
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:23,415
the following day, four people were called in by the police.

219
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:29,315
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma were also among the people who were summoned.

220
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,707
I will be questioning everyone by turn.

221
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,708
But before that,

222
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,907
I would like to introduce someone who will be helping us with this case.

223
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,407
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

224
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,708
I'm Mouri.

225
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,108
That famed detective?

226
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,507
"Takehiko Fujie (40)" -Well, I didn't think that a famed detective

227
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:56,008
would be in Izumo.

228
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,107
First of all, Mr. Kazuya Ishitobi.

229
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:01,307
Yes, sir.

230
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:02,607
According to our investigation,

231
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:07,207
"Kazuya Ishitobi (35)" -Mr. Wanibuchi approached your shop of long standing

232
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,907
asking if you'd like to joint-manage the shop with him, is that right?

233
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,908
Joint management, my foot!

234
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,007
Wanibuchi Sogyo will take care of all the management finances.

235
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,907
All you have to do is lend me the name Ishitobi,

236
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,207
and we'll open stores throughout Japan.

237
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,007
Fantastic, don't you think?

238
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:28,408
You're not thinking of refusing, are you?

239
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,107
He tried to take over "Ishitobi"

240
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:35,207
that had been in business for 2,000 years by threat and money!

241
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,807
I see.

242
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:39,407
Next, Mr. Takehiko Fujie.

243
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:43,107
You run a wedding hall called Ryounkaku and...

244
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:46,507
The same went for my place as Mr. Ishitobi just mentioned.

245
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,607
We at Wanibuchi Sogyo are thinking of going into

246
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,507
the wedding hall management business.

247
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,508
What?

248
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,607
But I do not want to fight for customers

249
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,307
with Ryounkaku that is a place of long standing.

250
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,107
So I would like to make a proposal.

251
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,607
We would like to invest our capital in your company

252
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,507
and would like to carry out joint-management with you.

253
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:05,708
What do you think?

254
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,008
Mr. Fujie, my superior?

255
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,107
He wanted to take over.

256
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,007
Superior?

257
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,807
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

258
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,207
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

259
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,507
I see. At the university.

260
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:26,907
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

261
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,007
A monster that swallows up anything he targets as prey.

262
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,608
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

263
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:35,807
I see.

264
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:40,607
Ms. Eiko Esumi, you also had business connections with Mr. Wanibuchi?

265
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,707
Yes, sir.

266
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,707
Our inn, Hinodeya, is also an inn of long standing,

267
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,707
but wear and tear kept getting worse.

268
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,107
But we couldn't afford to renovate it.

269
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,407
At about that time, we were contacted by a company in Tokyo

270
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,607
saying that they'd like to build a modern hotel in its place,

271
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,407
so they would like us to sell them our land.

272
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,607
Just when my parents were thinking,

273
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,508
there was no other choice than to let go of the inn.

274
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:04,107
It's absurd that an inn with such long standing

275
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,507
as Hinodeya go out of business.

276
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:09,007
Let us help you with the renovation fees.

277
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,207
For the sake of Izumo.

278
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,707
It was unexpected.

279
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,207
Because from what I heard of him, he was a greedy man and nothing else.

280
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,807
My parents accepted his offer thankfully

281
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:22,007
and renovated the inn, but...

282
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,407
Let my daughter marry you?

283
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:26,407
What's come over you all of a sudden?

284
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,607
It's not all of a sudden.

285
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,807
I lent you the money for renovation

286
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,107
because this is the birth home of my future wife.

287
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,207
For what other reason would anybody do this?

288
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,407
He was planning on it to begin with.

289
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,907
He said to give the total of the money he lent back right away,

290
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,807
if I refuse to marry him.

291
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,607
Oh, no.

292
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:47,607
My parents told me that if they have to give me up to a guy like that,

293
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,207
they'd rather let go of the inn.

294
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,007
But I know how much that inn

295
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:56,907
that has been handed down for generations mean to them.

296
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,307
That's why I...

297
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,807
Mr. Fukuma.

298
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,107
Not being able to leave Ms. Esumi in her plight,

299
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,407
you went time and again to ask Mr. Wanibuchi

300
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:07,307
to let her go, didn't you?

301
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:08,707
I hated him.

302
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,908
I hated that man, too.

303
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,307
Next, at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

304
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,907
please tell me where and what each of you were doing

305
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:27,607
at around 13:00 yesterday.

306
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,107
First of all...

307
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:31,607
I was at Matsue Castle!

308
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,507
Matsue Castle?

309
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:37,207
I was alone so I have no one to prove it.

310
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,908
That's right. I signed my name on the list of the castle tower.

311
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,007
Mr. Fukuma.

312
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:48,007
It was my day off yesterday,

313
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,908
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

314
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:54,607
I was there from a little before noon to about 3:00.

315
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:57,207
I go there often, because I can relax there.

316
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:01,307
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses to prove it.

317
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,307
Then Mr. Ishitobi.

318
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:07,607
I was at the Izumo Traditional Culture Museum.

319
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,807
I was alone, too.

320
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,407
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

321
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,708
I was at Hinomisaki.

322
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,007
I was alone, too.

323
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:23,007
It was a little too early for seagulls

324
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,607
that I didn't get to see them.

325
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,507
Komura, split up and check on the alibis.

326
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:28,508
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,907
They're all famous sightseeing spots,

328
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,207
so many people must've seen them.

329
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,407
That is, if they're telling the truth.

330
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,108
Exactly.

331
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,007
How was it?

332
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,107
Yes, sir.

333
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,707
Mr. Fujie's alibi's been confirmed.

334
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,507
It was written in his handwriting

335
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:53,407
and judging from the names written by the people there,

336
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:57,107
it is thought that he was certainly in Matsue at 13:05.

337
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,807
13:05.

338
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,707
He wrote his name on the list at the very time

339
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,707
the victim was killed.

340
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,107
The time it takes to get from Matsue Castle

341
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,307
to Inome, the scene of the crime

342
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,407
is about 40 minutes to an hour by car.

343
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:12,807
I see.

344
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,408
So I'm not a suspect anymore.

345
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,307
The problem is the remaining three of you.

346
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,607
We cannot get any eyewitnesses at all.

347
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,007
Not even one?

348
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,507
Not even one, for all three of them.

349
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:31,707
But we can't keep you here just because we can't confirm your alibis.

350
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,207
You may have to come in for questioning again,

351
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,507
but you may go for today.

352
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,008
Thank you for your cooperation.

353
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:46,207
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

354
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,607
No.

355
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,807
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

356
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,708
Could it be that they're lying?

357
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,707
Yes, this is Yamane.

358
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,407
Yes. Yes.

359
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,007
What?

360
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,407
I see. Okay!

361
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,707
Call him back!

362
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,307
Ryosuke Fukuma!

363
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,107
Yes, sir!

364
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,307
Yesterday at around 14:00,

365
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,807
we found a witness that said he saw someone

366
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:17,207
burying something at Inasanohama.

367
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,908
The man who was witnessed was a tall, lanky man.

368
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,507
Sand from Inasanohama

369
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,307
and soil from Inome Cave were detected from your shoes.

370
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:30,807
You did it, didn't you?

371
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:33,208
You killed Mr. Wanibuchi, didn't you?

372
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,108
I stand mute.

373
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:39,407
He's exercising his right to remain silent?

374
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,107
Yes. But if he's the one who did it,

375
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:46,107
that explains why there were no witnesses at Old Taisha Station.

376
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,707
Because he had killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome

377
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,407
and got rid of the sword at Inasanohama.

378
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:55,507
I guess he's the one, Ryosuke Fukuma.

379
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,907
Oh, no!

380
00:19:56,908 --> 00:20:00,107
Since the sand and soil were found on his shoes,

381
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,207
as well as a witness having seen him,

382
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,207
he probably did take the sword away from the site,

383
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,107
and buried it at the beach.

384
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:11,908
But it's not enough to conclude that he's the one who killed the victim.

385
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,707
I was at Hinomisaki.

386
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,707
That reaction.

387
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:22,407
Mr. Fukuma knew where Eiko really was at that time.

388
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,008
Which means...

389
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,708
Hey, where do you think you're going?

390
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,107
You brat.

391
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,407
Why did you go into the interrogation room on your own?

392
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,107
No, Conan!

393
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,107
Because I think

394
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,107
that Mr. Fukuma isn't saying anything

395
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,308
because he's protecting the real killer.

396
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,207
Just as I thought.

397
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,807
I'm right.

398
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:56,307
He probably saw the real killer killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome Cave.

399
00:20:56,308 --> 00:21:00,207
But I wonder who that real killer is?

400
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,407
Who else would he have to protect other than that one person?

401
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:07,407
You witnessed Ms. Eiko Esumi commit the murder.

402
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:11,207
That's why you took the sword away to make it look like a robbery.

403
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,007
Is that it?

404
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:16,107
I did it! I'm the one who killed Wanibuchi!

405
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,407
It's too late saying it now.

406
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,707
Me?

407
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,207
It's not me!

408
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,407
Then at the time Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

409
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:28,207
where were you really at?

410
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,507
You said you were at Hinomisaki, but nobody saw you there.

411
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,907
The lighthouse worker nor the souvenir shop employee, nobody!

412
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,307
Well...

413
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:39,907
She's doing the same thing as Mr. Fukuma.

414
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:42,307
She sounds like she's protecting somebody.

415
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:45,407
It was my day off yesterday,

416
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,707
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

417
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,108
It could be that...

418
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,607
I'll bet you're protecting Mr. Fukuma

419
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,308
because you know that he's the killer?

420
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,808
I was right after all.

421
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,407
Hey!

422
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,408
Ran, come with me!

423
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,207
Conan, what are you doing?

424
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,408
What is going on, Mr. Mouri?

425
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,408
The lovers are protecting each other.

426
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,207
Which of you is the killer?

427
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,007
Neither of them may be the killer?

428
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,607
We're going to prove that!

429
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,808
And where to?

430
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,708
To Old Taisha Station.

431
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,107
"Next Episode."

432
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,807
All the suspects are innocent now.

433
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,008
So it seems.

434
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:08,007
What is going on?

435
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:11,407
Logging in the time suddenly started from yesterday?

436
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,307
I don't think that's right.

437
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:15,507
Misunderstanding based on subjective impression?

438
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:18,207
I'm Kogoro Mouri, I'd like to see you.

439
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,508
As to what it's about, I'd like to tell you in person when I see you.

440
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:28,508
Next Conan, "The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 2)"

441
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,507
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:48,507
"False testimony."

443
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:50,907
-Did you pray to get together with Shinichi? -No.

444
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,207
Then who did you pray to get together with?

445
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,308
Tell me!
