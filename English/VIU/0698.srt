1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,083
In the morning of our day off,

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,683
in order to do our homework of sketching,

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,608
we came to the suburbs of Beika City.

4
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:10,283
-Hey. -Don't tell me that, that's a...

5
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:12,083
No doubt about!

6
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,483
That's indeed a UFO!

7
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:15,983
An Adamsky type!

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,083
It really existed!

9
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,783
Hey, hey.

10
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:21,183
Conan Edogawa.

11
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,683
Look.

12
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:30,183
What on earth...

13
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:34,083
Aim for a 100% solution.

14
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,383
Clear all mysteries and codes.

15
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,183
A UFO crashes and is found in the dry riverbed.

16
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,383
What is the secret that the victim hid?

17
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:41,983
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:44,083
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,983
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:34,037
"Unbelievable! UFO Crashes"

21
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,895
-Right now, we know that... -Officer Takagi!

22
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,295
You!

23
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,595
You shouldn't do this!

24
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:45,795
You're supposed let children into the site.

25
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:50,195
Well, but they insisted that they are your friends, so...

26
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,495
Friends maybe, but...

27
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:55,995
What an unlucky person, though.

28
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,195
To be crushed by a UFO

29
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,495
that came flying from way out in outer space.

30
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:03,395
Hey... You shouldn't be here!

31
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,595
Did they find the spaceman that was on board?

32
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,495
Huh? No... Well, rather...

33
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,995
Did he get away?

34
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:13,295
I guess you would call it hit-and-run in earth terms?

35
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,395
-Yeah. -No, that's not it.

36
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,595
Hey, Officer Takagi.

37
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:21,795
The flap of his pocket is ripped off.

38
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:22,895
Yeah.

39
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:25,995
It seems he hooked it onto something and it got torn.

40
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,795
Rather, give me a break, Conan.

41
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,295
He's wearing clothes that pretty flashy.

42
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,895
Who is he, anyway?

43
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:36,795
Yes...

44
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:41,495
The victim is Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi of Beikacho, age 22.

45
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:45,095
The estimated time of death is around 01:00 yesterday.

46
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:48,295
He was crushed twice by that UFO and died.

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,695
This is all the information we have for now.

48
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,095
Now that you know, hurry out of here.

49
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,695
He was crushed twice.

50
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:00,595
Two bruises in two separate places were seen on the corpse.

51
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,995
Well, on the 2nd bruise, there were no signs of life.

52
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,595
It seems he died from the first impact.

53
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:09,995
At any rate, I can't afford to have Inspector Megure

54
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,095
see me with you people.

55
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:14,395
I found it!

56
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,895
Here you are!

57
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:19,495
-Who is he? -I wonder.

58
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,795
I looked all over for you!

59
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,495
My flying saucer!

60
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,295
Hey, you!

61
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:30,995
Just what're you doing? Get down!

62
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,595
Give it back to me!

63
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:36,795
Give it back? Who on earth are you?

64
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,195
Me? I'm...

65
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,495
I'm Doctor Shozo Konuma, a physicist.

66
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,495
I worked alone for 30 years for this!

67
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,995
I absorbed all my time and energy for this flying saucer!

68
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,195
What?

69
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:56,995
You mean it didn't come flying from outer space?

70
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,495
Exactly!

71
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,195
It came from my research lab a little ways from here.

72
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:05,195
But it's still incomplete. I wonder how it flew over here.

73
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:08,195
How strange.

74
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:12,995
I'm part-timing at night at a convenience store.

75
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,095
To make money for this research,

76
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,295
I also went to work last night,

77
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,495
and when I returned to the lab this morning, it was gone.

78
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:22,195
Well, if the person who made it says it's incomplete,

79
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,895
there's no way it could fly.

80
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,195
-But... -But...

81
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,195
Doctor Konuma.

82
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,795
Wasn't that truck also at the lab last night?

83
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,195
That?

84
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,795
It's true that I always have it parked with the key inside it.

85
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:38,495
Because it's troublesome to look for the key.

86
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:40,795
Then, the story's simple.

87
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,495
That UFO didn't come flying,

88
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,395
but was brought here by someone on that truck.

89
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:47,695
I see.

90
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,095
Come to think of it, it's so simple.

91
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,195
What a waste it was to get thrilled over it.

92
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,795
But if it didn't come flying here,

93
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:57,995
why was he crushed by that UFO?

94
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:01,595
What? Did my flying saucer crush somebody?

95
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,695
We, the police think this is a homicide.

96
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,695
Homicide?

97
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:07,995
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:12,495
The culprit probably fainted the victim Mr. Iwabuchi beforehand,

99
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:14,695
laid him down in this dry riverbed.

100
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:17,295
Then dropped the flying saucer that he brought from your lab

101
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:20,195
down from the bridge.

102
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:22,695
-And twice, too. -My god.

103
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,595
But, Officer Takagi...

104
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:28,995
Why did the culprit go out of his way to use the flying saucer?

105
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:31,795
That's what bothers me.

106
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,795
At any rate, Dr. Konuma,

107
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:36,495
would you please take us to your lab?

108
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:40,395
I don't mind, but will you give this back to me?

109
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:44,395
I'm sorry, but it's a vital piece of evidence.

110
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,795
Just as I thought.

111
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:49,695
Okay, kids. Leave the rest to the police.

112
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:50,695
Yep!

113
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:53,895
We have to work on doing our homework of sketching.

114
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,895
Hang in there, Officer Takagi.

115
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,995
-Bye. -See you later.

116
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,295
See you.

117
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:06,495
Can you really make a flying saucer in a place like this?

118
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,395
True.

119
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,895
Why are you here?

120
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,295
What do you mean why?

121
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:15,395
Of course we came here to sketch this lab!

122
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:16,595
Is that so?

123
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:19,895
The exterior is probably shabby to protect secrecy,

124
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:22,095
to keep everyone else away from here!

125
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,095
I see!

126
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:27,095
Then, I'll bet the inside is full of super computers and such!

127
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:30,195
Okay, let's look inside then!

128
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,195
Yeah!

129
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,095
I wonder about that.

130
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:37,195
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

131
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,995
How do you like my Konuma Flying Saucer research laboratory?

132
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:52,595
At any rate, we need clues to the culprit.

133
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,495
-Let's search. -Yep.

134
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,595
Right.

135
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:58,195
Where was that flying saucer kept?

136
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,795
It was suspended over there.

137
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:04,695
I wanted to dream of it flying.

138
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:07,595
He had it hanging from the ceiling.

139
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,895
It sure is rusty.

140
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,895
It probably broke off

141
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,595
when the culprit removed the flying saucer.

142
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,895
It seems to have been ready to broke off to begin with, anyway.

143
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,795
Officer Takagi.

144
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,395
Look.

145
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,895
There's something like this here.

146
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,795
It's not mine.

147
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,595
Just as I thought.

148
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:37,095
There's something that looks like a name here.

149
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,695
Mannen?

150
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,295
Mannen...

151
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,995
I don't know that name!

152
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,895
It's the culprit's hat!

153
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:46,295
The culprit's name is Mannen.

154
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,595
Conan. Over here.

155
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:53,595
-This is... -Yep.

156
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,595
It's his, right?

157
00:08:56,595 --> 00:09:00,195
I didn't see that piece of cloth yesterday, though.

158
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:03,395
Which means that, not only this person called Mannen,

159
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:06,595
but Mr. Iwabuchi who was killed was also here.

160
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:09,495
They probably came here together.

161
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,995
-Chiba. -I investigated and found that

162
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:13,795
Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi had a person

163
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,795
that he thought of as a brother, that he got along with.

164
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:19,095
This is the victim, Mr. Iwabuchi.

165
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,195
Yes.

166
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:24,395
And the other half of this odd couple is Sadao Mannen.

167
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,995
He is like a "big brother" to Mr. Iwabuchi.

168
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,595
-Mannen? -Mannen?

169
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,095
And these two were at a restaurant yesterday.

170
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,895
That's why I'm telling you that I'll pay off

171
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:35,295
everything I owe you altogether tomorrow!

172
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,395
Right, "Buchi"?

173
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:40,395
We're expecting big cash to come in.

174
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:43,595
It's highly probably that they broke in here last night

175
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,395
to search for valuables.

176
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:47,495
But if Mannen is the culprit,

177
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:50,095
why would he have killed his "kid brother"?

178
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,395
That too, but it's hard to think that

179
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:56,195
they came here to look for cash too, though, no?

180
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,295
True. No offense,

181
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,895
but there's nothing here that looks valuable enough to sell off.

182
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:05,295
There is! That treasure!

183
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,395
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

184
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,795
I bought at the end of last month.

185
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,895
It seems to be the work of a famous calligrapher,

186
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,895
and cost me 50,000 yen!

187
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:16,195
-50,000 yen? -50,000 yen?

188
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,695
It was sold to me at this very cheap price

189
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:20,195
because the seller thought it was just the thing for me.

190
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,695
He was a man called Mr. Okura.

191
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,395
Well, that's not it.

192
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:27,995
Okura...

193
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,095
Do you mean Kinji Okura?

194
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:32,395
Yes.

195
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,895
Kinji Okura, the loan shark?

196
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,195
Yes. Mannen and Iwabuchi

197
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:41,195
were both hired by him as money collectors.

198
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,795
They were henchmen of Okura!

199
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:47,395
Is Mr. Okura a problem?

200
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:49,895
He's suspected of tax evasion.

201
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:54,395
The National Tax Office raided his place at the beginning of this month

202
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,395
for hiding assets in the billions,

203
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:58,795
but God knows where he hid it.

204
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,795
They weren't able to come up with the hidden asset after all.

205
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:08,695
So, that's the kind of guy he was, that Mr. Okura.

206
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:10,695
He's a money-monger.

207
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,895
He used to boast that anything under a million yen is not money.

208
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,895
-Strange. -Yeah.

209
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,095
I wonder if a guy like him

210
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,495
would sell a fake hanging scroll for 50,000 yen.

211
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:24,295
Then maybe the two snuck in here

212
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:27,395
by order of Mr. Okura?

213
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,595
No, Kinji Okura died the day before yesterday

214
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,695
in a traffic accident.

215
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:34,895
Huh?

216
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,595
But maybe he's not totally uninvolved, right?

217
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,495
Because the two people working under him suck into the place

218
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:43,695
where he sold the hanging scroll to.

219
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,495
It's true it doesn't seem like a coincidence.

220
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,395
Shall we go check on it?

221
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,195
The last people who saw Okura

222
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,695
at his death bed in Beika Central Hospital

223
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,795
seems to have been Mannen and Iwabuchi.

224
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,995
Okay, let's.

225
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:01,095
"Beika Central Hospital"

226
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,795
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

227
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:06,795
It's about Mr. Kinji Okura who was carried here by ambulance?

228
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,895
Could you tell us about his last moments?

229
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:14,395
But he was already unconscious when he got here.

230
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,795
He did say something strange just before he died.

231
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,595
What is it, boss?

232
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,695
U... UFO...

233
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,795
That was his last word.

234
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:34,295
UFO?

235
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,095
If you will excuse me.

236
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,195
UFO!

237
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,495
I got it.

238
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,995
I'm sorry, I have an emergency patient.

239
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,295
Thank you very much.

240
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,995
He was probably referring to that hanging scroll.

241
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,995
Huh? You...

242
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:53,095
Maybe he regretted selling something fake like that.

243
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,995
-Right. -Yep.

244
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:58,595
I wonder if he's someone that commendable.

245
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,395
Hey, Officer Chiba.

246
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,295
Mr. Okura loved money, didn't he?

247
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,095
Yeah.

248
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:09,095
The last words that a person like that would leave behind

249
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,495
would more or less be the same, wouldn't they?

250
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,353
Although Mr. Kinji Okura was thought

251
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:24,523
to have hidden assets of billions of yen,

252
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:27,223
they couldn't find it here in this office.

253
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,423
No.

254
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:31,123
Even his house was thoroughly search, too.

255
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:34,623
You said they did so at the beginning of this month, right?

256
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:37,723
And, just a little before that, at the end of last month,

257
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:41,723
Mr. Okura sold that hanging scroll to Dr. Konuma.

258
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:43,123
So?

259
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,823
A person like him who used say,

260
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,023
anything under a million yen is not money...

261
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:48,823
Would that kind of man go out of his way

262
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,423
to sell something for 50,000 yen?

263
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:55,723
He probably sold it because he had another purpose.

264
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:57,523
Another purpose?

265
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,223
Depending on how you look at it,

266
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:03,023
you couldn't find a safer place than that lab, could you?

267
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:05,523
No robbers would attempt breaking in.

268
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:08,923
I see! Okura probably went to sell the hanging scroll

269
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,623
to hide his hidden assets?

270
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,523
He went to sell the hanging scroll

271
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,923
and when the Doctor wasn't looking,

272
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:18,023
he hid his assets somewhere in that lab!

273
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,123
As a temporary place of hiding,

274
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:23,423
that place where even a robber would stay away from is a safe place.

275
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,223
The hanging scroll was just an excuse to go there.

276
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:29,223
He could care less about the 50,000 yen for it.

277
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:30,923
-Right. -Yep.

278
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:34,023
And the last words of Mr. Okura.

279
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:38,023
U... UFO...

280
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,323
Talking of UFO,

281
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,123
brings to mind that UFO research center.

282
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,623
Mannen and Iwabuchi realized that

283
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:47,123
it was the place where the treasure was hidden.

284
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,023
They snuck in last night

285
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:51,023
to snatch that treasure away, then found it.

286
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,623
And although they got a long as "brothers" Sadao Mannen

287
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:56,423
who wanted the treasure for himself

288
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:59,323
killed Osamu Iwabuchi.

289
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,323
So, that's what happened.

290
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:04,123
If so, everything falls into place.

291
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:06,123
But you know, it's not everything.

292
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,023
Sort of.

293
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:11,923
Yes, sir. What?

294
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,423
Yes, I understand!

295
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:15,223
What's up, Chiba?

296
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:16,223
It's from the Beika police

297
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,623
where I asked to have look for Sadao Mannen.

298
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:22,023
They found that he is in debt with the people he works with

299
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:25,623
and is still running from them.

300
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,123
If he got a hold of billions of cash,

301
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,223
he would've returned his debt first thing, wouldn't he?

302
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:32,623
Which means, the treasure hasn't been found yet?

303
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,723
That's the only thing plausible.

304
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,123
But, if so...

305
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:39,423
The deduction that Mannen killed Iwabuchi

306
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:41,823
to take everything for the himself wouldn't hold ground.

307
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,723
Sadao Mannen has no motive.

308
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,523
If so, who took Osamu Iwabuchi's life?

309
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,923
I see!

310
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,023
Hey, hey.

311
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,323
Mr. Mannen is a mysterious person, isn't he?

312
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,323
He didn't look for the money until he found it.

313
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:06,023
I wonder why he stopped partway?

314
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,523
Did he stop partway?

315
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:13,223
He moved the flying saucer out at 01:00, you know.

316
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,523
That's right.

317
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:15,923
Maybe something that made him have to

318
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:19,123
stop looking for the treasure happened?

319
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,423
An unforeseeable occurrence, did you call it?

320
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,023
An unforeseeable occurrence?

321
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,323
I wonder if that had anything to do with the wire

322
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:29,523
that was holding the UFO up on the ceiling breaking or something?

323
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,323
The wire that it was suspended by?

324
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,323
It was broken. Only the one that was rusty was?

325
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:36,823
Besides, Mr. Iwabuchi was crushed

326
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:40,223
by that flying saucer twice, wasn't he?

327
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:42,223
He died from the first crush

328
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:44,023
and was crushed once again after that, right?

329
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:45,623
An unforeseeable occurrence...

330
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:47,523
The wire that broke off...

331
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,323
Crushed twice...

332
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:53,923
And Sadao Mannen has no motive to kill Osamu Iwabuchi.

333
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:56,523
Right.

334
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,923
Most probably.

335
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:02,923
I see. This was not a homicide.

336
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,123
Yes.

337
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,223
Hey. Why isn't it a homicide?

338
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,723
I don't know.

339
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,523
The only thing I do know is that

340
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:13,323
the treasure is still hidden in that lab.

341
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,723
At any rate, let's go back to that lab.

342
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:19,023
Hey. You children should all go home.

343
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:20,223
But...

344
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:23,623
We left our things there.

345
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,923
Is that so?

346
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,823
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

347
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,423
How many trunks do you need to fill billions of yen?

348
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:33,723
It may not be cash.

349
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:35,423
It could be sticks of gold!

350
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,023
I don't mind you looking for it at all.

351
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,923
But when on earth did he hide it?

352
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:43,823
Mr. Okura never once came here, and yet...

353
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,623
What?

354
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,323
He never came?

355
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,823
But he came to sell the hanging scroll, didn't he?

356
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,123
No. He contacted me

357
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:55,223
and I went over to his place.

358
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:58,523
I heard rumors that you are developing flying saucers,

359
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:01,123
so I thought that the Heavens would punish me

360
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,823
if I didn't give this to you, Doctor.

361
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:08,423
It's as if it's been drawn just for me.

362
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:09,723
You think so too, don't you?

363
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,523
Please keep is as a household treasure.

364
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,623
50,000 yen will do!

365
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:17,523
And that's how I got a hold of this.

366
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:20,023
Kinji Okura didn't come here?

367
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:23,323
If not, he couldn't have hidden any treasure here, could he?

368
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:27,623
So that last word, "UFO" that Mr. Okura mentioned

369
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,523
was not about this place.

370
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:31,123
The odd couple mistakenly thought

371
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:33,823
that was what he meant and snuck in here.

372
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:38,023
If so, then why did Kinji Okura sell it?

373
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,523
To the point of calling him over,

374
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,323
for something like that...

375
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,923
So, that's the story.

376
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:51,323
It seems you've come up with something, haven't you?

377
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,823
Well, either way, that person Mannen

378
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,423
is probably going to come here tonight again

379
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,723
to look for the treasure, though.

380
00:18:57,723 --> 00:18:59,223
No.

381
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,523
I don't think he'll be able to wait till tonight.

382
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:08,623
I've got to give it back quickly

383
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:11,523
or I'll be in hot water.

384
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:14,123
Not home. Lucky!

385
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,423
Mr. Sadao Mannen?

386
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,723
You also snuck in here last night too, didn't you?

387
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:25,023
Together with your "kid brother" Iwabuchi

388
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:28,623
to look for Kinji Okura's hidden assets.

389
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:33,323
But some unforeseeable accident happened.

390
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,423
Yeah.

391
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:38,023
I'm sure it's here somewhere!

392
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,623
Because this is the only place with a UFO.

393
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:49,023
My only good suit...

394
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,423
Who cares! If we get hold of the money,

395
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,223
you can buy as much of that stuff as you want!

396
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:55,023
True, I guess so.

397
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,723
What?

398
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,323
Buchi?

399
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,923
Are you all right, Buchi?

400
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:05,523
Buchi!

401
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:11,423
He was completely crushed and died on the spot.

402
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:15,123
I knew it was rusty.

403
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:16,723
And I was going to buy a new one

404
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:18,323
after I got paid for my part-time job.

405
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:20,823
It was an accident, wasn't it?

406
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:24,223
You couldn't make yourself continue looking for the treasure.

407
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,223
You couldn't leave the corpse as it was either.

408
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:30,323
Because if the corpse is found in the morning,

409
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,323
the police would rush over here.

410
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,323
If Iwabuchi is found dead,

411
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,423
you, as his "big brother" would also

412
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:39,023
be suspected as having been together.

413
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:43,423
Besides, if the police find the treasure during site investigation,

414
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,123
everything would go down the drain.

415
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:48,323
In order for this not to happen, you devised a plan.

416
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:51,123
By moving both the corpse and the flying saucer using the truck,

417
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:53,223
you tried to make it look as if

418
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:56,223
Mr. Iwabuchi died at that dry riverbed

419
00:20:56,223 --> 00:21:00,023
to keep the eyes of the police away from this lab.

420
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,123
I was hoping that the crash landing of the UFO

421
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,623
would be thought the reason of his death.

422
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,723
But if you wanted to distract the eyes of the police,

423
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:10,223
there are other easy ways to do so, aren't there?

424
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:12,023
All you had to do was hide the corpse

425
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,723
where people wouldn't find it.

426
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,123
-I see. -If the corpse isn't found,

427
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,823
the police won't make any moves.

428
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,923
That won't do!

429
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:26,023
If he's not found, I can't give him a funeral, can I?

430
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,723
That would be too pathetic for Buchi.

431
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,623
But you understand, don't you?

432
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,723
You've committed several crimes.

433
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:41,623
Trespassing into this lab, dump job,

434
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:44,523
and stealing the UFO, a burglary charge.

435
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:49,323
I admit everything.

436
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:53,023
-Let's go. -Yes, sir.

437
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,323
That's right.

438
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:56,523
As for Mr. Okura's hidden asset,

439
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,523
there were jewels hidden in the shaft of the hanging scroll.

440
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:03,823
Mr. Okura's final word did not indicate the location,

441
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,023
but the UFO hanging scroll itself.

442
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:36,423
Now, I'll take you all home,

443
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:37,823
so go get your things.

444
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:40,323
-Huh? -What things?

445
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:45,323
We forgot to do our homework!

446
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,523
"Next Episode" -Is it buried treasure?

447
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:59,623
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

448
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:05,323
This is...

449
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:07,123
a pass ring for the mystery train.

450
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:17,523
Next Conan, "Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 1)"

451
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,023
Next Conan's Hint:

452
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:37,623
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano"

453
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:38,923
Hey, are you going to do it again?

454
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:40,123
I can't help it, can't I?

455
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:42,523
Well, I guess, you mean like this?
