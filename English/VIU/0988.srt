1
00:00:01,327 --> 00:00:03,837
Are we really doing this?

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:06,671
Yeah. After all, she's bad news.

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,551
If we're doing this, now's our chance.

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:12,511
But if someone finds out, we'll both be arrested.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:17,621
Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and I'll be the one to finish her off.

6
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:19,862
Got it. Let's do it, then.

7
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,831
Let's shop!

8
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:29,681
We're here for products available today only.

9
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,321
Clothes and accessories.

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,501
Let's get pumped!

11
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:34,592
Yeah...

12
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:36,691
Yeah!

13
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,722
Happy Seal, go, go!

14
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:42,472
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!

15
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:45,102
Happy Seal, go, go!

16
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:48,061
This is the current top lovely toy!

17
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,352
The number one soothing-type toy!

18
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:53,091
Such a wonderful partner!

19
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:55,282
He'll always be with you!

20
00:00:56,132 --> 00:01:00,452
He laughs, he cries, he sleeps, he wakes up, and he dances beautifully!

21
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:03,962
You can control him using the smartphone app!

22
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,452
Happy Seal, go, go!

23
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,462
Huh, so it's a seal toy.

24
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:18,392
Ow...

25
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:23,222
I'm really sorry suddenly asking you to take some time off for us.

26
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:27,801
It's fine. We're much obliged to your father.

27
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:28,587
Here you are.

28
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,321
Thank you.

29
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:35,272
Sonoko-san, if you'd only asked, we would have set aside some limited products for you.

30
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,261
That's not good enough.

31
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:38,932
I have to get it myself in order to—

32
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:42,281
Ayaka-chan, hurry up and move some stuff.

33
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:46,662
What? But I just painted my nails.

34
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,450
See?

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,500
It's those girls from earlier.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,439
Find the question that solves the mystery!

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,719
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,579
A secret battle between a group of girls!

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,569
A case breaks out backstage!

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,239
Always determining the one truth

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,019
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,970
his name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,780
The Feuding Girls

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,290
You knew from the start that we'd be carrying stuff.

45
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:04,271
Sorry, but I won an audition for a commercial.

46
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,052
I need to look pretty.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,679
Mai, you were rejected, weren't you?

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,990
That's too bad.

49
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,580
Ayaka-chan!

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,080
Oh, please. You're both scowling.

51
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,500
Mai?

52
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,029
I'll leave this stuff here.

53
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,430
Ayaka-san, help carry something.

54
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,879
Mina-san, can I take tomorrow off?

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,249
I'd like to practice for my commercial.

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,469
Hold on. You can't suddenly ask for the day off.

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,900
Right, Yuko-chan?

58
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,159
She's right.

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,209
And besides, if you work hard on this job,

60
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,119
you might get an even better offer next time.

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,309
That's right.

62
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,790
But wouldn't trying hard on the commercial get me an even better job than this one?

63
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,219
Ayaka, are you making fun of this job?

64
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,170
Mina-san!

65
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,839
Yeah, yeah.

66
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,510
I get it.

67
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,829
Ayaka-san, you're acting a little strange today.

68
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,059
Try to be more considerate of the others.

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,739
Just ignore her.

70
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,609
She doesn't want to do this tough low-paying job anymore.

71
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,350
But...

72
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,089
What are you doing?

73
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,769
Jeez, you're clumsy.

74
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,699
Ayaka! You did that on purpose, didn't you?

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,699
What? On purpose?

76
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,530
How could you say that?

77
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:30,990
Don't be ridiculous!

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,240
Ow! What was that for?

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,750
Please stop, both of you!

80
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,579
Let's try to get along while we're working on this campaign, okay?

81
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,500
God, you're so annoying!

82
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,890
I-I'm sorry!

83
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,099
Did we get any on you?

84
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,219
I'm fine.

85
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
I'm really sorry.

86
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,959
The limited products go on sale soon, Sonoko.

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,740
Yeah. It was worth standing in line for thirty minutes.

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,919
What are you spacing out for?

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,080
Ow!

90
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,350
What was that?

91
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,270
What's wrong?

92
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,190
A-Ayaka is...

93
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,259
She's gone.

94
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,450
No way. Ayaka?

95
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,769
Did she fall from there?

96
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,489
What is it, kid?

97
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,689
Conan-kun?

98
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,110
Call the police, Ran-neechan.

99
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,330
Okay.

100
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,130
What's this?

101
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,049
The estimated time of death is around 2:30PM.

102
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,919
This storage room within a shopping mall where the crime took place

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,470
happens to be under construction.

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,230
The victim Saijo Ayaka-san seems to have fallen from the construction scaffolding.

105
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,739
I see.

106
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,699
Which means this was an accident.

107
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,610
Actually, about that...

108
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,869
There were signs that the scaffolding the victim fell from had been tampered with.

109
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,660
What? Which means this could be a murder?

110
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,920
And? Who are these three?

112
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,829
They're colleagues of the late Ayaka-san.

113
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,669
Fukamoto Mai-san discovered the body.

114
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,239
I see. Could you describe the circumstances under which you found her?

115
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,269
Come to think of it, everyone was arguing with Ayaka-san.

116
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,850
Hey, Conan-kun!

117
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,959
Is that true, Ran-san?

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,940
Yes, I suppose.

119
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,520
I see.

120
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,199
Please don't do this.

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,969
It's true that we argued with Ayaka.

122
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,819
But it's not possible.

123
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,519
We wouldn't kill Ayaka.

124
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,780
Th-That's right.

125
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,790
Then where were you around 2:30PM when Ayaka-san died?

126
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,819
Well...

127
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,219
I was...

128
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,300
I was here preparing for the sale this afternoon along with the staff.

129
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,800
And? What about you two?

130
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:42,109
I was actually skipping work to watch the concert going on in the event space.

131
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,369
Mina-san...

132
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,430
Sorry.

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,289
I see.

134
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,050
What about you?

135
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,360
Actually, we found this in the garbage can in the hallway.

136
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,679
"Dear Mai, sorry about earlier. I got carried away."

137
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,870
"I'd like to apologize, so please come to floor 2, section 3 of the storage room around 3PM."

138
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,440
"From Ayaka."

139
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,380
Th-That's...

140
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,880
Also, we also found this at the crime scene.

141
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,640
That's Mai-san's...

142
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,199
Are you certain this is yours?

143
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,789
Y-Yes, b-but...

144
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,390
Is this what happened, then?

145
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,609
Mai-san received a letter from Ayaka-san saying she wanted to apologize.

146
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,659
She secretly went to the storage room and broke the scaffolding.

147
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,410
Then she feigned innocence and met Ayaka-san on the second floor of the storage room.

148
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,289
But she dropped her brooch then.

149
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,080
You're wrong!

150
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,330
I didn't do that!

151
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,919
It's true that I went to the storage room.

152
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,840
Ayaka said she wanted to apologize...

153
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,229
But I didn't do it!

154
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,579
By the time I went, Ayaka was already dead!

155
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,340
You have to believe me!

156
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,120
Don't do that, Conan-kun.

157
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,209
You shouldn't wander around the crime scene.

158
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,120
Sorry.

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Ran-neechan, doesn't this seem the other way around?

160
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,790
The other way around?

161
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah. It was Ayaka-san who asked Mai-san to come here.

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,430
But Mai-san is thought to have tampered with the scaffolding.

163
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,690
Normally wouldn't the person who did the tampering invite their victim here?

164
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,490
Now that you mention it, you're right.

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,940
But that would mean...

166
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,989
That marks where Mai-san's brooch fell, right?

167
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,740
Yeah, probably.

168
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,729
But if it's the other way around, then...

169
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,450
Watch out!

170
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,080
Are you okay, Ran-neechan?

171
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,890
Yeah. Thanks, Conan-kun.

172
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,679
That was close.

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,070
The belt holding it in place is loose.

174
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,060
What's this?

175
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,990
That's Ayaka-san's...

176
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,669
Did you find something?

177
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,470
Yeah.

178
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,860
Hey, you!

179
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,569
You can't come in here! It's off limits!

180
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,459
Sorry.

181
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,530
Hey, mister.

182
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,539
The belt around these boxes is loose. They're about to fall over.

183
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,580
It's what?

184
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,689
Damn it. Must've been those part-timers.

185
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,330
I'll have to give them a talking to later.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,460
Those? There's more than one of them?

187
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,919
Yeah.

188
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,880
One of them lifts boxes using that crane,

189
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,260
and the other stacks and secures them in place.

190
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,260
It takes at least two people.

191
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,480
Two people?

192
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,859
I told you, that brooch has been missing since a few days ago!

193
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,020
I've been looking for it!

194
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,149
But you tried to hide the letter.

195
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,190
Because I didn't want to become a suspect!

196
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,009
I heard you were the runner-up at an audition for a commercial.

197
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,200
If something happened to Ayaka-san...

198
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,960
N-No. I didn't do it!

199
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,210
What? You want to confirm my alibi?

200
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,590
Yeah. Do you know who Mori Kogoro is?

201
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,929
The great detective.

202
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,930
He wants to know.

203
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,600
Yuko-chan was in the green room with me when it happened.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
So you didn't go to that storage room.

205
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,980
Nope. I haven't been there once this afternoon.

206
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,490
Detective Mori is asking about my alibi?

207
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,539
Yeah. You said you went to watch the concert.

208
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,500
He was wondering if there was anyone who could vouch for you.

209
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,239
I know the receptionist.

210
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,910
You should ask her about it.

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,620
They both have alibis.

212
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,410
I guess it's not related after all.

213
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,210
But...

214
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,539
Conan-kun, there you are.

215
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,019
We're leaving.

216
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,010
Okay.

217
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:46,789
No. I didn't do it!

218
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,890
I didn't push Ayaka!

219
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,900
Now, now. You can tell us the rest at the station.

220
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,150
I see. So that's how it is.

221
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,455
Please believe me!

222
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,056
I really didn't do it!

223
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,806
In any case, you can tell us the rest at—

224
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,056
Sonoko?

225
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,566
Are you okay, Sonoko-neechan?

226
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,455
I'm fine.

227
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:32,945
I'm just feeling a little dizzy because I figured it all out.

228
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:33,876
What?

229
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,696
Y-You know who did it?

230
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,245
Yes, that's right.

231
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:38,455
In order to confirm my suspicions,

232
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:42,706
could you go up to the second floor where Ayaka-san fell, Detective Takagi?

233
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,966
What are you having Takagi-kun confirm?

234
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:52,045
There were two tricks set up inside this storage room.

235
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,716
Two tricks?

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:59,726
The first was applied to the scaffolding that made Ayaka-san fall.

237
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,285
And the second was...

238
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,226
Sonoko-san.

239
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:04,905
I've arrived.

240
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:07,485
See the boxes stacked there?

241
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,836
Don't they seem unsteady, like they're about to fall over?

242
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:14,085
You're right. It's dangerous.

243
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:17,366
And where was Mai-san's brooch?

244
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,116
In front of the boxes.

245
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:22,395
What about that, Sonoko-kun?

246
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:27,376
Detective Takagi, could you look at the clasp on the belt securing those boxes?

247
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:31,525
There's some kind of paint or something on it.

248
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,846
Is there anything on the floor nearby?

249
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,056
I found something!

250
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:39,906
What is this?

251
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,056
Is it an artificial nail?

252
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:46,076
That's Ayaka's.

253
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:51,316
The body was missing one of its nails.

254
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:52,606
In other words,

255
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:57,446
based on what we just confirmed and Mai-san's testimony relating to her brooch...

256
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,135
I told you, that brooch has been missing since a few days ago!

257
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,456
I've been looking for it!

258
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:07,295
And in conjunction with the letter Ayaka-san wrote to Mai-san...

259
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:07,876
That's it!

260
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:12,216
Ayaka-san stole Mai-san's brooch and left it here.

261
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,575
She summoned Mai-san here with that letter

262
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:19,596
and planned to send her and the scaffolding crashing to the floor by knocking over the boxes.

263
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:21,726
No...

264
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,706
Ayaka was going to kill me?

265
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:28,565
But something made her lose her footing on the scaffolding she tampered with

266
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,135
and she fell.

267
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:31,076
Wrong.

268
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:31,986
What?

269
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:33,736
Th-That's wrong?

270
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:37,986
Boxes can't be stacked on the second floor without two people.

271
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:43,246
One lifts the boxes using the crane, while the other stacks them up.

272
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:47,126
In other words, someone was controlling the crane.

273
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:53,256
An evil seal who incited Ayaka-san and got her caught up in this murder plot.

274
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,905
They incited Ayaka-san?

275
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,506
Yes. For example...

276
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:02,595
"She's planning to injure you and steal your commercial job."

277
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:05,266
"She did the same thing to me before and took one of mine."

278
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:09,466
"At this rate, she'll continue to escalate, and harm the two of us."

279
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,276
"We should kill Mai-san together."

280
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:17,776
Then the evil seal instructed Ayaka-san to do the following.

281
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,035
"Write a letter to Mai-san inviting her to the storage room."

282
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:25,286
"Leave this brooch I stole from her in front of the boxes."

283
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:30,625
"Once Mai-san comes to the second floor, she'll spot her brooch and approach."

284
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:34,525
"Then I'll push the boxes onto her from behind, and she'll fall."

285
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:36,355
"It'll look like an accident."

286
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,726
"During that time, you'll go fabricate an alibi."

287
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:46,525
I see. But it was Ayaka-san, not Mai-san, who ended up dead.

288
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:49,155
Something must've made her fall from the scaffolding she tampered with.

289
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,706
You're wrong, Inspector Megure.

290
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:55,515
It was the evil seal who tampered with the scaffolding.

291
00:17:55,516 --> 00:18:00,145
Ayaka-san climbed the scaffolding without realizing that and fell.

292
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:00,826
What?

293
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:07,206
The true goal of this murder plot was to kill Ayaka-san.

294
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:14,135
But if killing Ayaka-san was their only goal,

295
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,256
why bother with this troublesome trick?

296
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,915
This trick was bait meant to draw in Ayaka-san.

297
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,926
Bait?

298
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,225
If they had invited Ayaka-san here with the intention of murdering her,

299
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:28,116
it could have left behind evidence,

300
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:32,566
or Ayaka-san herself could have told someone about it.

301
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:37,875
But by luring Ayaka-san into a fake plot to murder Mai-san,

302
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:40,805
they didn't have to worry about her telling anyone.

303
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:44,595
Furthermore, the odds that suspicion would fall on the evil seal

304
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,576
would be reduced to nearly nothing.

305
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:47,945
That's it!

306
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:52,485
The letter to Mai-san was proof of their quarrel,

307
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:57,406
and as the first person to discover the body, suspicion would fall on Mai-san first.

308
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:03,846
And the brooch at the crime scene would seem like evidence that Mai-san was the culprit.

309
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,745
But, Sonoko-kun, how did this evil seal get Ayaka-san

310
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:14,065
to climb the scaffolding that had been tampered with?

311
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,606
Well... Conan-kun?

312
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:16,976
Here.

313
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,486
Wow, there are lots of stuffed seals.

314
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:24,515
Stuffed seals?

315
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,486
What about them?

316
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:30,885
Those stuffed animals can apparently be controlled using a smartphone.

317
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:31,866
So...

318
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:36,495
They told Ayaka-san exactly when to place the brooch there,

319
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,026
and at that time...

320
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:49,886
Excuse me.

321
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:52,605
In order to control those stuffed animals,

322
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,955
you need to register it on your phone.

323
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:56,975
That's right.

324
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,805
The stuffed animals over there haven't been sold yet,

325
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:01,395
so they can't be controlled using a phone.

326
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:02,816
Huh?

327
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,236
This seal has a stain on it.

328
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,236
Is it a coffee stain?

329
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:14,746
Ran, do you remember what happened when we were in the green room?

330
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,956
God, you're so annoying!

331
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,345
Yuko...

332
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,836
Did you...?

333
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:30,346
Yuko-san, you said you hadn't been here once all afternoon.

334
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,266
So why is that stuffed animal here?

335
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:40,906
And if we examine your phone, we'll find that stuffed animal registered to it.

336
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:48,986
She stole the man I loved and tossed him aside.

337
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:52,746
He killed himself because of it.

338
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,876
So I avenged him.

339
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:00,246
B-But why frame me?

340
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,625
I'm sorry, Mai-san.

341
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,756
It could've been anyone.

342
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:09,116
Anyone who might've argued with her.

343
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:11,855
Are we really doing this?

344
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,765
Yeah. After all, she's bad news.

345
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:16,625
If we're doing this, now's our chance.

346
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:20,605
But if someone finds out, we'll both be arrested.

347
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:25,546
Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and I'll be the one to finish her off.

348
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:29,276
Got it. Let's kill Mai, then.

349
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:34,286
First, you'll trip me in front of everyone.

350
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,215
After making Mai angry,

351
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:39,615
I'll send her a letter saying I want to apologize

352
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,726
and have her come to the storage room.

353
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,195
Here you go.

354
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:10,756
Thank you.

355
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,145
They're flying off the shelves.

356
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,255
Thank you.

357
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:16,516
Thank you for even putting on the idol outfit.

358
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,265
Don't worry about it.

359
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,015
Impressive as always, Ran-neechan.

360
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:25,016
Sonoko-san, thank you for helping, too.

361
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,235
You're welcome.

362
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,026
This costume sure is hot.

363
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:33,845
I'm impressed, Detective Queen Sonoko.

364
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,615
You look good in anything.

365
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,575
You're next, kid. Here!

366
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,036
Wait, wait, wait!
