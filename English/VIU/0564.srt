1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,383
"Teito Bank."

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:05,283
Since Mitsuhiko wanted to deposit his New year's allowance,

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:08,383
we all kept him company and came to the Teito Bank.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,983
However, Genta comes down with a stomachache

5
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:13,583
from eating too much rice cake.

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,483
While waiting for Doc and Haibara to come back

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,683
after buying stomachache medicine,

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,783
the rest of us take Genta to the men's room, but...

9
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,083
What's going on?

10
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:26,683
The bank was suddenly taken over

11
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,783
by men wearing masks.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,683
FBI agent Jodie coincidentally happened to be among the people

13
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:36,983
who are taken hostage in the bank.

14
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,383
She succeeds in knocking down one of the robbers

15
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,483
after luring him into the restroom.

16
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,483
But she is stung with a stun gun by the robbers

17
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,983
and passes out.

18
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,483
We come to a point where we figure

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,983
that the only choice we have is

20
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,883
to beat the robbers up ourselves.

21
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:57,083
It seems that they still have something up their sleeves,

22
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,783
but we'll nab them for sure.

23
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:04,283
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,883
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,883
A vicious battle with bank robbers.

26
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,883
What are they really after?

27
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:12,483
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:14,383
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:16,683
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:02,941
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Silence."

31
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:23,772
This foreign lady sure was a fox.

32
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,572
We could kill her off now,

33
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:30,372
but we don't want the cops hearing the gun shot

34
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:31,772
and storming in here.

35
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:32,872
Okay.

36
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,972
Right...

37
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:40,872
I got the money ready.

38
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,072
So could you please open the case?

39
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,472
Hey... is that it?

40
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:50,472
I'll bet you have a lot more stashed in a larger safe?

41
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,572
If you like, I can blow this place up

42
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,372
using explosives, you know!

43
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:59,272
Just be quiet and do what's written on this paper.

44
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,172
If you make noise,

45
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,772
I'm going to bust through your head.

46
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,172
Okay!

47
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:08,272
All those with no friends or acquaintances here,

48
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:12,272
come here and cover your eyes and mouth with masking tape!

49
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:15,172
We'll tie both your hands for you, get that?

50
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,672
Oh, it's me.

51
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:36,172
How's it on that side?

52
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,572
What the... did you regain consciousness?

53
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,172
Yeah.

54
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,972
But, my head's still dizzy

55
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:44,372
and I don't think I can walk alone yet.

56
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,872
I wish give me a hand here.

57
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:49,572
Okay.

58
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,572
Hang on.

59
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,272
Huh? What's up?

60
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,072
That guy woke up.

61
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,572
I'm going to go get him,

62
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,272
so take care of things here, will you.

63
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,372
Hurry, we don't have much time.

64
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:02,372
Yeah.

65
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:07,572
"Restroom."

66
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,272
Hey... you're still passed out.

67
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,072
What was that phone call a while ago, then?

68
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:18,772
Maybe he called from dreamland?

69
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:22,572
To let you know that a bank robbery

70
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,272
is something really not worth doing.

71
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,372
You brat, where'd you...

72
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,272
Hey, hold it!

73
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,272
Hold it!

74
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,672
You'd better hold it!

75
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:38,272
Or I'm going to kill you!

76
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:47,072
How is it, Conan?

77
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:50,372
Yeah, he passed out from a concussion.

78
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:53,372
Let's tie him up while we can with the toilet hose.

79
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,672
We did it!

80
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,972
Project toilet paper worked out great!

81
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:02,572
It sure was worth laying toilet paper all over the floor!

82
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,172
The tranquilizer gun is the ace in the hole,

83
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:05,872
I've got to save it for later.

84
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,872
Conan, what next?

85
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:11,472
What else?

86
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,772
We're going to call the other men

87
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,472
using his cell phone.

88
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,172
Because the number which displayed in the call history

89
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,372
right before the call I made

90
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,772
is the number of the other guy.

91
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,272
Oh, it's me.

92
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:26,772
How're things on that side?

93
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:29,072
What do you mean how are things?

94
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,372
Didn't I just tell you on the phone a while ago

95
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,672
that I was going to the beauty shop?

96
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,872
Because we're dating tonight, right?

97
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,272
Right, see you later then.

98
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:41,472
This guy called his girlfriend

99
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,772
just before committing the crime.

100
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,472
Gotta find another one...

101
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,972
All the other numbers

102
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:51,772
are mostly of the guy who's passed out in the restroom.

103
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:54,072
Hey Conan, what's up?

104
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,972
You've got to hurry and call him out!

105
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:58,972
He was saying something about not having enough time too.

106
00:06:58,972 --> 00:06:59,972
Time?

107
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,572
We don't have much time.

108
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,472
Let's take off his mask and jacket

109
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,372
and seat him on the toilet seat.

110
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,372
What time is he talking about?

111
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,272
Are they going to be picked up by somebody?

112
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,672
Besides...

113
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:15,872
They're separating the customers,

114
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,172
putting all the friends and acquaintances together.

115
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,972
And they made the branch manager put the cash in the trunk alone.

116
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,772
Why did they divide the customers?

117
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,772
Why did they make the branch manager

118
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:27,672
put the cash in the trunk alone?

119
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:31,272
In the first place, why isn't this guy wearing a mask?

120
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,272
If the police charge in here,

121
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:34,272
his face would readily be exposed...

122
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,972
Don't tell me...

123
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:44,772
I'm done.

124
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,072
I see.

125
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,072
Good work.

126
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,672
Talk about taking forever.

127
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,072
The guy who went to get the man

128
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,372
who passed out in the men's room.

129
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:01,072
Five minutes have already gone by.

130
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,672
Let him be, we don't have time.

131
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:09,172
We've got to start finishing up the job!

132
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,172
"Teito Bank."

133
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:21,572
Everything is prepared, sir.

134
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:24,472
We're ready to go in!

135
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:25,872
Anytime!

136
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,172
Okay!

137
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,872
The technical backup team and control team

138
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,472
be ready to take action anytime!

139
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:35,272
-Roger! -Did the robbers make any demands?

140
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:36,572
Nothing, yet.

141
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:37,972
We've been trying to call for some time now

142
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,572
to the telephone inside the bank,

143
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:41,572
but the line's been busy.

144
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,572
Busy?

145
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:49,472
I'm sure that the police outside are wondering about us,

146
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:52,172
because we haven't made any demands yet.

147
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:55,172
But why didn't you just pull out the telephone line?

148
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:58,772
It's better that way.

149
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,472
It's better to make them think

150
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:03,972
that we're calling somebody, somewhere

151
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,572
and making demands.

152
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:09,872
That way we can keep them hesitating to charge in.

153
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,972
The guy who went to pick the other guy up in the toilet

154
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:14,372
hasn't come back yet.

155
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,972
Maybe he went weak in the hips

156
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,172
and can't bring him back alone?

157
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:21,172
The guy who's passed out is pretty fat too.

158
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:22,672
No problem.

159
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,172
You were given orders to do things right

160
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:28,972
just in case something out of the ordinary happened too, weren't you?

161
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,472
Besides...

162
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:34,072
this peppy foreign lady

163
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:38,672
who knocked that guy out in the restroom...

164
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:41,672
also going to cross over to the other world soon anyway.

165
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,472
You figured it out?

166
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,072
You mean you figured out what the robbers are after?

167
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:51,072
Yeah.

168
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,672
These robbers are probably...

169
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,672
going to disguise themselves as the hostages here

170
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,972
and make it out of this bank.

171
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:03,972
Disguise themselves as the hostages?

172
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,772
But, how?

173
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,172
You saw the robbers all dressed alike, right?

174
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,872
Yes.

175
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:14,472
Even the man who was knocked out in the restroom by Jodie.

176
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,972
And the guy who stung Jodie

177
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:19,572
with the stun gun and made her faint.

178
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,572
They all had the same mask on

179
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:24,272
and wore the same jacket.

180
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:27,572
The guy who was passed out in the restroom

181
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:29,572
was stripped of his clothes and mask

182
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,272
by the other robbers, right?

183
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:34,672
And the guy who came to pick him up

184
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:36,672
removed his as well.

185
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:37,872
In other words,

186
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,672
they're choosing five hostages,

187
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,572
the same number to cover themselves,

188
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,472
and fainting them with their stun guns.

189
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,872
After that, the robbers dress the hostages

190
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,072
as if they were themselves,

191
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:50,972
they plan to make their escape.

192
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:54,072
But, won't they be found out immediately?

193
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,072
Nope.

194
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,272
Since both of Jodie's hands, her eyes and mouth

195
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:00,872
were tied and covered with masking tape,

196
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:03,772
I'm sure the same goes for the other hostages.

197
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:04,772
I see!

198
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:07,172
If they can't see,

199
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,572
they wouldn't know what the bad guys are doing.

200
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:09,572
Yeah.

201
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,772
And besides, the fact that the robbers

202
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,472
were separating the hostages into those who had friends with them

203
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,372
and those who came alone,

204
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,972
is only further proof of that.

205
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,572
If the robbers choose five people from the hostages who came alone

206
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:23,872
and dress them up like robbers,

207
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,372
when all is over and done,

208
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,872
even if the five perish, no one would say anything.

209
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:32,072
Perish after all is over and done?

210
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,572
Why?

211
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:36,672
Why do you think the robbers made the branch manager alone

212
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:40,172
gather all the money there is in this bank,

213
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:43,072
and put it in the case that they brought along?

214
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:46,972
Isn't it because he knows most about this bank?

215
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,272
In most branches of small banks like this,

216
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:51,572
a hundred million yen is left in a place

217
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,672
where the cash is easily accessible,

218
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,672
and 200 million yen in the ATM.

219
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,072
There is usually a total of 300 million yen in cash.

220
00:11:57,072 --> 00:12:00,172
To collect all that and to stuff it in a case alone

221
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,272
requires quite a lot of time.

222
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,872
Then, why did they make him do it alone?

223
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:08,672
They had no intention to put it in the case to begin with.

224
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,072
The content of the case is probably...

225
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,472
a bomb.

226
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,872
A bomb...

227
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,686
"Teito Bank."

228
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,286
A bomb...

229
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,086
just what do you mean?

230
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:34,619
The case with bombs will be put behind the counter.

231
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,482
And after the robbers put five hostages,

232
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:39,982
branch manager and Jodie to sleep,

233
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,882
they'll scatter the money that the branch manager had taken out

234
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,482
and set off the bombs.

235
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:44,582
The only thing left after the explosion

236
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:46,882
are the seven dead people

237
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,582
and money that is scattered all over.

238
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,282
To the police who enter the scene after the explosion,

239
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,382
it would look like the robbers tried to open the safe using explosives,

240
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,182
but it accidentally went off.

241
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:59,782
And the robbers who were carrying the explosives

242
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:02,982
got the branch manager and Jodie involved and exploded to death.

243
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,482
It would look like the crime didn't work out as planned.

244
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:07,882
Which means that the robbers...

245
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:11,482
had no intention of stealing cash?

246
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,582
Wrong.

247
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,082
They probably made the branch manager deposit a large sum of money

248
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:18,482
into a certain bank account by internet,

249
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:22,182
and are planning to later forward it to their own account.

250
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,082
An account some place abroad

251
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:25,682
where Japan won't be able to touch.

252
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,782
An intellectual crime?

253
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:30,582
No, they're a bunch of super amateurs.

254
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:33,982
Even if a total of 300 million yen were to be wired

255
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:36,582
to a foreign country from this bank,

256
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,682
any amount of cash exceeding five million yen that isn't accounted

257
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,782
will be stopped by law

258
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,982
at the foreign exchange center.

259
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:49,182
Some time ago, it was different,

260
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,682
but since there have been a lot of swindling

261
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,282
and money laundering in recent years,

262
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:57,782
they probably planned robbing this bank sometime in the past,

263
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,682
because it took them quite a number of months

264
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:02,782
to get the members and weapons together.

265
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:06,282
Which means their plan was meant to fail to begin with?

266
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,382
They sure are stupid.

267
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,782
But, their guns are for real.

268
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,882
The explosion is probably also.

269
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:17,482
If we take them lightly,

270
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,682
we can't bust in there and nab them, you know.

271
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:22,182
Bust in there?

272
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:23,582
How?

273
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:25,982
Are you going to shoot them with that gun?

274
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,982
No, I'm just going to keep this for them.

275
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:30,582
I won't shoot.

276
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:32,682
Well, I guess when we bust in there,

277
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:33,982
we'll do it outright openly.

278
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:35,282
What...

279
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:38,582
There are still three robbers left, you know.

280
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,282
They'll shoot us.

281
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,082
Don't worry.

282
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,482
When that time comes,

283
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,782
they won't be able to see us.

284
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,482
That time?

285
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:52,282
I'm sure that they'll shout the following to the hostages.

286
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:56,082
Darn! Let's just blow up the entire safe!

287
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,582
Come on and help, you guys!

288
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,282
They're making their move.

289
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:02,882
Shout?

290
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,482
You mean like now?

291
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:05,882
Yeah.

292
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:09,782
Ayumi, you keep the door of the elevator open and wait.

293
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:12,582
Genta, take the cart that is left in front of the elevator

294
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,582
to the counter where the hostages are gathered.

295
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,482
Mitsuhiko and I will go there ahead of you.

296
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,482
All right.

297
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,682
You can count on me.

298
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:22,982
Listen. Work quickly without making a sound.

299
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,282
Quick...

300
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,082
Hey, Conan.

301
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,782
Are you sure it's going to work?

302
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,482
They're all hostages

303
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,082
and none of the robbers are here.

304
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,182
I see.

305
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:49,082
In order to make themselves look like hostages,

306
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,882
they have their eyes and mouth covered with masking tape too,

307
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,582
so they can't see us.

308
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,282
Here goes.

309
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,282
Just as I thought, a little more than two minutes to go before explosion.

310
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,082
That's more than enough time.

311
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:20,882
Hey, Conan, I brought the cart.

312
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,582
Put this on top.

313
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,482
Ayumi, wait outside.

314
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:48,282
There was a strange sound just now.

315
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,382
Confirm what is was on the double.

316
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,382
-Yes, sir. -Something must've happened.

317
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,782
We somehow made it in time.

318
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,782
We were lucky it didn't explode right away.

319
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:06,282
It wasn't luck.

320
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:08,482
If they're going to fake being hostage,

321
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:10,082
they'll have to cover their eyes and mouths

322
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,082
as well as tie their hands behind them.

323
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,882
The guy who yelled a while ago,

324
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:19,282
after doing so, had to use his mouth to tie both his hands,

325
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:21,882
then go over to where the hostages were.

326
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,182
Then after covering his eyes and mouth,

327
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:26,782
had to pull his wrists inside the two arms that are tied

328
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:28,782
and then pull his legs through,

329
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:32,382
so that both his arms would be behind him.

330
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,582
If they hadn't left plenty of time to do that,

331
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:35,882
they wouldn't be at ease.

332
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:39,082
They figured that three minutes was enough.

333
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:42,582
But, why did they use a time bomb?

334
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:43,882
If they used a remote controlled bomb,

335
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:47,082
they could make it explode when they want to.

336
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,182
But they can't throw the controller

337
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:50,282
to a far distance

338
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,282
with both hand tied behind them.

339
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,782
I see.

340
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,782
But, how are they going to find the culprits

341
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,182
from among these people?

342
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,682
It's easy.

343
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,882
All we got to do is use their voice and say this...

344
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:11,882
Okay! Everybody stand up

345
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,082
and slowly walk towards the direction of my voice!

346
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,482
Understand? Slowly now!

347
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:21,182
Don't trip over the person in front of you!

348
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,682
Hey...

349
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,882
How can you tell...

350
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,782
I was told of this.

351
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:40,282
Was something changed?

352
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:43,282
This must be a mistake.

353
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,582
So, you three are the culprits?

354
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,882
The robbers themselves are the only ones who won't move

355
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:52,582
because something that wasn't planned was voiced.

356
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:59,382
Okay! First remove the masking tape of the bank man,

357
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:00,882
have him open the door.

358
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,082
Yep...

359
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,082
When the riot police come in take these three

360
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:07,282
and the guy that's tied up in the corridor,

361
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,982
as well as the guy who's passed out in the restroom...

362
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:13,282
Just who is passed out?

363
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,282
Conan...

364
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:18,982
That foreign lady and this brat,

365
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,282
what're with them anyway?

366
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,282
Shoots...

367
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,582
I guess the explosion a while ago woke him up.

368
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,682
Hey! You brats over there!

369
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,882
If you don't want me to break his neck,

370
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,782
go in the counter and bring the guns over!

371
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,382
I'm besieging this place.

372
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,782
I'm taking you to hell with me.

373
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,782
What's this?

374
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,482
You've already got it.

375
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:49,482
I guess you'll have to die.

376
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,482
Who is it? Who fired?

377
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,082
Is it Jodie?

378
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:26,082
The riot police heard the gun shot

379
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:27,882
and burst in.

380
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:31,682
The robbers were arrested in no time at all.

381
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,582
"Teito Bank" -I'm glad you're all okay.

382
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,882
Well, it's just natural outcome.

383
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:05,482
Conan and a FBI agent were there.

384
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:09,782
No. This time...

385
00:22:09,782 --> 00:22:12,382
It's thanks to the Youth Detective Squad.

386
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:17,482
-Well... -We didn't do that much.

387
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:19,282
We sure did a lot.

388
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:22,682
It's been bothering me for a while.

389
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:25,982
Jodie, you're an English teacher, aren't you?

390
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:28,482
Since when did you become a FBI agent?

391
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,882
That...

392
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,082
Don't tell me that you're just acting like you're one?

393
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:39,782
Genta, you pretend to be Kamen Yaiba a lot, don't you?

394
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:42,482
Right, I'm just pretending.

395
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:44,982
I see!

396
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,182
What's the matter?

397
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,982
You don't look happy.

398
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:50,982
I was just wondering

399
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:53,182
who shot at the culprit towards the end.

400
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:57,282
Jodie was passed out.

401
00:22:57,282 --> 00:22:59,782
Was there anybody there

402
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:01,182
who could shoot in the condition he was in?

403
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,182
Shu?

404
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,582
Didn't you see him?

405
00:23:08,582 --> 00:23:10,282
He was among the hostages, wasn't he?

406
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:17,082
You had it tough, didn't you, Jodie?

407
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:18,682
We were at that liquor store till a while ago,

408
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:20,482
so we weren't aware of anything.

409
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,582
And? Who was there?

410
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:26,582
Well...

411
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:28,582
Shuichi Akai died, you know!

412
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:31,782
Don't ever say that name again!

413
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,482
Is anything the matter?

414
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,082
No, it's nothing.

415
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:42,482
Just forget what I said.

416
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,882
"Next Episode."

417
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:00,182
What the...

418
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,382
Did anyone come out from here?

419
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,682
Nobody came out!

420
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:09,282
You mean there was murder right behind me?

421
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,482
How dare to make light of me!

422
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,882
Poison seems to have been put on the tip of the arrow.

423
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:16,582
I saw that person a while ago!

424
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,082
I've figured it out,

425
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,182
that person's the culprit!

426
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:23,782
Next Conan,

427
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:30,482
"The Witness Who Didn't See."

428
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:42,442
One, two!

429
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:44,566
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,491
"Wig."

431
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,616
The title of the next episode is a bit strange.

432
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,616
You've gotta watch.
