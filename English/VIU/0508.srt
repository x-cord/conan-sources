1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,318
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,718
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:06,717
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:09,217
High school girl Sonoko's deduction puts Kogoro to shame!

5
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,817
Solve the mystery of the missing weapon!

6
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:12,217
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:13,917
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,817
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,036
Eisuke Hondo who had been in the custody of the FBI

10
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,136
involving the case of Rena Mizunashi returns.

11
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,436
A suspicious man tails all of us who go to a karaoke shop

12
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:09,336
to celebrate Eisuke coming back to school.

13
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:15,436
Could he be a FBI agent who is watching and protecting Eisuke?

14
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:20,036
But that man is killed in a room of the karaoke shop.

15
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:24,736
The killer is among the customers who have come to the karaoke shop.

16
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,636
Don't tell me that Eisuke...

17
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:34,636
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop ( Part 2 )"

18
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,535
Then, let's start

19
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:49,436
-with Mr. Kunio Tamai who was in room number 1. -Yes.

20
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,436
"Kunio Tamai (63)" -I came here today

21
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:53,436
on my way home from fishing.

22
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:57,336
Oh, you came to this karaoke shop alone after fishing?

23
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:59,236
Is anything wrong with that?

24
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,736
You've fished quite a lot of fish.

25
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:14,436
To be honest, I bought most of the fish at the supermarket.

26
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,236
I was careless and my fishing rod drifted away.

27
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,436
But I promised my family that I would fish a lot of fish.

28
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,736
So having no other choice I went to buy the fish.

29
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:31,736
It's true there's no fishing rod in the case.

30
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,736
If I get home too early, my family would get suspicious,

31
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:37,536
so I decided to kill some time here.

32
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:43,436
Next, Mr. Kyota Honma who was using room number 2.

33
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:44,636
Yes.

34
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,236
"Kyoto Honma (32)" -I have a company karaoke contest

35
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,336
coming up soon, so I was practicing here.

36
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:52,536
Is your company near here?

37
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:53,636
No,

38
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:56,436
I'd be embarrassed if any of my colleagues found out.

39
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,436
So, I came all this way to a shop that's some distance away.

40
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,736
Do you buy cigarettes by the carton?

41
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:09,536
Yes, because I'm a heavy smoker.

42
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,636
Excuse me, I will need to check it.

43
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:21,336
Well, cigarettes cannot be used as a blunt weapon.

44
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:26,436
Oh, stopping by at a karaoke shop after school.

45
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,436
"Eisuke Hondo (17)" -Yes.

46
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,236
I tell you, young people nowadays.

47
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,636
Oh, a maracas!

48
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:41,536
I like this instrument!

49
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,136
The maracas can't be used either.

50
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:49,836
"Konji Arimoto (34)" -Next, Mr. Konji Arimoto of room 4.

51
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:53,536
I came here to sing karaoke with her after going to the gym.

52
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,336
No problem, is there?

53
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,636
Huh?

54
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,836
This is the new sparkling drink

55
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,736
that was introduced the other day, isn't it?

56
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:05,936
Yeah, I bought it because she wanted to try.

57
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:09,236
It was so junk that she only took a sip though.

58
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:14,336
A PET bottle can't kill either.

59
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:17,536
"Keep Out, Police Line"

60
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:21,836
We tried going around everyone's room

61
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,036
but there's no sign of the murder weapon.

62
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:28,036
True, I also checked the restrooms.

63
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,136
That's impossible.

64
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:33,836
I'm sure it's somewhere in this karaoke shop,

65
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,936
the blunt object that was used as the murder weapon.

66
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,036
Besides, I also want to confirm

67
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,736
if that man who was killed is a FBI agent.

68
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,336
The number you have called

69
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:47,036
cannot be reached because it is outside the service area

70
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,236
or switched off...

71
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:52,436
Why can't I get through to Ms. Jody?

72
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,936
Inspector!

73
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,336
The film that the victim had on him has been developed just now,

74
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,436
and we found out something unexpected.

75
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,436
Something unexpected?

76
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:05,836
Hey, what's this?

77
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:08,436
It's the picture of us! Gross.

78
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,236
Don't tell me he was a stalker?

79
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,836
I'm sure that's what he was. Yuck!

80
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:16,336
I guess this incident has nothing to do with us, then.

81
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:17,536
I guess not.

82
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:20,836
I've never seen the face of the victim either.

83
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:25,036
Are you saying that you all never even passed by him in the corridor?

84
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,536
No, we don't.

85
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,536
If we were to see the victim,

86
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,536
it would either be in the corridor or the men's room.

87
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,036
But I didn't see the face of anybody besides all those here.

88
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,336
As for me, I haven't seen any other customers

89
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:38,936
until this incident occurred.

90
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,636
Well, normal thinking would lead us to think

91
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:45,236
that the boy with the round glasses is the killer, no?

92
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,536
Right.

93
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:50,436
He probably killed the man because he was being stalked everywhere.

94
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,036
No.

95
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,836
Hey, take a good look.

96
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,736
I'm in the center of all of them.

97
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,336
I'm the one he was after.

98
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:07,236
It's not this glasses boy klutz he was after!

99
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,736
Oh, boy.

100
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:15,336
Officer, I think it's about time you let us go!

101
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,936
Right, officer!

102
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:21,936
It's true that Sonoko's in the middle of this picture too.

103
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:26,236
Then maybe the man who was killed wasn't a FBI agent, but...

104
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:28,136
Oh, wait a sec.

105
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,036
If I remember correctly...

106
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,736
It's already 7:30p.m.!

107
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:36,136
No, I can't let you go yet.

108
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:41,036
I don't mind staying here until all your doubts about me are cleared.

109
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,836
Please do so.

110
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,336
I just happen to have playing cards on me,

111
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:49,836
I'll be playing Poker or Black Jack with her and kill time.

112
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,036
Black Jack!

113
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,336
So, that trick could be used.

114
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,136
At any rate,

115
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:04,036
taking into consideration Mr. Moniwa's estimated time of death

116
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:08,036
who was killed in room number 5 of this karaoke shop,

117
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:12,436
the murder was committed between 18:00 to 18:20,

118
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:15,836
during a span of 30 minutes.

119
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,836
According to the surveillance camera,

120
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:22,636
the people who went in the direction of the victim's room are...

121
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:29,336
Mr. Kyota Honma, who left room number 2 at 17:50.

122
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:34,436
Mr. Eisuke Hondo, who left room number 3 at 18:03.

123
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:39,536
Mr. Konji Arimoto, who left room number 4 at 18:05.

124
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:44,836
And, Mr. Kunio Tamai, who left room number 1 at 18:07.

125
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:49,236
I'm certain that the killer is among you four.

126
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:51,736
I can't let you go yet.

127
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,536
But, the murder weapon is nowhere, right?

128
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:57,736
If I remember correctly, you mentioned it was some blunt object, right?

129
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:02,636
He did, I don't think he has the right to keep us here

130
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,636
because the murder weapon isn't found.

131
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:11,336
The murder weapon is here.

132
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:14,636
It's something that's unthinkable of being a murder weapon, though.

133
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,736
Sonoko! Your usual "thing" has come!

134
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:23,136
Oh, no. That wasn't me just now...

135
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:34,136
Just now?

136
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,636
Yes, I thought that

137
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:40,036
it doesn't have to be me to solve this simple case,

138
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,736
but I'll tell you why it's hard to find the murder weapon.

139
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:47,436
The trick involves the murder weapon changing shape

140
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:49,036
after the murder was committed

141
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,536
and disappearing, together with the killer who used it.

142
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:03,886
Yeah, if it's okay with you, please tell us how it was done, miss.

143
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,286
Hold it!

144
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,186
You're saying that it was a blunt object when the murder was committed,

145
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,686
but is gone now, right?

146
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:11,786
Yes.

147
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:14,286
I got it, then.

148
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:18,286
The murder weapon was probably a huge clump of ice!

149
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,386
And the murder had a cooler box

150
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,986
that he could keep the ice in for a long period of time.

151
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:26,286
Mr. Kunio Tamai. It's you!

152
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,886
What?

153
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,986
Too bad. Wrong.

154
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:32,986
It's true that if ice were used to strike the victim's head,

155
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:35,686
after the murder is committed, it would melt and disappear.

156
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,286
But if it were used,

157
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:40,786
shattered pieces of ice and drops of water would splatter,

158
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:43,286
and smears made by water should've been found.

159
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:46,186
No such smears were found anywhere.

160
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,286
And, judging from the splattered blood of the victim,

161
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,386
left as is, there is no trace of the killer having wiped the floor

162
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,286
after committing the murder.

163
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,686
The murderer put that hard something inside something and struck the victim,

164
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,686
after making sure that it wouldn't scatter.

165
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,886
I see, a PET bottle!

166
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:05,686
If the content is frozen stiff,

167
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:07,686
water wouldn't splatter as much!

168
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:08,786
In other words,

169
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,286
the culprit would be the one who had the PET bottle

170
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:13,086
with a sparkling drink in it,

171
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,186
in other words, you, Mr. Arimoto,

172
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,786
No, wrong!

173
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:21,186
Mr. Akimoto left the room at a little after 18:00.

174
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:25,486
Inspector, you checked the PET bottle at 19:30.

175
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,186
In an air conditioned room like this,

176
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,086
ice inside a 500 ml bottle

177
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:33,286
will not melt completely in an hour and a half.

178
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:38,086
Then, what is the hard thing that you're talking about?

179
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,786
Oh, I think you have some too, Inspector.

180
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,986
What?

181
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:47,586
Yes, it's an essential item that everyone has.

182
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,386
Coins, loose change!

183
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:52,686
And most probably ten yen coins!

184
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,886
-Ten... -Ten yen coin?

185
00:11:55,886 --> 00:12:00,286
Miss, just how can somebody strike a person with a ten yen coin?

186
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,686
You are right, with just one ten yen coin,

187
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,386
the most a person can do is wound someone.

188
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:08,286
But with 300 coins,

189
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:12,086
it'll turn into a blunt object weighing 1.5 kilograms.

190
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,986
Although that's true, but...

191
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:17,386
Nobody had that many coins on them.

192
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,186
The person got rid of it after committing the murder.

193
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,986
Got rid of it?

194
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:25,286
By putting it into the machine behind you, Inspector.

195
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:30,986
-I see! -The cigarette vending machine!

196
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:34,186
In other words, 300 ten yen coins were put inside the PET bottle

197
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,186
and used as a murder weapon to beat the victim to death!

198
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:40,986
Then, later the coins were inserted into the vending machine and used.

199
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,686
No, no, no!

200
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,186
The mouth of the bottle of the sparkling drink is too small

201
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,486
to insert a ten yen coin.

202
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,586
Besides, if something like that were put inside the PET bottle,

203
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,686
it would be damaged from the inside and outside.

204
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,486
One look and it would be obvious.

205
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,286
But, what on earth were the coins put inside then?

206
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:00,186
Yes, just like the ten yen coin,

207
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,186
it's an essential item that everyone uses,

208
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:05,786
Moreover, if a lot of ten yen coins are stuffed inside it,

209
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,286
it turns into a weapon commonly called Black Jack.

210
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,786
A sock!

211
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:11,986
A sock?

212
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,086
Isn't that right,

213
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,886
Mr. Kyota Honma?

214
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,186
Why is it him?

215
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,786
Both Mr. Tamai and Eisuke are wearing socks, too.

216
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:28,586
Mr. Honma's shoes are tightly fitted, see?

217
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,486
Excuse me.

218
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:38,586
True.

219
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:42,886
When he came into our room once by mistake,

220
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,286
he bumped into Mr. Arimoto and fell,

221
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:49,186
but back then his shoe was not tight, so it came off.

222
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:51,286
Now, he's wearing the sock that he used

223
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,586
for the murder weapon over another sock.

224
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:56,786
He probably wanted to hide the victim's blood

225
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:00,186
that splattered on his sock when committing the murder.

226
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:04,186
Come to think of it, Mr. Honma had a carton of cigarettes.

227
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:06,886
If he has the wrapping paper of the carton beforehand,

228
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,486
after getting rid of the ten yen coins

229
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:11,786
that were used to commit the murder with the vending machine,

230
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,186
even if a lot of cigarettes come out,

231
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,386
he could put in the wrapping paper and get away with it.

232
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:19,186
If you check the vending machine for a large amount of ten yen coins,

233
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,086
that's conclusive evidence.

234
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,086
If blood is on his sock,

235
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,586
blood should also be found on the 10 yen coins inside.

236
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:29,986
I'm sure his fingerprints are on them, too.

237
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,886
I don't think the culprit who wanted to use up

238
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:34,086
all the ten yen coins as soon as possible and leave the scene,

239
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,686
would bother to use gloves.

240
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:41,486
Then, you lied when you said that you've never seen the victim?

241
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,386
Never seen him, my foot.

242
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:45,686
I'll bet you know him very well, isn't it?

243
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:46,786
What?

244
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,086
The victim's name is Tatsumi.

245
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,586
Just by the sound of the name

246
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,686
it's hard to tell whether the victim is a he or a she.

247
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:55,086
However, Mr. Honma mentioned that

248
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,686
if he were to see the victim,

249
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,186
it would be in the corridor or the men's room.

250
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:03,886
Didn't he say this because he knew the man already?

251
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,186
He would never run into a woman in the restroom

252
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:09,586
because the men's room and the ladies' room are separated.

253
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,786
Yeah, I knew him.

254
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,386
I'd never forget

255
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:24,786
that man's face!

256
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:27,486
I'll never forget that kidnapper's face!

257
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:30,086
Kidnapper?

258
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,386
Yeah.

259
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:35,186
That guy kidnapped my son,

260
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:39,286
and after learning that I reported it to the police...

261
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:47,086
he killed my son, who was only 4 years old,

262
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,086
just to get back at me.

263
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,286
Daddy!

264
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,986
Oh, no...

265
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,586
Officer,

266
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,186
do you remember the kidnapping case

267
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:02,586
that occurred in Okubocho, a year ago?

268
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,486
Yeah, I heard that the suspect was caught

269
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:09,286
but that he was acquitted due to insufficient evidence.

270
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,986
Right, the murder weapon wasn't found.

271
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:17,486
It seems that guy used the same trick I used too, though.

272
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:19,586
That's why you've been following him waiting for a chance

273
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,186
to find a place that would meet the condition for carrying out the trick.

274
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:26,786
In other words, you decided to carry out your revenge at this karaoke shop

275
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,886
that has individual rooms and a cigarette vending machine.

276
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:31,286
Yeah.

277
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,886
Well, I hope you're grateful.

278
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,486
Judging from the picture he had on him,

279
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:42,686
the next targets might've been you people.

280
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,586
Well, if my son were as cautious as you,

281
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,786
he wouldn't have been kidnapped in the first place.

282
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,186
By the same token, a parent who would do something so stupid like this

283
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,786
may not have existed either.

284
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,186
Some welcome back celebration it turned out to be.

285
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:06,386
But, I was really overwhelmed with emotion.

286
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:09,086
Your deduction show, Sonoko.

287
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:11,386
You were just like the Sleeping Kogoro!

288
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,386
Yeah...

289
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,986
Your deduction was just as good as if not better than Shinichi's.

290
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,086
Really?

291
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,586
I don't remember a thing.

292
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:23,286
Shinichi? You mean that high school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:26,586
Right. He also Ran's "working away from home" husband.

294
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,186
Sonoko!

295
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:30,286
You're high school students and married?

296
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:31,886
Of course we're not married.

297
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,086
Why would I marry a guy like that?

298
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,786
He says he's busy with a case

299
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,686
and is out on a long business trip, you see!

300
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:40,486
They're like a long separated couple.

301
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,986
No. In fact, I'm living with her.

302
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:45,786
Oh, I've got some other books I want to buy,

303
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:49,086
-so you can go ahead home. -What? Now?

304
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,286
Don't worry, I'll stay with him

305
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,986
and make sure to bring him back to the detective agency.

306
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,686
Okay.

307
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,786
So? What is it?

308
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,086
You went out of your way to stay with me.

309
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,786
So, you must want to talk to me, right?

310
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,586
Yeah, I was thinking about it,

311
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:15,786
but I've decided to go to the States.

312
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:18,886
Did you decide to accept the witness protection program?

313
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:21,786
No, I refused.

314
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,986
Like I told you before, I don't like being tied down.

315
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:27,586
I seem to be lucky so far that the guys of the bad organization

316
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:31,186
haven't found me yet, either.

317
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,186
Then, why are you leaving for the States?

318
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,486
In order to join the CIA like my father and older sister did!

319
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:40,386
I'm going to reveal their evil doings from corner to corner

320
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,286
and eventually bust the entire Organization together with big sis.

321
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,386
First, you've got to do something about your clumsiness,

322
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:52,386
or you're not going to make it as a CIA agent.

323
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,986
Yeah.

324
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,886
Besides, the CIA is an organization

325
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,786
that works for the national benefit of the US.

326
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,986
I wonder if he knows that?

327
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,886
But, if you decided on leaving,

328
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:07,086
why did you come back to school?

329
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,686
Although it was just for a short while,

330
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:12,086
I wanted to meet the friends I made here once more before going.

331
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,086
I wanted to confess to Ran that.

332
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,886
I fell in love at first sight with her.

333
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:25,686
I've never seen anyone so pretty and kind like her, you see.

334
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:29,186
But, she seems to like Shinichi,

335
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,286
although I don't know how he feels about her.

336
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:37,386
Oh, right. Do you know how to get in touch with Shinichi?

337
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,686
Yeah.

338
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,886
Then, will you ask him for me

339
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:44,686
whether it's okay to tell Ran how I feel about her?

340
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,786
I won't be like Shinichi

341
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:52,386
and leave Ran to fend for herself.

342
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,386
And also that I'm planning to take her to the States with me in the future

343
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,986
and live happily ever after.

344
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,086
You can't.

345
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:05,286
No, I'm not asking for your opinion, ask Shinichi for me.

346
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,786
That's why I'm telling you it won't work!

347
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:19,186
Then... Then, don't tell me that you're...

348
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,586
Yeah, I'm exactly who you think I am.

349
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:36,486
So, the mystery's been solved!

350
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,786
I went to the Mouri Detective Agency to begin with

351
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,186
because I heard that he had seen Rena Mizunashi

352
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:43,986
just before she disappeared.

353
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:46,186
Back then, I didn't know that she was my older sister

354
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:48,886
as well as a member of the CIA.

355
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:52,086
Therefore, I thought that Detective Mouri conspired with bad people

356
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,286
sheltering her somewhere.

357
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:59,986
That's why I was checking up on Detective Mouri on my own.

358
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:02,286
Then, I found something out.

359
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:05,886
Detective Mouri's deduction before he becomes the Sleeping Kogoro

360
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:09,286
and after he becomes it, is totally different.

361
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:13,586
Moreover, you're always somewhere near the Sleeping Kogoro.

362
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:16,886
I tried not to think of why you've shrunk,

363
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:20,386
but just as I thought you're Shinichi Kudo, aren't you?

364
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:21,986
What do you mean "just as I thought"?

365
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:24,086
You sound like you already know about everything.

366
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,486
Yes, I assumed things to be this way.

367
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,586
From the time the Sleeping Kogoro appeared,

368
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,486
you were absent from school.

369
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,686
And, there was just one time that I fell deliberately

370
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:35,986
and not because I was a klutz.

371
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:39,786
Do you remember what I said when I saw you for the first time?

372
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:43,186
Nice to meet you, Detective Mouri.

373
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:45,086
I'm honoured to see you.

374
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,886
Then, you did all this just so that you could get the truth out of me?

375
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:53,186
Oh, but it's true that I fell in love at first sight with Ran.

376
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,586
Make sure you make her happy.

377
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,386
Oh, right. Do you know?

378
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:29,686
Something seems to have happened at the FBI.

379
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:32,886
What do you mean?

380
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:36,686
It looked like someone passed away.

381
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:41,086
But, if you haven't heard anything,

382
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,586
I guess everything's okay.

383
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:54,686
Yeah, everything's okay.

384
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:01,486
"Next Episode"

385
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:04,686
We have no clients today either?

386
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:06,986
Who could be calling at this time of night?

387
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,986
Code name.

388
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:10,486
Bourbon.

389
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:16,086
Maybe one of the three set fire to the building.

390
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,486
Those guys...

391
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:21,486
must be around here.

392
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,486
The members from that organization.

393
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:25,186
Next Conan,

394
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,986
"The Youth Detective Squad And Red, White, Yellow"

395
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:47,186
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,086
"Diary"

397
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,486
Next expisode is red, white and yellow.

398
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:51,786
You mean tulips?

399
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,563
-The sports festival! -A bean-paste bun?
