1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:03,373
Mr. Mouri, it was raining really bad this morning,

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:04,673
but didn't you get wet?

3
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:06,373
No.

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,573
I see.

5
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:10,873
But what a large vineyard you have.

6
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:14,473
Is this vineyard all for your winery, Yurika?

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,773
Yes, I inherited it from my late father.

8
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:23,973
And I am now co-managing the Suwayama Winery

9
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:27,473
together with my husband who was studying agriculture

10
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:30,173
and friend, Mr. Mizumachi.

11
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,373
I see.

12
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:34,873
"Yurika Suwayama (28)" -I'm not too good about vineyards and all,

13
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:37,373
"Joint manager of a winery" -so I depend on the two, you see.

14
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:41,273
I'm looking forward to seeing the wine!

15
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:43,973
Don't over drink, Pops.

16
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,873
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

17
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:48,773
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

18
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:50,473
An incident occurs at the winery.

19
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:52,373
An alibi trick at the vineyard.

20
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:53,973
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:55,973
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,573
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:43,098
"A Rose in a Vineyard".

24
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:59,898
This is very elegant tasting wine!

25
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,998
To comment that this wine is elegant...

26
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:05,398
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

27
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:07,498
Well, I guess so

28
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:11,098
because I'm quite picky when it comes to wine.

29
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,998
You just said what came to mind at random, right?

30
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:17,598
"Akihiro Yamaguchi (41)" -I run several restaurants in Tokyo.

31
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,198
"Restaurant manager" -My name is Akihiro Yamaguchi.

32
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,798
I am in love with Suwayama wine.

33
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:25,798
So, I'm scheduled to sign a contract with them today.

34
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,098
I see!

35
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,098
It's true that this wine is different from other wines.

36
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:36,698
On top of that, the owner, Yurika, also a very beautiful lady.

37
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:38,898
I'm sorry, Mr. Yamaguchi.

38
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,198
What seems to be the matter?

39
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:45,098
I can't seem to find Kengo who has the contract.

40
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,498
I think we'll find it right away though.

41
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,998
Again?

42
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,898
Yes. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,798
Her husband, Kengo,

44
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,298
is a professor type and not easy to get along with,

45
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:01,298
and is also too absorbed in making wine.

46
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,198
When I saw him previously...

47
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,498
"Kengo Suwayama (33), Yurika's husband" -I'm not going to sign a contract

48
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,898
"An agriculturist" -that's bound to lower the taste of Suwayama wine!

49
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,498
Well, I guess it's his adherence to his ways that makes this Suwayama wine.

50
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:18,598
But, the contract this time is not a bad one.

51
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,798
I feel sorry for Yurika.

52
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,198
Mr. Mizumachi.

53
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,198
"Tomoaki Mizumachi (34), Joint owner of the winery" -Did you see Kengo?

54
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,398
No. I haven't seen him since I saw him this morning.

55
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:31,698
"Shuji Takashina (28), Employee at the winery" -Maybe he's hiding

56
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,898
because he doesn't want to see Mr. Yamaguchi?

57
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,898
Maybe he's not convinced after all.

58
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,698
Don't worry, Yurika.

59
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,398
Although he hasn't shown up,

60
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:42,798
it seems Kengo has come to agree with the contract.

61
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:43,798
Huh?

62
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:45,898
See, take a look at this.

63
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:47,998
I found it on the desk of the barn.

64
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:51,398
So Kengo signed the contract already!

65
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,198
I'm happy for you.

66
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:56,298
Mr. Yamaguchi, the contract's been found.

67
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,098
This completes the contract!

68
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,798
I'm counting on you, Mr. Yamaguchi.

69
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,898
Yurika, Mr. Mizumachi,

70
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,498
we're going to be partners from now on,

71
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:09,498
so please discuss what you have to anytime with me.

72
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:10,898
We will.

73
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:14,398
I wonder where Kengo disappeared to though.

74
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:19,598
I will go look for Kengo at the barn on the south vineyard.

75
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,498
Mr. Mizumachi,

76
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,798
could you take Mr. Mouri and his party

77
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,798
on a tour of our vineyard for me in the meantime?

78
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:30,898
In the vineyard to the south over there is the Cabernet Sauvignon

79
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:34,698
and in the vineyard to the north, are the Pinot Noir grapes.

80
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,098
The south is of red clay soil,

81
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:38,698
whereas the north is of sand and gravel soil.

82
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:41,998
Although in the same vineyard, the type of soil is different.

83
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:45,998
So, we are growing different types of grapes that match the soil.

84
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,698
Is that how it works?

85
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:51,098
There's a fog over the vineyard and it looks beautiful.

86
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:54,398
That's not fog, but natural insecticide.

87
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:58,098
It is sprayed every day between the hours of 13:00 to 16:00.

88
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:00,098
It's about ending time now.

89
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,198
You're also growing roses?

90
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,198
No, these roses aren't for viewing

91
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,298
but rather to keep pests away.

92
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:12,298
Of course, it's not that the roses keep the pests away, though.

93
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:15,998
The roses are weaker than the grapes when it comes to pests and illnesses.

94
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,498
So, they wither before the grapes.

95
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,398
When the roses wither,

96
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:23,498
it means that danger is closing in on the vineyards, then.

97
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:28,498
Hey, do you grow different types of roses, depending on the vineyard?

98
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,698
No, they're the same type.

99
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,598
But, the colors of the roses are different.

100
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,298
That's not because the type of roses is different.

101
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,398
Hey, Yurika!

102
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,498
Did you find your husband?

103
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,198
No.

104
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:46,698
Since he's nowhere in sight,

105
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,998
I was thinking of going to look for him

106
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,698
in the barrel cellar that's in the north vineyard from now.

107
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:51,898
Barrel cellar?

108
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:57,298
Yes, wine that is ageing before bottling is there.

109
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,698
When you say ageing, does that mean

110
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:02,898
that you get to drink wine that is not aged?

111
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,998
I would really like to go there with you!

112
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,198
At all costs, Yurika!

113
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,098
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,298
Okay, shall we all go then?

115
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,698
Thank you!

116
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,898
This is...

117
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,698
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:51,398
This is homicide.

119
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:52,998
After tying his arms and legs,

120
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,998
his neck was hung using this stake.

121
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:58,198
Ridiculous! It can't be.

122
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,998
He couldn't be dead.

123
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:03,498
Hey! What do you mean by he couldn't be dead?

124
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,098
Detective Momoi!

125
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,898
The estimated time of death of the victim has been determined.

126
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,698
"Detective Momoi (32)" -It was around 13:30 to 14:30 today.

127
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,098
"of Yamanashi Prefectural Police Department" -I see.

128
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:24,698
What were you doing at that time?

129
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:27,698
I was working alone at the barn in the south vineyard

130
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:30,698
under order of Yurika.

131
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,098
Which means that

132
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:36,198
there is no one who can verify your alibi for you?

133
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:37,898
Hey, please wait!

134
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:41,698
I was asked by Yurika to confine Kengo in here and that's all I did!

135
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,398
I did tie him, but I didn't kill him!

136
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,598
Please believe me!

137
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,898
I didn't ask him to do such a thing!

138
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,898
Why you... Yurika...

139
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:50,898
Yurika.

140
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,098
Will you please give me your alibi during that time while we're at it?

141
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:58,598
I, Kogoro Mouri will guarantee Yurika's alibi!

142
00:08:58,598 --> 00:08:59,998
Today at 13:30,

143
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,898
she came to pick us up at the station.

144
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,398
And we arrived at the winery about 14:30.

145
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,498
After that, Yurika was with us right through.

146
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,298
I see.

147
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:16,698
Come to think of it, at about 15:30,

148
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:20,698
I headed for the barn in the south vineyard to search for Kengo.

149
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,998
Well, that has nothing to do with the time of death,

150
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,598
so that's no problem.

151
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,598
And we met Yurika again

152
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:31,398
at around a bit pass 16:00.

153
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,498
At this barrel cellar in the north vineyard,

154
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:37,498
we found the corpse at 16:30.

155
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:38,998
I see.

156
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,398
And, you two from around 13:00 till now

157
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:45,598
were in the winery facility? Is that correct?

158
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,198
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,198
I...

160
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:51,398
Early this morning, in the rain,

161
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:55,798
I saw Kengo and Mr. Mizumachi walking towards the barrel cellar.

162
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:58,998
By the way,

163
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,898
how many of you have the key to the barrel cellar?

164
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:04,798
Me, Mr. Mizumachi and Kengo.

165
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,298
And, Yurika also has one.

166
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:11,098
The victim's key was in his pocket.

167
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,298
And,

168
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:14,698
the lock of the barrel cellar was locked.

169
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,998
In other words, the culprit is someone who has the key

170
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:23,398
and moreover, has no alibi during the time of the death of the victim.

171
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,298
Officer,

172
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,598
I really can't understand.

173
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:28,798
Hey, you!

174
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:31,298
Why did the culprit go out of the way

175
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,898
to take Kengo's body over to the wall?

176
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,498
Huh, take the corpse over?

177
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,798
Yep. Because take a look at that.

178
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,698
The two black lines

179
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,498
are traces of shoe marks scraping along the floor, right?

180
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,798
It's true that it matches the toes of the victim.

181
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,998
If the tip of his shoes were scraped,

182
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,998
that means that Kengo was lying face down.

183
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:57,298
Besides, those lines are almost in one straight line, aren't they?

184
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,798
Which means that he didn't put up a fight.

185
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:03,698
In other words, it means that he was already dead by then.

186
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:05,198
I see.

187
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,898
That's why such strange marks are left on his neck.

188
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,698
The traces of the strangulation mark

189
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:15,098
lead from the bottom of his throat to the base of his neck.

190
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,698
Means that the corpse was lying on his stomach

191
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:21,298
and the culprit strangled the victim from behind.

192
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,598
I see.

193
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,298
But why did the culprit after killing the victim,

194
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,498
hang him from the wall?

195
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:32,298
Huh? Why is the way the rope is tied different?

196
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:37,398
This knot is just a plain square knot,

197
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,598
but the rope that tied Kengo's arm and legs

198
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,398
are two half hitched.

199
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:42,998
Two half hitches?

200
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:47,898
I saw Mr. Mizumachi tying a string in the vineyard a while ago.

201
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:51,198
Two half hitch tying is difficult to loosen,

202
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:52,698
so it is used in agriculture

203
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:55,298
and is a special way of making a knot.

204
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,998
True! The knots are different.

205
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,298
It's strange.

206
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:03,498
Why did the culprit tie a square knot

207
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:06,698
that may loosen up only on this side?

208
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,598
If Mr. Mizumachi were the culprit,

209
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:11,498
he would probably tie it so that the rope used as the murder weapon

210
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,898
would not loosen up.

211
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:16,798
Maybe the person who tied his arms and legs

212
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,098
and the person who tied the rope around his neck

213
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,698
are different people?

214
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,698
But, the only person here that doesn't have an alibi

215
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,798
is Mr. Mizumachi alone.

216
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,098
Exactly.

217
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:28,698
Everyone except Mr. Mizumachi has an alibi.

218
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,998
Oh no, there's mud on!

219
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,298
I love these shoes and yet...

220
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:36,798
I see.

221
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,898
Mud!

222
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,098
I see.

223
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:52,598
That person created an alibi with this!

224
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:59,765
Are you all right, Yurika?

225
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:01,865
I'm sure that Mr. Mizumachi did what he did

226
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,465
through his consideration for me.

227
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,865
Shipping out 800 bottles a year,

228
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,265
you must be kidding!

229
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:13,865
We could never make that amount with our vineyard alone!

230
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,665
If we stop organic farming,

231
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:18,065
we could yield more grapes.

232
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,465
And if that's not enough,

233
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,365
we can buy grapes from other vineyards.

234
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,165
If we stop organic farming

235
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,765
or mix different grapes with ours,

236
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,665
the quality of Suwayama wine will deteriorate!

237
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,165
Management is tough,

238
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,565
so we've got no choice.

239
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,865
We're getting nowhere!

240
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:41,465
I'm sure that in order to settle the contract today, he...

241
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:44,165
So, the motive's been determined.

242
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,565
He has no alibi when the crime was committed,

243
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:50,065
so I guess there's no doubt that Mizumachi is the culprit.

244
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,165
Excuse me...

245
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,665
Detective Momoi.

246
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,965
Please don't arrest Mr. Mizumachi just yet.

247
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:09,965
Huh?

248
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,565
Why?

249
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,765
I've figured out everything just now.

250
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:17,365
I've been mistaken.

251
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,265
The culprit is not Mr. Mizumachi,

252
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,165
but another person.

253
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,565
Don't tell me that this is the famous...

254
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,765
The one who almost 100% solves all cases,

255
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,665
the Sleeping Kogoro?

256
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,665
Mr. Mouri, who on earth is the culprit?

257
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:34,465
There was a pitfall to this case.

258
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,265
A pitfall?

259
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:41,565
The victim was killed between 13:30 and 14:30.

260
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:43,965
The people with alibis during this time

261
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:47,165
are inevitably knocked off the list of suspects.

262
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:50,065
Yes, that's the procedure of investigation.

263
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,965
But, even if the culprit is not there,

264
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:57,765
if it were possible to kill the victim at a convenient time, what then?

265
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:01,265
After Mr. Mizumachi tied the victim up

266
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:04,265
and confined him in the barrel cellar,

267
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,865
the culprit went there in turn

268
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,365
and rigged a certain trick on the victim

269
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,465
and killed him.

270
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:14,565
Detective Momoi.

271
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:19,265
I would like you to help me to make explaining this easier.

272
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,565
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,765
I would like to replay

274
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:24,565
the circumstances that the victim was under before he died.

275
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:27,465
First, please lay on your stomach on the floor.

276
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,765
Like this?

277
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:32,465
Please imagine that your arms and legs are tied,

278
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,465
and lurch your back far behind.

279
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:39,965
This position is tough!

280
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,565
The greatest mystery

281
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,465
were the number of strangulation marks that were found on the victim.

282
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,565
The reason for that is this.

283
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:53,765
The culprit lurched the body of the victim backwards,

284
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:57,665
and tied his neck and ankles with one rope.

285
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,665
Huh?

286
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:03,065
Then the victim in order not to choke his own neck,

287
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,465
has to keep on lurching his body backwards.

288
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,065
As a result,

289
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,765
a lot of strangulation marks were left on his neck.

290
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,265
Oh, no!

291
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:14,365
The knot of the rope that was hooked onto the stake on the wall,

292
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:17,765
and the knot of the rope that was tied to his arms and legs

293
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,765
were different because of this.

294
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,265
I see!

295
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,365
The bruise of him being choked from behind was left

296
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,665
because the rope that was tied to the victim's legs

297
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,165
was pulling his neck.

298
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,365
But, why did the culprit carry out such a trick?

299
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:35,665
As I have mentioned earlier,

300
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,865
it was to establish an alibi.

301
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,365
Doing it this way,

302
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,965
the culprit could buy time until the victim gets exhausted and dies.

303
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:47,065
What a ruthless thing to do just to establish an alibi.

304
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:50,565
After establishing an alibi during the time of the death of the victim,

305
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:54,065
the culprit returns to the barrel cellar again

306
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:57,265
and unties the rope that was tied around the neck and the ankles

307
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,765
in order to hide evidence of the trick.

308
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:04,165
Finally, the corpse was hung by the wall.

309
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:07,865
The only person who could've done this is...

310
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,065
Yurika,

311
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:12,665
you're the one who killed Kengo!

312
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,565
Don't be ridiculous!

313
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,465
You left the winery at around 15:30

314
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:23,665
saying that you were going to look for the victim, didn't you?

315
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:27,265
Back then, I went to the barn in the south vineyard.

316
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,465
I didn't come to this barrel cellar.

317
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,065
No, that's a lie.

318
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:35,965
Today you didn't go to the south vineyard, not even once.

319
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:36,965
Huh?

320
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,665
Cabernet Sauvignon grapes that favor red clay soil

321
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:44,265
is grown in the south vineyard.

322
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:46,065
The soil of the south vineyard

323
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,865
was muddy rain in the morning.

324
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,765
Damp red clay soil sticks easily,

325
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,365
so on Mr. Mizumachi's shoes

326
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,065
who was working in the barn of the south vineyard,

327
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:00,565
red clay soil unique to the south vineyard was found.

328
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:06,065
On the other hand, no red soil was found on your shoes or hem.

329
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,365
That's...

330
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,765
That's not proof of anything!

331
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,265
Mizumachi's the one who killed my husband!

332
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,365
No, it's not.

333
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,165
It's true that Mr. Mizumachi confined Kengo here.

334
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,565
But, he didn't kill him.

335
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,265
How can you be so sure?

336
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,065
I sure can!

337
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:29,865
Because Mr. Mizumachi never came back to this barrel cellar.

338
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:32,265
How do you know?

339
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:37,365
The victim died between 13:30 and 14:30.

340
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:42,465
Mr. Mizumachi from 15:30 was walking through the vineyard with us.

341
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:47,065
So, the only time he could've rigged something up

342
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:50,765
would've been limited to between 13:30 to 15:30!

343
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,265
But just at that time...

344
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,565
Yes, between 13:00 to 16:00,

345
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,765
in the north vineyard where the barrel cellar is,

346
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,165
a natural pesticide, wood vinegar was bring sprayed.

347
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,465
Conan!

348
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:04,565
Yes.

349
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,465
Wood vinegar is an acid liquid that is made from

350
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:09,265
the ashes of wood that is burned.

351
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,665
This is blue on the litmus paper.

352
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,865
If the color turns to pink, it is acidy.

353
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,065
There's no change!

354
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:20,765
There isn't any acidy wood vinegar on Mr. Mizumachi's clothes.

355
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,465
True! Which means that...

356
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,665
That's right,

357
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:29,565
it means that he didn't go to the north vineyard at that time.

358
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,365
But, Yurika,

359
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:34,465
you have wood vinegar on your body.

360
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,565
Where do you have such proof?

361
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:39,265
Your rose hair clip.

362
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,665
Hair clip?

363
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:44,065
It was a pretty silver color in the day time,

364
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:46,365
but now it's oxidized and blackened.

365
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:52,965
Silver craft turns black when sprinkled with acid liquid!

366
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,965
This is blackened

367
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,065
because when I went to look for Kengo in the barn,

368
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,065
I was sprayed with wood vinegar at the south vineyard!

369
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,565
That's not possible.

370
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,765
Look at the roses outside.

371
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:08,165
The same type of roses are grown

372
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,765
and yet, the roses that are planted in the south vineyard...

373
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,465
are yellow.

374
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,565
The colors of the roses are different

375
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:18,865
because what was sprinkled on the vineyards was different.

376
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:22,765
"Wood vinegar" -In the north vineyard, acid wood vinegar was sprayed.

377
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,465
"Alkaline Bourdeaux" -While in the south vineyard,

378
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,865
alkaline Bourdeaux mixture was sprayed.

379
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,965
Like the litmus paper,

380
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,965
yellow roses turn up with a reddish tint

381
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,365
when constantly in contact with acid liquid.

382
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:42,065
If you were really walking through the south vineyard,

383
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:45,465
your silver hair clip wouldn't be discolored.

384
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:50,165
What's this?

385
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,765
To think that something like this would serve as proof...

386
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:58,065
Yes, that's right. I killed Kengo.

387
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,165
Yurika...

388
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:03,265
Yurika, you did something like this to sign a contract with the restaurant?

389
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:05,465
I didn't do it just for the money.

390
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,265
Kengo's to blame!

391
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,865
I understand, Yurika.

392
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,665
Let's get a divorce.

393
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:21,965
If the quality of Suwayama wine is going to deteriorate,

394
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:23,965
I'm leaving.

395
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,365
Why?

396
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,665
You don't have any understanding whatsoever about wine.

397
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,665
It was my mistake for marrying a woman like you.

398
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,165
I couldn't forgive him

399
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,065
after he despised me

400
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:44,465
and the nerve of him to choose wine instead of me.

401
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:47,265
Who cares what kind of grapes are used!

402
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,565
Who cares about wine!

403
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:17,065
"Mouri Detective Agency"

404
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,965
You already drank all the wine

405
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,665
they gave you as a token of their thanks, Dad?

406
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:27,165
That's the vintage wine that Mr. Yamaguchi was complimenting, right?

407
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,065
Then, if we let it age for several years...

408
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,165
It would've gotten more delicious.

409
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:35,065
No more wine for me.

410
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:40,365
No matter how long Pops ages,

411
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:42,565
he'll never mature.

412
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:44,965
"Next Episode" -Oh, you're all here?

413
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:48,965
Who's that beauty?

414
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:51,465
If so, the one who vandalized the garden is...

415
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:52,465
Do you have any idea of someone

416
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,365
who would want to harass this district center?

417
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,665
One person, I guess.

418
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,065
What's wrong?

419
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,465
It looks like that petal is not from the flowers of this garden.

420
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,965
Maybe...

421
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,465
Next Conan,

422
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,765
"Flower Garden Vandalism Conspiracy".

423
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,465
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:32,565
"Brick".

425
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:34,565
Dad, don't get drunk and go inside the flower garden!

426
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:36,065
Huh? I'm the star in the next episode?

427
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,765
Just what're you talking about?
