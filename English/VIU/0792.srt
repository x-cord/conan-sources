1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,922
And?

2
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:05,722
Why did you confirm time and again

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:08,322
whether people were tailing us and called us here?

4
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:09,822
I don't think you wanted to show us

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,422
how good you've become in disguising yourself, did you?

6
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:14,622
No.

7
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,322
This morning, Kir...

8
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:19,122
I got mail from Reina Mizunashi.

9
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:20,922
-What? -Then,

10
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:23,222
it seems that those guys still don't know

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,922
that you're alive, Mr. Akai?

12
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:28,022
No, probably not. I received text mail

13
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:30,422
but it consisted only of three letters of the alphabet.

14
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,222
Three letters of the alphabet?

15
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,322
An abbreviation of something?

16
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:38,822
No. It's the name of a liquor that both of you know very well of.

17
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,822
R-U-M. RUM.

18
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,223
Their code name.

19
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,422
RUM?

20
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,922
When I was at the Organization,

21
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,722
I heard that name two or three times.

22
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:53,622
It seems to be the name of a close aide to the boss.

23
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,122
Aide?

24
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,922
But I got no such info.

25
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:00,722
Judging from the looks of it, because only the letters were sent over,

26
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:04,322
circumstances may have been so urgent

27
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:07,622
that she had no time to text you anything.

28
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:10,322
Just go and tell James that the big shot's

29
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:13,122
going to start making a move, will you?

30
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,723
Somebody greater than Gin.

31
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,322
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

32
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:22,422
Love and cases come from the same origin.

33
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:24,322
A child watches three adults.

34
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:26,522
The testimony of a witness leads to a crime.

35
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:27,922
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,822
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,423
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:17,720
"The Three First Discoverers (Part 1)"

39
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:20,408
By the way, did you see it?

40
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,508
The Tokyo Derby yesterday?

41
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,108
The match between the Spirits and Noir, right?

42
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,308
I did, I saw it! Hide did a hat-trick, right?

43
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,308
It's no wonder he's their star player!

44
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,309
-"Lum"? -Yeah.

45
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,309
You mean the one that says, "Daccha?"

46
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,008
Oh, I don't mean the anime character,

47
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,508
but it's the name of liquor.

48
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,808
The kind that pirates often drink.

49
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,908
No. I'm not familiar.

50
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,608
I told you before, I don't know much about liquor.

51
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,809
Right.

52
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,808
In order to get information on "Rum" the close advisor of the boss

53
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,608
of the Black Organization,

54
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,308
we'd have to wait for Ms. Rena Mizunashi

55
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,508
who has snuck into the Organization, to contact us.

56
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,708
Or, to make Mr. Amuro, of the security police

57
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,709
who has also infiltrated the Organization tell us.

58
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,409
But...

59
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,408
I do know that

60
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:24,009
the code name of number two of the Organization is Rum.

61
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,808
Number two?

62
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:30,808
At least when I was there, that's what I heard.

63
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,508
We've never met, though.

64
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,308
What kind of person? A man, a woman?

65
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,308
I just told you, we've never met, didn't I?

66
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:44,608
When I was at the Organization, I've heard rumors of all descriptions.

67
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,708
A large brawny man.

68
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,008
An effeminate man.

69
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,908
An aged man.

70
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:55,308
Some claimed that they were all his doubles.

71
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:59,408
A large brawny man, an effeminate man, and an aged man.

72
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,608
Hey! I hope this Rum person

73
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:04,408
hasn't started some kind of search for me?

74
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:05,708
No.

75
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,808
The code names of the ones in the Organization are all liquor, right?

76
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,308
So, I was just wondering if there was

77
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,608
a person named Rum among them too.

78
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,108
What's Run?

79
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:17,108
You were talking about it just now!

80
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,208
Rum's searching, or something like that.

81
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,708
Tell us. I want to know!

82
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:25,308
Oh. Rum...

83
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,608
Rumune.

84
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:27,908
Rumune?

85
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:32,208
Well, after playing soccer in the park, you get thirsty, right?

86
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:35,108
That's why I was looking for it

87
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,708
wondering if they sell it at the candy store

88
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,108
on the other side of the street!

89
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,508
Oh. You mean the rumune drink?

90
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,708
Why not ordinary juice?

91
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,508
I... I guess so.

92
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,708
That boy's still there.

93
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,908
That boy?

94
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:53,008
See. That boy standing on the other side of the street.

95
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,308
He was standing there on our way to the park,

96
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,408
and looking in the distance back then too.

97
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,408
I wonder what he's looking at.

98
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:04,708
Maybe somebody looks to be falling from a high place?

99
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,408
Let's go, ask him!

100
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,809
Yes!

101
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:15,309
Ahead of him. An apartment?

102
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,209
Hey, there. What on earth are you...

103
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,408
The lady's... the lady was killed!

104
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,508
What?

105
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,809
Did you see her get killed?

106
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,708
I didn't but she told me this.

107
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,808
"There are going to be three men"

108
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,608
"coming into my room one after the other now."

109
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:41,508
"If after those men leave,"

110
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,108
"I don't come out of the room."

111
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:49,208
"I would probably have been killed, so call the police."

112
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,108
Which means that the lady...

113
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,608
She hasn't come out.

114
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,908
It's already been about 30 minutes

115
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,909
since the third man came out and yet...

116
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,508
And, did you call the police?

117
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,708
I'm so frightened that I haven't called them yet.

118
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,708
The three men.

119
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,308
Do you remember what they were like?

120
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:12,508
Yeah.

121
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,708
A big man.

122
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,608
A young man with long hair that looked like a woman.

123
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,908
An old man with super white hair.

124
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,409
What?

125
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,608
A large brawny man.

126
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,008
An effeminate man.

127
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,808
An aged man.

128
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:34,208
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

129
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,208
I guess it fits in too good to be a coincidence.

130
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,608
But, I'm sure there was another characteristic about Rum.

131
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,008
Although descriptions of his outward appearances were varied...

132
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,808
The characteristic was always the same.

133
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,308
I can't remember what it was though.

134
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:55,008
Will you take us to the lady's room?

135
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,208
It's that apartment, isn't it?

136
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,809
Yes.

137
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:10,408
And? This lady is your aunt?

138
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,308
Your relative?

139
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,408
Nope.

140
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,308
I don't know the lady.

141
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:18,008
-What? -She's a total stranger to you?

142
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,009
Yes.

143
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,308
She used to play with me a lot when I played in the park alone.

144
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:27,308
Because I just moved over here, and have no friends.

145
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:32,408
But, your mother knows about that lady, right?

146
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,908
No, she doesn't.

147
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,008
Because I don't have a mom or dad.

148
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,608
Oh...

149
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:41,808
Yes. While I was on excursion,

150
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,208
they got messed up in the "Goto" murder case.

151
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,808
Goto (Robbery) murder case!

152
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:51,508
That's why I'm staying at my uncle's place right now,

153
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:54,708
but he's too busy and can't play with me.

154
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,208
So, that lady who saw how lonely you were

155
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,908
decided to keep you company playing.

156
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,008
Yes. I told her before that I wanted to go to her house,

157
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,008
but she wouldn't let me.

158
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,208
Today, she told me that it was special and invited me over!

159
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,608
She makes scripts for TV dramas.

160
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:17,508
And told me many, many stories of the scripts

161
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,908
she was going to write about from now!

162
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,509
A scriptwriter?

163
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,409
Aunty!

164
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,808
-There's... -No answer.

165
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,609
Wait.

166
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,908
The door's not locked!

167
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,608
No, don't go inside!

168
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,308
She told me that if she didn't come out,

169
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,008
to call the police, leave everything to them,

170
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,808
and to not come inside.

171
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,909
That's...

172
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:50,509
I thought so.

173
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,308
-Aunty. -No! Stay outside!

174
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,508
Haibara, call the police!

175
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,109
Okay.

176
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,808
Shouldn't we call the ambulance too?

177
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,008
No.

178
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,409
Look at her feet!

179
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,908
If this is a real suicide,

180
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,508
the footstool should be knocked over at her feet.

181
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,808
But, there's nothing here.

182
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,908
In other words, somebody killed her

183
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,908
and tried to make it look as if she committed suicide.

184
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:25,608
One of them that he saw probably committed the crime.

185
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:30,408
If about 30 minutes had passed since the third man left here,

186
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,708
it's already too late...

187
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,608
Oh, no...

188
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,109
But, it's strange.

189
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,408
Although being in such a rush, the perp

190
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,808
forgot to put the footstool under her feet to frame a suicide,

191
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:49,409
there are no traces of anyone having left in a hurry.

192
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:53,508
Besides...

193
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,108
There are no Yoshikawa Lines showing that the victim resisted

194
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,108
before being strangled.

195
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:04,708
I can see if the victim was put to sleep and hung at once but...

196
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,608
If the incident was that calculated,

197
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,809
would the footstool be forgotten?

198
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,809
An envelope?

199
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,708
"Tohto Bank" -A bank envelope.

200
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,808
And, it's still new.

201
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,408
Which means,

202
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,309
inside the wallet on the desk...

203
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,308
There should be money that was just withdrawn.

204
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,808
But there's practically nothing left inside.

205
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:39,508
The only thing inside is the detailed statement from a bank ATM.

206
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,908
According to this, 500,000 yen was withdrawn 3 hours ago,

207
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:48,308
and yet that money is nowhere in sight.

208
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:52,209
Which means... is this a robbery homicide?

209
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,909
Well, either way, a sloppy job like this...

210
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,208
is for sure not what they would do.

211
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:03,409
Yeah.

212
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,560
I see.

213
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:20,760
Then, you were asked by that lady to watch her apartment,

214
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:24,660
and after three men came in one after the other,

215
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,860
you came here and discovered this?

216
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:29,961
Yes.

217
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:35,060
The person who died was scriptwriter Yasue Komai, correct?

218
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,860
If this is a homicide,

220
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:41,260
I guess we've got no choice but to find someone

221
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,060
among her acquaintance who has a grudge against her,

222
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,960
and have them come to the police

223
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:48,560
and have him identify the man.

224
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,460
Oh!

225
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:51,760
If you're talking about the three

226
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,860
who were supposed to meet the victim here today,

227
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,360
I've got their names.

228
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:56,660
What?

229
00:12:56,661 --> 00:13:00,760
It's written on the schedule software in the computer on the desk.

230
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,560
After noon today, meet with Ronpei Sakaba,

231
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:08,060
Kuramichi Habanaka, and Denji Shibakaru.

232
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,660
Really?

233
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,760
Yes.

234
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:13,960
It's written in the notebook that was found in the drawer

235
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,960
as well as on the calendar,

236
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,060
so I think there's no doubt about it.

237
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:22,560
And, there is no sight of the 500,000 yen

238
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,660
that she withdrew either.

239
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,860
So, the perp killed her for the money,

240
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:30,360
set it up to look like suicide and fled.

241
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:34,661
Then, let's investigate the identity of the three immediately and...

242
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:38,960
What's the matter?

243
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,560
They...

244
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:41,860
they're there.

245
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:45,260
The ones who were in her room a while ago.

246
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:47,861
The... the three!

247
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,660
No joke?

248
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,260
Can you point to the three

249
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:55,260
without sticking your face out of the railing?

250
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,461
Yes.

251
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,060
-Are they there? -Yes.

252
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,160
Over there. The large brawny man.

253
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:17,760
The young long-haired man diagonally beside him.

254
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,561
And the old man behind him!

255
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:26,261
Inspector Megure!

256
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, I got it!

257
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,861
-Officer Takagi. -Yes, sir!

258
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,660
Hey. Give me a break, officer.

259
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,360
I just came to look because I heard

260
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,360
that something happened in the neighborhood.

261
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:03,060
And yet why do I have to be interrogated?

262
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm just a passerby spectator.

263
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:09,060
Are you saying I look like some wanted criminal?

264
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,160
No. There was an eye-witness

265
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,560
who testified that between the hours of 2pm to 3pm,

266
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,160
the estimated time of death of the victim,

267
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:21,360
you three went into the room of the victim one after the other.

268
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:25,160
The eye-witness also mentioned that

269
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:29,360
he was asked by the victim Ms. Yasue Komai

270
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,960
to watch her apartment

271
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:35,460
because she may be killed by one of the three men

272
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:38,960
that will be coming.

273
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:41,960
Killed? Didn't she commit suicide?

274
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,760
-Suicide? -Because if she had hung herself,

275
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:47,460
wouldn't it normally be considered suicide?

276
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,960
Why do you know that the victim hung herself?

277
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,560
Oh, well...

278
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,760
It seems we can't hide things around here.

279
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm Denji Shibakaru.

280
00:15:58,661 --> 00:15:59,960
I got to know her coincidentally at a pub.

281
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:04,260
We kicked it off good together and were drinking partners.

282
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:06,860
This picture is proof of it.

283
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,560
She told me she wanted to discuss something

284
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,660
that was bothering her so I came.

285
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,960
But, I didn't think she was so cornered as to hang herself.

286
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,760
Then, when you came, she was already...

287
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:21,260
Yeah, so I don't know what was bothering her.

288
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:25,660
If you want to know what is what, you may as well ask these two.

289
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:28,560
Although I don't know who or where they're from.

290
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,360
I...

291
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:35,260
came to get the money she owed me back!

292
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,060
She's been an old friend of mine,

293
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,760
so I lent her a large sum of money

294
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:42,160
but I ended up suddenly needing it for myself

295
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,160
so I came to ask her to return it.

296
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:47,760
Was that amount 500,000 yen?

297
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:50,360
How did you know?

298
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,560
So, is he the one that took the money?

299
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:59,460
I'm the producer of Tohto TV.

300
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:03,060
And had Ms. Komai writing me the script

301
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,260
for the Special Autumn Mystery,

302
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:09,460
and she said she had finished it, I came to pick it up.

303
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,460
Then, where is that script?

304
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,860
I found it right by the entrance,

305
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,860
so took it with me and gave it to the assistant director.

306
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:21,260
Had the victim already hung herself at that time?

307
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,360
Yes.

308
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:26,260
I don't know what was bothering her either

309
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,260
but it was a script written right before deadline,

310
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,760
so I had no time to be thinking about it.

311
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,661
But...

312
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,660
If you see something like that,

313
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:41,261
wouldn't it be normal to call the police?

314
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,760
True. No matter what else may be on your mind.

315
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:47,460
You would, right? For sure.

316
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,460
If you knew the lady that died, the more so!

317
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,760
Why?

318
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,960
It couldn't be that you had reasons

319
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:58,460
for not being able to call the police...

320
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,360
No.

321
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,460
You brat, stay out of this!

322
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:05,460
Who's that boy wearing glasses?

323
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,360
Please don't let outsiders butt in.

324
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:10,960
They're the first discoverers of the corpse

325
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:14,960
that coincidentally happened to be there.

326
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:20,761
Well, it sounds as if you're the actual first discoverers, though.

327
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,660
Well, I'd like to hear you all out individually,

328
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:26,660
so go inside separately, will you?

329
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,060
If... if it's alibi that you need, I've got it!

330
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,560
Alibi?

331
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:34,660
The money was actually supposed to be deposited by 2pm

332
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:38,360
but when I confirmed it at the bank ATM, it wasn't.

333
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:41,661
So, I came here directly to pick it up.

334
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:46,460
I saw her hanging and dead, so I freaked out.

335
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,560
And rushed back to the ATM.

336
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,760
It was my credit card payment due date was today,

337
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,460
so I had to pay with the money I had on hand.

338
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:58,460
And? How's that an alibi?

339
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:03,260
We... well, every ATM has a security camera, right?

340
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:07,360
If you check the time when I left that ATM for a moment and came back,

341
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,160
and calculate the time it takes to make a round trip to that bank,

342
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,060
you'll see that I had no time to commit murder!

343
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:18,460
Well, I don't know if you can call that an alibi but...

344
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,360
it'll help the investigation.

345
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:23,260
Is that bank near here?

346
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,460
Yeah. Pretty close.

347
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:29,860
Then, I'll go with him to that bank and confirm!

348
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:31,761
Okay.

349
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:35,660
While we're waiting, is it okay to smoke?

350
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:38,160
I have a portable ashtray with me.

351
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,960
It's okay but since it's getting windy,

352
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,160
take care not to scatter the ashes around.

353
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:44,661
All right.

354
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,061
The flames... so big!

355
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,660
Sorry, was it smoky?

356
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,561
Oh, not really.

357
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,760
And? You really don't remember

358
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:07,460
in what order the three men came here?

359
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:08,860
Nope.

360
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,861
Although I know it was them.

361
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,060
I guess I've got no other choice

362
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,661
but to ask them for more details after all.

363
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:26,260
I see.

364
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:29,860
You're sure that he was on the security camera of the bank?

365
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,460
Yes.

366
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,961
Is it okay to smoke here?

367
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,761
I guess I'll take a puff too, then.

368
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,660
However, Inspector...

369
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:44,860
He was away from the ATM for more than 40 minutes,

370
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,760
so it won't serve as an alibi at all.

371
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:50,560
It doesn't even take 20 minutes to get to that bank you see.

372
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:52,960
Then, why did he go out of his way to say so?

373
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,660
He tried to flee several times on the way,

374
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,860
so maybe that's what he was planning to do.

375
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,860
Darn!

376
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,660
Young lady, would you like to use this?

377
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,761
Oh. Thanks.

378
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,060
Geez.

379
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:08,560
You don't have to glare at me like that.

380
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,761
I won't flee anymore!

381
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,861
I was just playing around.

382
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,860
I mean... why don't we hurry

383
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,360
and get on with the interrogation or what not's?

384
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:30,361
Yeah, right.

385
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's start with you, then.

386
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,560
Me?

387
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:39,561
Okay. Be kind, okay?

388
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:20,961
I see.

389
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,360
Did you find something out?

390
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:49,560
Yeah. The perp who committed the murder and...

391
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,360
That boy's name.

392
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,060
Officer Takagi.

393
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:58,860
I think you'd better search the room a little more thoroughly.

394
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:02,060
I'm positive that the 500,000 yen is somewhere inside.

395
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:05,160
-What? -One more thing.

396
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,361
Will you lend me 20,000 yen?

397
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:13,161
