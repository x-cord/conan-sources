1
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,400
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Feeling unpleasant early in the New Year.

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Ran receives a love letter.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,100
A crime gives extra jolt to a shocked heart.

6
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,700
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,300
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,300
And Kitada from Class C

10
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
-was brushed off. -Oh, was the girl Mouri?

11
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Oh, Ran!

12
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,400
Are you going home already?

13
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Sonoko. Yeah.

14
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm thinking of making something good for Conan,

15
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,900
because I've been lazy making meals recently.

16
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Is this what a young and beautiful high school girl should say?

17
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,500
How about you learn something from her, Suzuki?

18
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Shut up!

19
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Okay, I guess I'll go home too then.

20
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Will you wait for me by the shoes box,

21
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
while I go get my bag?

22
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,300
Okay, I get it.

23
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,600
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

24
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,900
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

25
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,100
Don't tell me that this is?

26
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,300
What shall I do?

27
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,000
No. I guess I'll open it at home after all.

28
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran!

29
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,600
Huh? What's this?

30
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,800
Ms. Ran Mouri?

31
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,500
S.H.?

32
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,100
Hey, Ran this is...

33
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,300
It was in my shoes compartment. What shall I do?

34
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,000
What do you mean, what shall I do?

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What else?

36
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,200
"Love Letter to Ran"

37
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Quick, rip it open!

38
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,900
Hold your horses.

39
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,000
"Please forgive me for suddenly sending you a letter like this."

40
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,700
"When I think of you,"

41
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,300
"my heart beats so hard that I can't even sleep at night."

42
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,800
"Please meet me just once."

43
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,900
"Tomorrow after school,"

44
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,700
"I'll be waiting you in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

45
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,100
You did it, Ran! It's a love letter!

46
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,400
He's probably an under classman.

47
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,200
He doesn't know you already have Shinichi.

48
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,300
-Hey! Shinichi has nothing to do with this... -What!

49
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,700
I tell you! You can't even talk safely around here!

50
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Sorry, sorry...

51
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,900
Let's go some place else!

52
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
Wait a second, Sonoko.

53
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,200
A love letter.

54
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,500
Come to think of it, I haven't received any recently.

55
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
How about you, Ran?

56
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
What do you mean?

57
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,900
Don't tell me this is the first time you received one.

58
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
It's my first.

59
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Seriously?

60
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,200
I see, you're with Shinichi all the time

61
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
so nobody can approach you.

62
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,000
I said that Shinichi has nothing to do with this!

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
I wonder who he is?

64
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,900
What?

65
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,700
An alumni of the kendo club, maybe?

66
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,400
See, he's holding a wooden sword.

67
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Never mind him, the love letter's more important!

68
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
-Let's go. -Hey!

69
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,700
And, what are you going to do?

70
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,900
You're going to Beika Park, aren't you?

71
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,800
What shall I do?

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
What are you troubled about?

73
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
Go and turn him down flat.

74
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,900
Tell him that you're already going with somebody.

75
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,200
Just because it doesn't have anything to do with you!

76
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,300
You really seemed troubled.

77
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah.

78
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,500
I guess I have no choice, leave it to me.

79
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,600
-Huh? -I'll refuse very nicely for you.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
What are you going to refuse?

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, glasses kid!

82
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
What're you doing in a place like this?

83
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You look very serious, Ran.

84
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,600
Well, of course, because we were talking about

85
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
the first love letter Ran ever got.

86
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Love letter?

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Sonoko.

88
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,500
My dear Ran,

89
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,600
I would like to hug you and kiss those cute little lips.

90
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
That's not true, Conan.

91
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Nothing like that was written in the letter.

92
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,500
But, it's true that you received a love letter.

93
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
And who was it from?

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,300
Oh, so it bothers you.

95
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,700
You idiot, why would I be?

96
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,400
Maybe it does bother me a bit?

97
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,700
You're really something, kid.

98
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,400
It was from a freshman with the initials S.H.

99
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,100
A freshman?

100
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,400
It said that he wants to meet her tomorrow

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
after school in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,400
That's enough already, Sonoko.

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,600
Since Ran seems to be troubled,

104
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm thinking of going in her place to refuse his request, understand?

105
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Okay, I got it.

106
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
Really, when I'm in this situation...

107
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,200
Who on earth can it be?

108
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,300
What shall I do?

109
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,100
I wonder if I should really let Sonoko handle this?

110
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,800
If he's good looking, I'll make him mine.

111
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,900
I wonder what happened.

112
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
What's the matter?

113
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
Huh?

114
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,600
If you need help, you should ask her to help you.

115
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,300
Her father is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

116
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,100
Hey, Conan.

117
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,800
And her boyfriend is the high school detective,

119
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Shinichi Kudo.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Sonoko.

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,300
I know Detective Mouri

122
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,400
as well as Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

123
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm an alumni of Teitan High School.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,300
You are?

125
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,800
We're sophomore.

126
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
What shall I do?

127
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,000
Since the little boy offered.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Maybe I should ask for help.

129
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,100
Yes. It's okay, isn't it, Ran?

130
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Yes. Well, if it's okay with you...

131
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,300
We'll help you.

132
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,800
Please come in, although it's messy.

133
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,300
-Hello. -Hello.

134
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
That...

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,300
He's my husband. He died a year ago.

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Of an illness.

137
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,100
He was hospitalized for half a year and tried to pull through

138
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,000
but he didn't make it.

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
The fact is...

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
it seems that someone came into the house while we were out.

141
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
Huh?

142
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,800
I was out from about 1 pm,

143
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,200
for about two hours with Yuta.

144
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
And I seemed to have forgotten to to lock that glass door.

145
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,700
Moreover...

146
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,000
I take the rent for this place to the landlord myself,

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
so I went to the bank this morning to withdraw

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,700
the money and put it in this envelope.

149
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,100
It seems that the envelope I had in here

150
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,800
was taken out once.

151
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Taken out?

152
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
But everything was returned, the entire amount.

153
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,700
How do you know that it was taken out once?

154
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
Because of the fold mark,

155
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,500
despite it being new bills, right?

156
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Although it's a very faint fold though.

158
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
See.

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,700
Also...

160
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,000
Although I always leave it here...

161
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,200
There are traces that this diary was read too.

162
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,900
There's still more.

163
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
The most obvious thing,

164
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,300
is that someone placed an incense stick here.

165
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,400
Huh?

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,700
Hey, the incense stick was still lit, right?

167
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,000
About how much was left of it?

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
Well, about half.

169
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,800
Which means that the incense stick was placed

170
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,300
there about 15 minutes ago,

171
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
because incense stick will keep burning for about 30 minutes.

172
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,100
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you, Conan?

173
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
This kid knows a lot about weird things.

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,300
But, I wonder what's going on?

175
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,800
Let's say that someone did come into the house.

176
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,300
The point is who, for what reason came into the house.

177
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,800
Maybe it was a stalker?

178
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,900
I mean going through somebody's diary.

179
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,600
But, other than my diary,

180
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,700
nothing else seems to have been looked into or taken.

181
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
Then it could've been a thief!

182
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,300
But, then the money wouldn't be returned.

183
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,600
Besides, it's unthinkable that a thief would offer incense either.

184
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,700
I felt kind of creepy so I called the officer

185
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
but was told that they have no way of investigating

186
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,100
if nothing was taken.

187
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
The incense stick.

188
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,200
That's what bothers me the most.

189
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
The culprit is her acquaintance,

190
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,500
or her husband's acquaintance.

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,300
Hey, how did you get to know your husband?

192
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,600
Conan!

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,300
He's a really precocious kid.

194
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,200
We used to be classmates in high school.

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,300
But, we didn't think much of each other during high school.

196
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
After graduating from university,

197
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,600
we happened to run into each other on the street,

198
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
and started going with each other.

199
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,800
Then, it's different from you, Ran.

200
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
Of course, it's different!

201
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
You said that your diary was read,

202
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
but what kind of things do you have written in it?

203
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
There's nothing special written in it.

204
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,600
Although I'm busy everyday working and taking care of my son,

205
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
I'll keep myself going thinking of my husband,

206
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
or something like that.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,700
It must be really hard being alone, Yuriko.

208
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,900
There was a time when I thought of committing suicide.

209
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
But, I had my son,

210
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
and after recalling how hard my husband tried to live,

211
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
despite suffering through his illness,

212
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,900
I had second thoughts about doing so.

213
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,000
Not only my husband, but there are many people in this world,

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,300
who cannot live despite wanting to do so.

215
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,500
I thought that I would never be forgiven

216
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,200
if I took my own life despite knowing this.

217
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I can't help but cry.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Maybe,

219
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,500
the culprit felt the same way we feel now.

220
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,200
If so, the culprit...

221
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Just the other day,

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
I saw news on TV that someone came in and robbed the house,

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,300
but changed his mind and left without taking anything.

224
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,900
Really, Conan?

225
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,300
Yes, it was the house of a teacher

226
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,700
that had taken good care of him when he was a child

227
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,200
and he went in without knowing about it.

228
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,000
-Yuriko, are you a school teacher... -No, I'm not.

229
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But even if you weren't a teacher, you could be somebody they know.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
More to the point, you could be somebody special to them.

231
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,700
Maybe I should start writing a diary too.

232
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Moreover, the culprit read the diary of that special person!

233
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,900
The diary of someone who is living with all her might despite her plight.

234
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,400
I see! That's why he didn't take anything,

235
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,700
offered incense and left!

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,300
That's right.

237
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,100
That special person could be someone

238
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,100
that sent you a love letter during your high school days.

239
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
Come off it, Sonoko.

240
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm seriously thinking this incident over, you know!

241
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm serious too!

242
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
What do you think?

243
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,100
Well, yes. I received such a letter just once.

244
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,500
When?

245
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,300
In January of my senior year.

246
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,700
But, we never talked to each other,

247
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,300
knew each other's face or name either.

248
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,600
We were never in the same class

249
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
all through our years during high school.

250
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,300
But, it seems he used to always watch me,

251
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,500
and it was just that I never noticed.

252
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Indeed genuine one-sided love.

253
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,400
In the letter it said,

254
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,300
"Please meet me in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

255
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,400
What?

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,000
Huh? What?

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,000
And? Did you go?

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
I wasn't sure what to do,

260
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,900
but he was waiting for me there

261
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
so, I told him how I honestly felt.

262
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,000
What did you say?

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,900
I think I said, "I'm really happy of how you feel for me,"

264
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,700
"but my head is filled with wanting to pass the entrance exam for now."

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,000
He went home without saying a word.

266
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,200
"Graduation memorial album"

267
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,800
Let's see...

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,900
He's the one.

269
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,800
"Shuhei Nagai" -Mr. Shuhei Nagai.

270
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
Wait a second, this man...

271
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Nagai came to our high school?

272
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Yuriko, weren't you in the kendo club?

273
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,600
Yes.

274
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
-I was captain of the club in my sophomore year. -Mama!

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,300
Just as I thought!

276
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,600
So, that does it!

277
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
What?

278
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Most likely, he's the one who broke into your house.

279
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
I agree too.

280
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,500
Yuriko, haven't you heard anything about him after you graduated?

281
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,200
I think it was about two years ago.

282
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
I heard a bit about him from my husband's friend.

283
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
I haven't told anyone about Nagai, including my husband,

284
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
so when my husband and his friend was talking,

285
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
Nagai's subject came up as someone who went to school in the same year.

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
He stayed out of university for a year,

287
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,000
but, despite that couldn't get into the university of his choice.

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Even after graduation,

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,800
he ended up working for a company he didn't like.

290
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,300
As a result, he quit the company

291
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,800
and seems to be doing freelance work now.

292
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,200
Could you have by any chance

293
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,900
entered a top-notch university just like that?

294
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,600
I don't know if it was top-notch or what,

295
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,000
but I did get into the university of my choice.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,200
So, that's the story.

297
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,500
What is it, Sonoko?

298
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,800
Will you hear me out?

299
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Hey, hey, are you know what you're doing?

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,100
I'm sure that Shuhei Nagai never forgot you

301
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,100
ever since he met you in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

302
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,000
But he probably couldn't contact you because he had inferiority complex

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
of not being able to enter a top-notch university like you did.

304
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,700
After that, even after going out into the society,

305
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,200
nothing worked out for him.

306
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
He finally runs out of money and comes back

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
to Beikacho where he knows his way around,

308
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,200
with the intention of breaking into a house.

309
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,300
While he goes around looking for the house of rich people,

310
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,900
most probably like mine,

311
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
he notices that the glass window of your house

312
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,400
is slightly opened.

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,800
And after finding out somehow that no one was home.

314
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,600
Then, he happened to notice.

315
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,400
The woman in the picture was who he had one-sidedly fallen in love with

316
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
during his high school days.

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The man in the picture with her also looked familiar.

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He was the classmate from same high school.

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Moreover, seeing the picture on the altar,

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
he realizes that the classmate had passed away.

321
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
He then sees the diary,

322
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,100
although he knows he shouldn't he reads it.

323
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,000
He finds out that she is living

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
with all her might along with her little child.

325
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,900
He also thinks about his classmate who died at the young age of 20.

326
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
He is ashamed of himself for doing what he did,

327
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,600
being as young and healthy as he is.

328
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,200
When I watch Ran practicing karate with all her might,

329
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
myself sometimes think I've got to live with all my might too.

330
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,500
Sonoko.

331
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,000
Shuhei Nagai decides to start life all over again.

332
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So he puts the money back into the envelope

333
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
and he offers incense stick in honour

334
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,400
for his classmates, then he leaves.

335
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,700
And, he made a final trip to the high school that the graduated

336
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
from vowing never to come back to this town again.

337
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,900
It just so happened that the kendo club was practicing.

338
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,900
Back then, he was recalling memories of you

339
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
and soaking in deep emotion.

340
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,400
So, he could be at Beika Park looking at the fountain just around now.

341
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,100
No.

342
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,800
You're fantastic, Sonoko!

343
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It's very similar to mine.

344
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Wait a second.

345
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,200
The Nagai that we saw in front of the gym

346
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,600
seemed a bit different from your deduction, Sonoko.

347
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,000
He seemed, well sort of, a bit more desperate.

348
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Is that so?

349
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Besides, it kind of bothered me that he was holding a wooden sword too.

350
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
-A wooden sword? -Yes.

351
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,400
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

352
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,200
To be honest,

353
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,300
there is one thing I didn't tell you all about.

354
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Ten days ago, I had a slight accident

355
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,100
with a man who was riding a bicycle.

356
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,200
Back then, he told me that he was just fine,

357
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,600
but he later came to tell me that he started having neck problems.

358
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,700
That's...

359
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,900
I told him that I'd pay for his medical bills,

360
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
but he asked me date with him

361
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,200
in place of paying for the medical bills.

362
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,500
He was very persistent.

363
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,000
How terrible!

364
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
He seemed to be of bad character,

365
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,300
so I was scared that if I refused too strongly,

366
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,900
he would to something to Yuta.

367
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
That's why I didn't tell anybody about this.

368
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,000
Where is that man today?

369
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He's out on a business trip till sundown.

370
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,700
That's why I know it's not him who broke in.

371
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,000
Everything you just told us is written in your diary, isn't it?

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes.

373
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,600
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

374
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,700
Maybe...

375
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,800
What's with you?

376
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,700
Are you that woman's man?

377
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
No!

378
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,400
Stay, stay away from her.

379
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Keep your hands off her son too.

380
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,200
What? I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

381
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,100
Why you?

382
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,600
"Ryujin Real Estate Company"

383
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Conan?

384
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,000
Hey, hey! Are you gone already?

385
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,500
-Don't touch her. -What?

386
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,800
Don't go near her.

387
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,900
What? I can't hear you.

388
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
Nagai!

389
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
What's with you guys?

390
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,600
What is it, kid?

391
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,700
Hey, it's strange, mister.

392
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,200
Your neck moves?

393
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,600
-You filthy kid! -A scum like you!

394
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
What do you want young lady?

395
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,900
Your neck is really in trouble now, mister!

396
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,200
Nagai!

397
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,700
Are you all right, Nagai?

398
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
I'm sorry, I...

399
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,600
Read your diary.

400
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
It's okay, you don't have to say anything.

401
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
I...

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,900
Wanted to help you.

403
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,300
11 years ago.

404
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,500
Huh?

405
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,000
11 years ago, I was really happy

406
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
when you came to the park.

407
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,700
I didn't think you would come.

408
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,500
Nagai.

409
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
I'll go see him myself, after all.

410
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,200
What?

411
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,500
Well, I don't know how to put it,

412
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,400
but I'll tell him how I honestly feel.

413
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
I think that I should act in good faith to the one who sent me the letter.

414
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,700
Yes. I think it's best you do too.

415
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
"Beika Park"

416
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
I made it.

417
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,200
Jeez.

418
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,600
Ran was saying that

419
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,400
she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

420
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

421
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,800
I'm sorry.

422
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,300
I wrote that I'd be waiting here

423
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,000
and yet I made you wait instead.

424
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Which means...

425
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,900
What?

426
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,600
I'm your fan, the captain of the karate club!

427
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
Please accept this.

428
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,700
Thank you.

429
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Please keep up your good work!

430
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Goodbye!

431
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,700
What's going on?

432
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
It wasn't a freshman boy.

433
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,200
Sonoko? Conan too?

434
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,300
I thought that today for sure

435
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,900
I would be able to hear how you truly feel and yet.

436
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Too bad!

437
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
But popular with girls,

438
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,800
just as expected of you, Ran!

439
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
"Next Episode" -A girl that resembles Haibara!

440
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
She got involved in some sort of accident

441
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
or maybe...

442
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,700
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

443
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,700
That accident...

444
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,500
When did that traffic accident happen?

445
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Next Conan,

446
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,900
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

447
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,900
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
"A girl who looks like Ai Haibara"

449
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,300
Haibara, you sure act like an adult.

450
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,700
I'll bet you're lying about your age.
