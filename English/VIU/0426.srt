1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,549
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,249
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,649
Feeling unpleasant early in the New Year.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,849
Ran receives a love letter.

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,949
A crime gives extra jolt to a shocked heart.

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,549
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,149
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,150
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:59,610
And Kitada from Class C

10
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,610
-was brushed off. -Oh, was the girl Mouri?

11
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,410
Oh, Ran!

12
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,711
Are you going home already?

13
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,710
Sonoko. Yeah.

14
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,710
I'm thinking of making something good for Conan,

15
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,211
because I've been lazy making meals recently.

16
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,110
Is this what a young and beautiful high school girl should say?

17
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:19,810
How about you learn something from her, Suzuki?

18
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:22,010
Shut up!

19
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,010
Okay, I guess I'll go home too then.

20
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,310
Will you wait for me by the shoes box,

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,110
while I go get my bag?

22
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,611
Okay, I get it.

23
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:33,911
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

24
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,211
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

25
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,410
Don't tell me that this is?

26
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,611
What shall I do?

27
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,310
No. I guess I'll open it at home after all.

28
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,711
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran!

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,911
Huh? What's this?

30
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,110
Ms. Ran Mouri?

31
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,810
S.H.?

32
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,411
Hey, Ran this is...

33
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:12,610
It was in my shoes compartment. What shall I do?

34
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,310
What do you mean, what shall I do?

35
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,311
What else?

36
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:23,510
"Love Letter to Ran"

37
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,510
Quick, rip it open!

38
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:28,211
Hold your horses.

39
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:37,310
"Please forgive me for suddenly sending you a letter like this."

40
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,010
"When I think of you,"

41
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,610
"my heart beats so hard that I can't even sleep at night."

42
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,110
"Please meet me just once."

43
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,210
"Tomorrow after school,"

44
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:48,010
"I'll be waiting you in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

45
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,411
You did it, Ran! It's a love letter!

46
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,710
He's probably an under classman.

47
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,510
He doesn't know you already have Shinichi.

48
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,611
-Hey! Shinichi has nothing to do with this... -What!

49
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,010
I tell you! You can't even talk safely around here!

50
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,411
Sorry, sorry...

51
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,210
Let's go some place else!

52
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:09,810
Wait a second, Sonoko.

53
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,510
A love letter.

54
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:13,810
Come to think of it, I haven't received any recently.

55
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,310
How about you, Ran?

56
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,110
What do you mean?

57
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,210
Don't tell me this is the first time you received one.

58
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,610
It's my first.

59
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,310
Seriously?

60
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:26,510
I see, you're with Shinichi all the time

61
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,710
so nobody can approach you.

62
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,311
I said that Shinichi has nothing to do with this!

63
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,910
I wonder who he is?

64
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,210
What?

65
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,010
An alumni of the kendo club, maybe?

66
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,710
See, he's holding a wooden sword.

67
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:44,510
Never mind him, the love letter's more important!

68
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,111
-Let's go. -Hey!

69
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,010
And, what are you going to do?

70
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,210
You're going to Beika Park, aren't you?

71
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,110
What shall I do?

72
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,810
What are you troubled about?

73
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,010
Go and turn him down flat.

74
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,210
Tell him that you're already going with somebody.

75
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,511
Just because it doesn't have anything to do with you!

76
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,610
You really seemed troubled.

77
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,710
Yeah.

78
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,810
I guess I have no choice, leave it to me.

79
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,911
-Huh? -I'll refuse very nicely for you.

80
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,910
What are you going to refuse?

81
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,810
Oh, glasses kid!

82
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,810
What're you doing in a place like this?

83
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:26,810
You look very serious, Ran.

84
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:29,910
Well, of course, because we were talking about

85
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,910
the first love letter Ran ever got.

86
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,110
Love letter?

87
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,110
Sonoko.

88
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,810
My dear Ran,

89
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:40,910
I would like to hug you and kiss those cute little lips.

90
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,610
That's not true, Conan.

91
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,610
Nothing like that was written in the letter.

92
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,810
But, it's true that you received a love letter.

93
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,310
And who was it from?

94
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,610
Oh, so it bothers you.

95
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,010
You idiot, why would I be?

96
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,710
Maybe it does bother me a bit?

97
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,010
You're really something, kid.

98
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,710
It was from a freshman with the initials S.H.

99
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,410
A freshman?

100
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,710
It said that he wants to meet her tomorrow

101
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,510
after school in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

102
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,710
That's enough already, Sonoko.

103
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,910
Since Ran seems to be troubled,

104
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:15,110
I'm thinking of going in her place to refuse his request, understand?

105
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,810
Okay, I got it.

106
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,210
Really, when I'm in this situation...

107
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,510
Who on earth can it be?

108
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,610
What shall I do?

109
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,410
I wonder if I should really let Sonoko handle this?

110
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,111
If he's good looking, I'll make him mine.

111
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,211
I wonder what happened.

112
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,210
What's the matter?

113
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,410
Huh?

114
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,911
If you need help, you should ask her to help you.

115
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,610
Her father is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

116
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,410
Hey, Conan.

117
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,610
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,110
And her boyfriend is the high school detective,

119
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,310
Shinichi Kudo.

120
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,510
Sonoko.

121
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,610
I know Detective Mouri

122
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,710
as well as Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

123
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,310
I'm an alumni of Teitan High School.

124
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,610
You are?

125
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:05,110
We're sophomore.

126
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,710
What shall I do?

127
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,310
Since the little boy offered.

128
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,110
Maybe I should ask for help.

129
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,410
Yes. It's okay, isn't it, Ran?

130
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,010
Yes. Well, if it's okay with you...

131
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:19,611
We'll help you.

132
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,110
Please come in, although it's messy.

133
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,611
-Hello. -Hello.

134
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,310
That...

135
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,611
He's my husband. He died a year ago.

136
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,110
Of an illness.

137
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:36,410
He was hospitalized for half a year and tried to pull through

138
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,311
but he didn't make it.

139
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,510
The fact is...

140
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,210
it seems that someone came into the house while we were out.

141
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:48,710
Huh?

142
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,110
I was out from about 1 pm,

143
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,510
for about two hours with Yuta.

144
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:57,110
And I seemed to have forgotten to to lock that glass door.

145
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,010
Moreover...

146
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,310
I take the rent for this place to the landlord myself,

147
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:04,310
so I went to the bank this morning to withdraw

148
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:06,010
the money and put it in this envelope.

149
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,410
It seems that the envelope I had in here

150
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:10,110
was taken out once.

151
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,910
Taken out?

152
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,610
But everything was returned, the entire amount.

153
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:19,010
How do you know that it was taken out once?

154
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,210
Because of the fold mark,

155
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,810
despite it being new bills, right?

156
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,310
Right.

157
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,610
Although it's a very faint fold though.

158
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,310
See.

159
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,010
Also...

160
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,311
Although I always leave it here...

161
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:38,510
There are traces that this diary was read too.

162
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:40,210
There's still more.

163
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:42,110
The most obvious thing,

164
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,610
is that someone placed an incense stick here.

165
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:45,710
Huh?

166
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:49,010
Hey, the incense stick was still lit, right?

167
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,310
About how much was left of it?

168
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,910
Well, about half.

169
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,110
Which means that the incense stick was placed

170
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,610
there about 15 minutes ago,

171
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:01,210
because incense stick will keep burning for about 30 minutes.

172
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,410
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you, Conan?

173
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:06,410
This kid knows a lot about weird things.

174
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,610
But, I wonder what's going on?

175
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:12,110
Let's say that someone did come into the house.

176
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,610
The point is who, for what reason came into the house.

177
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:17,110
Maybe it was a stalker?

178
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,210
I mean going through somebody's diary.

179
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,910
But, other than my diary,

180
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:24,010
nothing else seems to have been looked into or taken.

181
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,710
Then it could've been a thief!

182
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,610
But, then the money wouldn't be returned.

183
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,911
Besides, it's unthinkable that a thief would offer incense either.

184
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:38,010
I felt kind of creepy so I called the officer

185
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,110
but was told that they have no way of investigating

186
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,410
if nothing was taken.

187
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,010
The incense stick.

188
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,510
That's what bothers me the most.

189
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,510
The culprit is her acquaintance,

190
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:51,810
or her husband's acquaintance.

191
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,611
Hey, how did you get to know your husband?

192
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:56,910
Conan!

193
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,610
He's a really precocious kid.

194
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,510
We used to be classmates in high school.

195
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:06,610
But, we didn't think much of each other during high school.

196
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:07,611
After graduating from university,

197
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,910
we happened to run into each other on the street,

198
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,410
and started going with each other.

199
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,110
Then, it's different from you, Ran.

200
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,810
Of course, it's different!

201
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,510
You said that your diary was read,

202
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,710
but what kind of things do you have written in it?

203
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:23,510
There's nothing special written in it.

204
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,910
Although I'm busy everyday working and taking care of my son,

205
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,110
I'll keep myself going thinking of my husband,

206
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,310
or something like that.

207
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:35,011
It must be really hard being alone, Yuriko.

208
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,211
There was a time when I thought of committing suicide.

209
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,710
But, I had my son,

210
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,210
and after recalling how hard my husband tried to live,

211
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,810
despite suffering through his illness,

212
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,210
I had second thoughts about doing so.

213
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,310
Not only my husband, but there are many people in this world,

214
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,610
who cannot live despite wanting to do so.

215
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,810
I thought that I would never be forgiven

216
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:02,511
if I took my own life despite knowing this.

217
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:07,111
I can't help but cry.

218
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,710
Maybe,

219
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,810
the culprit felt the same way we feel now.

220
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:16,510
If so, the culprit...

221
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,310
Just the other day,

222
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,910
I saw news on TV that someone came in and robbed the house,

223
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:25,610
but changed his mind and left without taking anything.

224
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,210
Really, Conan?

225
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,610
Yes, it was the house of a teacher

226
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:32,010
that had taken good care of him when he was a child

227
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,510
and he went in without knowing about it.

228
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:39,310
-Yuriko, are you a school teacher... -No, I'm not.

229
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:43,310
But even if you weren't a teacher, you could be somebody they know.

230
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,910
More to the point, you could be somebody special to them.

231
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:49,010
Maybe I should start writing a diary too.

232
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:52,910
Moreover, the culprit read the diary of that special person!

233
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:57,210
The diary of someone who is living with all her might despite her plight.

234
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,710
I see! That's why he didn't take anything,

235
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,010
offered incense and left!

236
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,610
That's right.

237
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,410
That special person could be someone

238
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:09,410
that sent you a love letter during your high school days.

239
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:10,810
Come off it, Sonoko.

240
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,710
I'm seriously thinking this incident over, you know!

241
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,610
I'm serious too!

242
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,310
What do you think?

243
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:21,410
Well, yes. I received such a letter just once.

244
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:22,810
When?

245
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,610
In January of my senior year.

246
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,010
But, we never talked to each other,

247
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:30,610
knew each other's face or name either.

248
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,910
We were never in the same class

249
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,910
all through our years during high school.

250
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:38,610
But, it seems he used to always watch me,

251
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,810
and it was just that I never noticed.

252
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:43,610
Indeed genuine one-sided love.

253
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,710
In the letter it said,

254
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:48,610
"Please meet me in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

255
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:49,710
What?

256
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,310
Huh? What?

257
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,410
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

258
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,310
And? Did you go?

259
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,110
I wasn't sure what to do,

260
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,210
but he was waiting for me there

261
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,610
so, I told him how I honestly felt.

262
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,310
What did you say?

263
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:07,210
I think I said, "I'm really happy of how you feel for me,"

264
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,010
"but my head is filled with wanting to pass the entrance exam for now."

265
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:14,311
He went home without saying a word.

266
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,511
"Graduation memorial album"

267
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,110
Let's see...

268
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,210
He's the one.

269
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:23,110
"Shuhei Nagai" -Mr. Shuhei Nagai.

270
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,511
Wait a second, this man...

271
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:42,102
Nagai came to our high school?

272
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:46,002
Yuriko, weren't you in the kendo club?

273
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,302
Yes.

274
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:49,702
-I was captain of the club in my sophomore year. -Mama!

275
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,002
Just as I thought!

276
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,302
So, that does it!

277
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:53,502
What?

278
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:56,503
Most likely, he's the one who broke into your house.

279
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,502
I agree too.

280
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:04,203
Yuriko, haven't you heard anything about him after you graduated?

281
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,902
I think it was about two years ago.

282
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,102
I heard a bit about him from my husband's friend.

283
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:13,102
I haven't told anyone about Nagai, including my husband,

284
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,502
so when my husband and his friend was talking,

285
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,303
Nagai's subject came up as someone who went to school in the same year.

286
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:21,202
He stayed out of university for a year,

287
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,702
but, despite that couldn't get into the university of his choice.

288
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:24,703
Even after graduation,

289
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:27,502
he ended up working for a company he didn't like.

290
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,002
As a result, he quit the company

291
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,503
and seems to be doing freelance work now.

292
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,902
Could you have by any chance

293
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:37,602
entered a top-notch university just like that?

294
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,302
I don't know if it was top-notch or what,

295
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,702
but I did get into the university of my choice.

296
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:45,902
So, that's the story.

297
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:48,202
What is it, Sonoko?

298
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,502
Will you hear me out?

299
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,702
Hey, hey, are you know what you're doing?

300
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:56,802
I'm sure that Shuhei Nagai never forgot you

301
00:14:56,803 --> 00:15:01,802
ever since he met you in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

302
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:05,702
But he probably couldn't contact you because he had inferiority complex

303
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,702
of not being able to enter a top-notch university like you did.

304
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:09,402
After that, even after going out into the society,

305
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:10,902
nothing worked out for him.

306
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:12,702
He finally runs out of money and comes back

307
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,302
to Beikacho where he knows his way around,

308
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:16,902
with the intention of breaking into a house.

309
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:19,002
While he goes around looking for the house of rich people,

310
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,602
most probably like mine,

311
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:23,802
he notices that the glass window of your house

312
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:27,102
is slightly opened.

313
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:30,503
And after finding out somehow that no one was home.

314
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,302
Then, he happened to notice.

315
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:43,102
The woman in the picture was who he had one-sidedly fallen in love with

316
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,702
during his high school days.

317
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:47,702
The man in the picture with her also looked familiar.

318
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:49,702
He was the classmate from same high school.

319
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,702
Moreover, seeing the picture on the altar,

320
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:54,903
he realizes that the classmate had passed away.

321
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:58,202
He then sees the diary,

322
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,802
although he knows he shouldn't he reads it.

323
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:03,702
He finds out that she is living

324
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,102
with all her might along with her little child.

325
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:10,602
He also thinks about his classmate who died at the young age of 20.

326
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,002
He is ashamed of himself for doing what he did,

327
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:16,302
being as young and healthy as he is.

328
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:20,902
When I watch Ran practicing karate with all her might,

329
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:23,902
myself sometimes think I've got to live with all my might too.

330
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,203
Sonoko.

331
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:30,702
Shuhei Nagai decides to start life all over again.

332
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,702
So he puts the money back into the envelope

333
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,102
and he offers incense stick in honour

334
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:39,103
for his classmates, then he leaves.

335
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:46,402
And, he made a final trip to the high school that the graduated

336
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:49,403
from vowing never to come back to this town again.

337
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,603
It just so happened that the kendo club was practicing.

338
00:16:57,103 --> 00:17:00,602
Back then, he was recalling memories of you

339
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,602
and soaking in deep emotion.

340
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:06,103
So, he could be at Beika Park looking at the fountain just around now.

341
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:08,802
No.

342
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,502
You're fantastic, Sonoko!

343
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,503
It's very similar to mine.

344
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:17,202
Wait a second.

345
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,902
The Nagai that we saw in front of the gym

346
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:23,302
seemed a bit different from your deduction, Sonoko.

347
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:26,702
He seemed, well sort of, a bit more desperate.

348
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,302
Is that so?

349
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:32,302
Besides, it kind of bothered me that he was holding a wooden sword too.

350
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,903
-A wooden sword? -Yes.

351
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:40,103
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

352
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,902
To be honest,

353
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:47,002
there is one thing I didn't tell you all about.

354
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,902
Ten days ago, I had a slight accident

355
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,803
with a man who was riding a bicycle.

356
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:55,902
Back then, he told me that he was just fine,

357
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:59,302
but he later came to tell me that he started having neck problems.

358
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,402
That's...

359
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,602
I told him that I'd pay for his medical bills,

360
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,602
but he asked me date with him

361
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,902
in place of paying for the medical bills.

362
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:09,202
He was very persistent.

363
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:10,702
How terrible!

364
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,502
He seemed to be of bad character,

365
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,002
so I was scared that if I refused too strongly,

366
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:17,602
he would to something to Yuta.

367
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,602
That's why I didn't tell anybody about this.

368
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,702
Where is that man today?

369
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,702
He's out on a business trip till sundown.

370
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:27,402
That's why I know it's not him who broke in.

371
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:31,702
Everything you just told us is written in your diary, isn't it?

372
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:33,102
Yes.

373
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:36,302
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

374
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:37,403
Maybe...

375
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:46,502
What's with you?

376
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:48,402
Are you that woman's man?

377
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,202
No!

378
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,103
Stay, stay away from her.

379
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:58,402
Keep your hands off her son too.

380
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,903
What? I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

381
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,803
Why you?

382
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,303
"Ryujin Real Estate Company"

383
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,303
Conan?

384
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:25,703
Hey, hey! Are you gone already?

385
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:29,202
-Don't touch her. -What?

386
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:33,502
Don't go near her.

387
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,602
What? I can't hear you.

388
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:36,803
Nagai!

389
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:41,303
What's with you guys?

390
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:48,302
What is it, kid?

391
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,402
Hey, it's strange, mister.

392
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:53,902
Your neck moves?

393
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:57,302
-You filthy kid! -A scum like you!

394
00:19:57,303 --> 00:19:59,503
What do you want young lady?

395
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,602
Your neck is really in trouble now, mister!

396
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:09,903
Nagai!

397
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,402
Are you all right, Nagai?

398
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,402
I'm sorry, I...

399
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,302
Read your diary.

400
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,502
It's okay, you don't have to say anything.

401
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:21,702
I...

402
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,603
Wanted to help you.

403
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:28,002
11 years ago.

404
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,202
Huh?

405
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:32,702
11 years ago, I was really happy

406
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,703
when you came to the park.

407
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:39,403
I didn't think you would come.

408
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,203
Nagai.

409
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:51,602
I'll go see him myself, after all.

410
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:52,902
What?

411
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,202
Well, I don't know how to put it,

412
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:58,102
but I'll tell him how I honestly feel.

413
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:02,103
I think that I should act in good faith to the one who sent me the letter.

414
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,403
Yes. I think it's best you do too.

415
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:40,103
"Beika Park"

416
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,703
I made it.

417
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,903
Jeez.

418
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:55,302
Ran was saying that

419
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:59,102
she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

420
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,203
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

421
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,502
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,002
I wrote that I'd be waiting here

423
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:11,703
and yet I made you wait instead.

424
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,302
Which means...

425
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:15,602
What?

426
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,302
I'm your fan, the captain of the karate club!

427
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:20,902
Please accept this.

428
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,402
Thank you.

429
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,602
Please keep up your good work!

430
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,703
Goodbye!

431
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:30,402
What's going on?

432
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,402
It wasn't a freshman boy.

433
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:34,903
Sonoko? Conan too?

434
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:39,002
I thought that today for sure

435
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,602
I would be able to hear how you truly feel and yet.

436
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,102
Too bad!

437
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:45,102
But popular with girls,

438
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:46,503
just as expected of you, Ran!

439
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,202
"Next Episode" -A girl that resembles Haibara!

440
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:04,502
She got involved in some sort of accident

441
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,102
or maybe...

442
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:09,403
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

443
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,402
That accident...

444
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:14,203
When did that traffic accident happen?

445
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:24,702
Next Conan,

446
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:28,603
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

447
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,602
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:48,602
"A girl who looks like Ai Haibara"

449
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:51,002
Haibara, you sure act like an adult.

450
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,403
I'll bet you're lying about your age.
