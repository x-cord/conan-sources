1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,266
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,066
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,566
Today's subtitle is a kind of doodad!

4
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,366
You'll see why after watching the episode.

5
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:08,966
The dying message points to the killer!

6
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,366
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:13,867
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,908
Get out!

10
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,408
Ouch.

11
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,508
What do you think you're doing, Dad?

12
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,808
Cut out the violence.

13
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,308
Don't ever show your face before me again!

14
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,009
Please calm down, Mr. Umezu.

15
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,508
"Osamu Umezu (60)" -You wander here and there, and never visited,

16
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,308
but the minute I finish moving house,

17
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,609
you suddenly appear, saying "Give me money"?

18
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,108
I don't ever want to see your face again!

19
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,608
Dad, wait.

20
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:24,008
Your blood pressure will rise if you get mad.

21
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,108
Shut up!

22
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,608
Get out of here!

23
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:27,609
Excuse me.

24
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,808
Pops!

25
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:31,208
I'm sorry!

26
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,408
Mr. Mouri.

27
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,408
Mr. Umezu, this is Mr. Mouri who I was talking about.

28
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,909
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:45,009
"Conan: A Strange Child"

30
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,509
I've heard about your high reputation.

31
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,208
Here's some tea.

32
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,708
Thank you.

33
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,208
Mr. Umezu,

34
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,508
I'm sorry to intrude at a busy time like this when you just moved in.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,808
Takashi, we have a guest.

36
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,009
"Takashi Umezu (25)" -Go on home.

37
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,308
I'm not finished talking to you.

38
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,808
Although it's an unlucky story...

39
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,408
Some people saw me take illegal drugs, and I'm being blackmailed.

40
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,408
They said that they're going to squeak to the police.

41
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,208
If that happens,

42
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,708
your name will be publicized by the mass media

43
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,408
and maybe you'll have to live an unlucky life too, Dad.

44
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,908
You're a nominee for some literary award, right?

45
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,008
If I get caught, won't it be minus image for you?

46
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,108
They say that they won't turn me in depending on how much I give them.

47
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,008
Lucky story, don't you think?

48
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,009
So...

49
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,508
You got to be kidding!

50
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,008
What happens to you is none of my business!

51
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,608
Get going home!

52
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:34,908
Excuse me,

53
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,908
but this thing about being blackmailed is quite disquieting.

54
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,508
Please don't take what he says seriously.

55
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,209
He's just making up stories to get money from me.

56
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,108
Sonny, do you want some gum?

57
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,908
Gum helps keep the brain active.

58
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,208
Thank you.

59
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,209
I'll take it.

60
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,209
"Touru Mikami (30)"

61
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,508
Who are they?

62
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,908
Detective Kogoro Mouri and Conan.

63
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,708
I have read "The road to the 13th Stairs" and was deeply impressed.

64
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,508
So I came to get your autograph to keep it as a family treasure.

65
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,908
Dad's book as a family treasure?

66
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,508
Maybe it's written by a ghostwriter?

67
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:21,308
Many senior's publish books are written by their disciples, right?

68
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:23,209
Takashi, watch your words.

69
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:28,208
You're the one doing the writing, aren't you, Ms. Araki?

70
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,708
"Chika Araki (27)" -What?

71
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,009
I thought so.

72
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:36,608
I don't need the money, Dad.

73
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,508
I'll write memoirs.

74
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,408
"Son Says Father's Best Sellers Are Written By Ghost Writer."

75
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,409
Takashi!

76
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,708
How despicable can you get?

77
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,808
Mr. Umezu, please calm down!

78
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,108
Excuse me...

79
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,508
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

80
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,208
Would you wait for us at the cafe outside?

81
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,209
All right.

82
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,708
You can never tell about people.

83
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:13,409
I thought he had money and fame, and no worries whatsoever.

84
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,608
I'm sorry for what happened, Mr. Mouri.

85
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,908
Mr. Umezu's autograph is in the book.

86
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,808
Thank you.

87
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,908
And where is he now?

88
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,108
He is dispirited.

89
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,508
A bit depressed.

90
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,008
He may look to be a dynamic character,

91
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,208
but he's quite concerned about how others view him.

92
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,208
Isn't that Ms. Araki?

93
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,308
Yes. She's going to the police

94
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,708
for an interview in place of Mr. Umezu.

95
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,708
It's not easy to be a writer, is it?

96
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,508
Mr. Mikami, what's the truth?

97
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:48,908
About what?

98
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,708
About Ms. Chika Araki being a ghostwriter.

99
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,208
Not you too, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,108
You believe Takashi's lie?

101
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:59,308
No, it's not that.

102
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,609
It's baloney.

103
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,308
That button is unusual.

104
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:07,208
You mean this?

105
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,708
Mr. Umezu passed it out to all personnel involved

106
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,108
since his book made a big hit.

107
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,608
It's cloisonne work made in the image of a peony.

108
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,008
A peony button.

109
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,908
I guess I'll be on my way, then.

110
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,508
Already?

111
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,208
I have an appointment at a television station from now.

112
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,009
If you will excuse me.

113
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:30,508
Mr. Mikami sure is a busy man.

114
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,708
A novelist.

115
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,508
Not bad.

116
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,108
I'm going to become a popular novelist.

117
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:38,109
I've made up my mind.

118
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,408
I already bought manuscript papers and pens.

119
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,508
All you need now is talent.

120
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,509
Yeah.

121
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,509
What?

122
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,509
Huh?

123
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,008
Mr. Mikami?

124
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,508
Mr. Umezu is not answering the phone?

125
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,608
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:00,008
Since I was bothered about him being depressed, I called him.

127
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,009
But...

128
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,308
No, I'm sure I'm just taking my worries overboard.

129
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,708
I'll be able to handle this alone.

130
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,708
No. Let me go with you.

131
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,508
I haven't thanked Mr. Umezu either.

132
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,009
And I would also like to ask what things a novelist should...

133
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,508
Mr. Umezu!

134
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,008
Can you hear me, Mr. Umezu?

135
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,908
This way, this way! Hurry!

136
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,108
Let's see.

137
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:23,909
The spare key for room 503 is...

138
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:26,909
Mr. Umezu!

139
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,309
Mr. Umezu!

140
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,508
Mr. Umezu!

141
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,308
Mr. Mouri, please call an ambulance!

142
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:36,108
Please call the ambulance right away!

143
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,209
Hurry!

144
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,308
No, I'm sorry,

145
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,609
but there's no need for an ambulance.

146
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,808
This is probably some sort of nerve poisoning.

147
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:54,109
Mr. Mouri, something's written.

148
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,408
"My life as a writer has ended.

149
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,808
I feel total emptiness."

150
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,408
It seems to be a suicide note.

151
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,508
Mr. Umezu committed suicide?

152
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,008
Guess so.

153
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,808
He put this poison into his coffee.

154
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,008
There's a suicide note.

155
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,108
Moreover, the front entrance of this room,

156
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:14,908
was locked and closed.

157
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,908
Hey, the window is slightly open.

158
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,909
-Don't tell me someone entered from that window? -No.

159
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,209
At this height...

160
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,109
it's probably impossible to come in from the window.

161
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,709
By the way, what is he holding in his hand?

162
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:39,308
That is a sceptre that's held by a Shinto priest,

163
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,608
which was given to him by a fan as a lucky charm,

164
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:44,308
in hopes that his novel "The Road to the 13th Step"

165
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:46,908
would win the Literary Award.

166
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,508
The sceptre and the award? I don't understand.

167
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,208
It seems that this sceptre is made from an Ichii tree.

168
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,008
Ichii can be written as "first place".

169
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,308
I see.

170
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:02,208
He chose to die, but he wanted to win first place.

171
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,009
He died feeling mortified.

172
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,909
Pops, there's something on the corner of the wastebasket.

173
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:12,609
Blood?

174
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,508
He has a wound on the back of his head.

175
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,908
I wonder if he fell and bumped his head.

176
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,608
If so, the waste basket would've been toppled over, right?

177
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,108
He put it back once on his own and...

178
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,208
No.

179
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,108
A person who's determined to die wouldn't do things like that.

180
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:36,608
If he were to be pushed by somebody and fell...

181
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,009
Do you mean someone killed Mr. Umezu?

182
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,908
Mr. Mikami, what's this envelope?

183
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,808
Mr. Umezu's manuscript.

184
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:49,708
It's the Weekly Nichiyomi, with the essay, "My Secret" inside it.

185
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,008
There were three keys here just a while ago,

186
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,208
but there's only one now.

187
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,508
True.

188
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,808
Maybe Ms. Araki and Takashi took it with them.

189
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:06,008
That means someone was here before the room was locked.

190
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,108
Mr. Mikami,

191
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,609
please contact Inspector Megure of the police department right away.

192
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,959
His woman disciple, Ms. Araki and his son, Takashi.

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,259
Both were pretty close to the victim,

194
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,859
so they could've been waiting for a chance to poison him.

195
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,859
Moreover, there is a possibility that they have the keys.

196
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,659
There isn't anything here that leads to clues regarding the killer.

197
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,559
I'm not sure if this is supposed to be meaningful.

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,359
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,959
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

200
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,259
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

201
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,759
That's it.

202
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,659
There's some kind of doodad in this book.

203
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,159
What kind of doodad is it?

204
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,659
Beats me. It's new to me.

205
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,859
Mr. Umezu.

206
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Mr. Umezu!

207
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,759
Wait a minute!

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,459
Don't touch the corpse.

209
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,459
When you left here, did you take one of the spare keys?

210
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,059
Yes.

211
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Here.

212
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,659
I'll be very straightforward with you.

213
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,259
Mr. Umezu's novel, "The Road to the 13th Step" is a big hit right now,

214
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,459
but I bet that you're not too happy about it?

215
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,159
Just what do you mean?

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,359
Please be honest with me.

217
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,159
You are the real writer of this book,

218
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,059
isn't it, Ms. Chika Araki?

219
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,359
No, I'm not.

220
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,559
I didn't write that book.

221
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,359
You were vexed because Mr. Umezu snatched your work away from you.

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,559
That isn't true!

223
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,259
Mr. Umezu wrote all his novels on his own.

224
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,559
Even if Ms. Araki were to be the culprit,

225
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,360
why was the window open?

226
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,659
This schedule is...

227
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,160
It looks like the scotch tape was peeled off once and stuck back on again.

228
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,459
What's this?

229
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,259
It's slightly puffed up?

230
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,559
Something like a string must have been pulled in through the window.

231
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,759
Ms. Araki, do you know what a dying message is?

232
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,160
Yes, I do.

233
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,459
His dying message is in the sceptre that Mr. Umezu is holding.

234
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,759
A dying message in the sceptre?

235
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,259
The sceptre seems to be made of material

236
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,759
that is taken from the Ichii tree.

237
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,859
While waiting for you, I decided to look it up in a dictionary.

238
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,459
An Ichii tree is also known as an Araragi tree.

239
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,959
Araragi?

240
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,559
Araki and Araragi. They're very similar.

241
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,159
Isn't that just a coincidence?

242
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,659
Why is he holding the sceptre upside down?

243
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,059
There's no meaning to that.

244
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,359
No meaning?

245
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,859
He probably grabbed at it out of desperation,

246
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,359
just as a drowning man would grasp at straw.

247
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,259
Dad died?

248
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,059
Talk about super lucky.

249
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,859
Royalty on the books and the estate are all mine.

250
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,959
Your father just died, and all you have to say is "lucky"?

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Lucky?

252
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,659
This is the key to this room?

253
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,859
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,859
I took it a while ago when Dad wasn't watching.

255
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,359
I was thinking of stealing something valuable when Dad leaves the house,

256
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,559
but I guess I don't need it anymore.

257
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,859
May I do a body check?

258
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,059
Yeah, sure.

259
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,160
Today's my lucky day. I'll let you do anything you want to.

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
What's this?

261
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,059
A drug.

262
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,259
What?

263
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,359
I know nothing!

264
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,959
I didn't kill him!

265
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm not the one who killed Dad!

266
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,859
Mr. Mikami, say something!

267
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,160
Wait!

268
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,659
I've figured it out.

269
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,459
Takashi Umezu,

270
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,860
Mr. Umezu's dying message was referring to you.

271
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,059
Wasn't the message supposed to be Chika Araki?

272
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,059
He made it seem that way,

273
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,859
but there was another message,

274
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,159
and I saw through it.

275
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,959
Another message in the sceptre?

276
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,059
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,959
About the Ichii tree that this sceptre is made of.

278
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
When written in Kanji characters,

279
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,559
the radical is "ki" and beside it is the character "raku".

280
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,959
Inspector, you noticed that the sceptre was upside down.

281
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,559
This was also part of his dying message.

282
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,059
Why was it upside down?

283
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,859
He did not want it to be "ki" and "raku",

284
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,359
but rather "raku" and "ki".

285
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,859
"Raku" and "Ki"?

286
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,059
"Raku" and "Ki",

287
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,159
as in lucky?

288
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,659
This man's favourite word, lucky.

289
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,959
I see!

290
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,659
Just what's that supposed to mean?

291
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
You got to be kidding!

292
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,259
I didn't do it! It's not me!

293
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,559
The sceptre is made out of Ichii.

294
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,159
Ichii.

295
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,360
Maybe...

296
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,459
I see!

297
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,560
I got it!

298
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,460
Somewhere around here...

299
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
I found it!

300
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,459
Let me go! I didn't do it!

301
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,159
I will have you come with me to the station, too.

302
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,659
I have some things to discuss with the publishers and media,

303
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,460
so if you will excuse me.

304
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,359
Conan, where did you go?

305
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm hungry, so we're going home.

306
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,059
Huh?

307
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,859
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

308
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,660
Please wait, Inspector Megure.

309
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,960
Those two are not the killer.

310
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,759
Mouri.

311
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,059
Then, who is?

312
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,959
The only others who have the key to this room

313
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,759
besides Mr. Umezu are these two.

314
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,859
It is possible to enter this room without a key.

315
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,959
Even Mr. Mikami can.

316
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,359
All he has to do is have Mr. Umezu open the window from inside.

317
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,059
Mr. Mikami.

318
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,059
I would like to ask you something.

319
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,059
Would you please tell me what you did

320
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,759
after you parted with me outside the coffee shop?

321
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,259
I called Mr. Umezu on the way to the TV station, but got no answer.

322
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,859
So I came here with you.

323
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,659
Isn't that the wrong order?

324
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,159
After you parted with me, you went to the roof of this condo

325
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,459
and suspended a string that was long enough to reach this room.

326
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,859
Then you had Mr. Umezu open the door for you and went inside.

327
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,260
While his attention was diverted, you poisoned his coffee.

328
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,460
You typed the dying message with the computer.

329
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Then you pulled the string that was hanging from the roof into the room.

330
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,060
You went out and locked the door then head to the roof.

331
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,659
And just in case somebody sees through your trick,

332
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,559
you prepared a killer who is thought to have set up a suicide trick.

333
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,059
That person happened to be Takashi.

334
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,659
In other words, he prepared a guarantee to protect himself.

335
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,959
The poison that came out of Takashi's pocket was probably put inside

336
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,359
when he was arguing with Mr. Umezu.

337
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,759
Mr. Mouri,

338
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,559
that's enough!

339
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,259
Everything you're saying is based on assumption.

340
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,359
You have no proof whatsoever.

341
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,659
That's true.

342
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,759
But Mr. Umezu left a dying message behind.

343
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,859
Dying message again?

344
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,259
It's the third time.

345
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,059
Mr. Umezu was holding the sceptre upside down.

346
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,059
He was hoping that I would figure it out.

347
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,959
Do you remember Mr. Umezu's sentences in his essay?

348
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,259
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

349
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,859
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

350
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,859
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

351
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,759
Please look at the bookshelf.

352
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,159
The secret doodad is there.

353
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,159
"A Chicken, a Bird, and a Crocodile."

354
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,759
"A God? A Wolf?"

355
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,059
"Honey and Sin."

356
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,759
"My Mama's Selfishness Towards Me."

357
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,659
These are all like "shinbunshi",

358
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,759
words that are the same forwards and backwards,

359
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,059
also called palindromes.

360
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,559
Among his works are also titles such as.

361
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,759
"Don't Cry, Papa Don't Cry" and "Oh No, I'm Doomed"

362
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
and many other palindrome titles come to mind.

363
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,659
In other words, sneaking phrases like these secretly into his works

364
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,659
was Mr. Umezu's secret enjoyment.

365
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,959
Mr. Mouri.

366
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,459
Could it be that you suspect me only because my name is Mikami

367
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,659
and can be read from the right or the left and sound the same?

368
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,659
Exactly.

369
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,059
Ridiculous.

370
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,359
That's why I had my eyes on you.

371
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,559
That's when I noticed.

372
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,359
The button that was there when I met you at the coffee shop wasn't there.

373
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,259
The button where the material overlay each other.

374
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,159
Did someone pull it off?

375
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,360
Please let me check.

376
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,259
After you parted with me, you came back here.

377
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,560
Using the method I explained a while ago, you killed Mr. Umezu.

378
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,459
You headed for the television station to create your alibi

379
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,759
and you realized that your button was missing.

380
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,059
If the button is found near Mr. Umezu's body,

381
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,559
everything you thought up till now will go down the drain.

382
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,459
Therefore, you rushed back.

383
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,459
That's where you happened to run into us.

384
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,959
You looked for the button in this room,

385
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,260
but you haven't found it yet.

386
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,259
Yet another thing is still not found, too.

387
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,059
It's gum.

388
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,759
Gum that Mr. Umezu always had in his mouth wasn't found.

389
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,059
Officer Takagi,

390
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,659
please check carefully the area that where Mr. Umezu's body was found.

391
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
I'm sure that the button and gum are still there.

392
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,159
I found it!

393
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,360
-Chiba! -Yes, sir!

394
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Inspector.

395
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,160
Mr. Mikami, this is your button.

396
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
You will admit everything, right?

397
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,959
The novel that I wrote was published under Mr. Umezu's name.

398
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,559
He wouldn't even allow me to talk about the book in public,

399
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,860
since everyone would find out that it was in my style of writing.

400
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,559
Is that why you killed Dad?

401
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,559
You should've kept committing murder just within the books you wrote.

402
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,359
You took the wrong road, Mr. Mikami.

403
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,459
You're lucky, Takashi.

404
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,459
Your father's estate and all his fortune now belongs to you.

405
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,659
Takashi, the timing couldn't have been better.

406
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,259
Inspector Megure will be more than willing to hear you out

407
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,859
about the illegal drug that you're being blackmailed on.

408
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,859
Illegal drug?

409
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,159
No...

410
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,159
I'll hear you out all you want.

411
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,659
Officer Takagi, please take him to the station.

412
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,659
-Yes, sir! -No, just a second...

413
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,860
Please wait!

414
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,259
How about it, Pops?

415
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,760
How's your novel coming along?

416
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,359
I have a bit of a problem.

417
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,359
I'm on a roll at the beginning, but when I get to the conclusion

418
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,459
where the case is to be solved,

419
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,459
I remember absolutely nothing.

420
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,259
Of course you don't.

421
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,159
Because all you did was sleep right through it.

422
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,059
It's strange, isn't it, Pops?

423
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,759
I wonder why I can't remember.

424
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,559
By the way, Conan,

425
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,459
I just thought of something interesting.

426
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,759
Ready?

427
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,259
Weird Conan Weird. How do you like it?

428
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,059
Weird Conan Weird?

429
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,059
That's right! Weird Conan Weird.

430
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,959
Weird Conan Weird.

431
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,260
It's a palindrome.

432
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,860
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,259
"Next Episode."

434
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,359
Blood.

435
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,059
Yoriko wasn't hurt to the point where she was bleeding.

436
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,159
Which means that this is Kinue's blood?

437
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,459
What did you just say?

438
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,059
Musashi did?

439
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,759
Officer Takagi, I'll leave it to you.

440
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,759
Officer Sato, even if I have to risk my own life, I will.

441
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,559
It's probably no mistake that Musashi attacked Kinue.

442
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,959
What did you find this time?

443
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Don't tell me that...

444
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,160
Next Conan, "Good Work, Coeur".

445
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,759
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,459
"Dog brushing teeth."

447
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,759
Weird Conan Weird?

448
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,160
Reading from left to right and vice versa.
