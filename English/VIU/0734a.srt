1
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:17,501
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom!

2
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,401
Flower viewing at a shrine is great too, isn't it?

3
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,901
Really, the weather's nice too.

4
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,101
It's indeed a day for flower viewing.

5
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,801
My stomach is indeed ready for having lunch!

6
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:30,501
Geez Genta.

7
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,601
It's indeed a case of dumplings over flowers.

8
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,401
Then, Doc.

9
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,301
We'll go draw some oracles

10
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,101
so will you save a place for us and spread out the sheet for us as well?

11
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,701
Okay.

12
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,601
Okay, let's go!

13
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,001
-Thank you! -Conan, let's go!

14
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,201
Yeah.

15
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,601
-What is it? -Huh?

16
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,401
Are you looking for something?

17
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,401
Oh, no. Not really.

18
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,801
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

19
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,701
are slashed by the light of deduction.

20
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,601
Information gets complicated under the cherry blossom tree.

21
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,401
A queer case and the FBI.

22
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,001
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,801
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,801
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:58,487
"In Reminiscence of Jodie and the Trap of Flower Viewing"

26
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,587
"Bad Luck"

27
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,687
Of all days, why today?

28
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,687
It says I'm lucky.

29
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,287
Mine says medium lucky!

30
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:15,287
Mine says least luck, so well...

31
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,887
Then let's go tie the oracles!

32
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,287
-Okay! -Hey.

33
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,387
Huh?

34
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:25,587
You drew yourselves good oracles so take them home!

35
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:28,887
You tie oracles in order to leave bad luck behind

36
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,487
and change your day to lucky.

37
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:35,087
It seems that recently a bad custom of tying all oracles

38
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:38,487
have become prevalent.

39
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,187
So, the only one who has to tie the oracle is Conan?

40
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,187
She snuck a look at mine.

41
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,687
And, what did you draw?

42
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,387
Oh, do you want to know?

43
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,187
Not really.

44
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:55,487
If you want to know that badly, why not?

45
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,087
Super lucky?

46
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:03,487
-Wow, Ai! -How lucky!

47
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,687
Will you change it with mine?

48
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:09,087
But I hear that super bad luck is rarely drawn,

49
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,887
so it actually means good luck.

50
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:14,087
Don't let it depress you, cool kid!

51
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,087
Jodie!

52
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,087
Jodie!

53
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:20,287
Hi.

54
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,787
Did you come to view flowers too?

55
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:27,087
Oh, yes! I love cherry blossoms, you see!

56
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,387
I see?

57
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,787
You called Jodie over so that you could

58
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:34,087
talk in secret with her, didn't you?

59
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,587
Huh?

60
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,187
They say that parks and shrines

61
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:41,387
are often used by spies to exchange information.

62
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:44,787
Okay, everybody. Let's go elsewhere.

63
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:48,187
It seems they want to talk in secret, just the two of them.

64
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,187
Okay.

65
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,387
But, well, it's a place

66
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:55,787
where the security police are on the lookout too.

67
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:58,187
Take care.

68
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:00,387
Okay.

69
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:06,687
And? What is it you want to talk to me about?

70
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,087
Well, you said before that

71
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,387
you saw Mr. Akai who had a burn, didn't you?

72
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,187
Yes.

73
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:17,387
During that bank robbery case.

74
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:26,987
Shu?

75
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,087
Hey, hold it!

76
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,587
Shu!

77
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,887
Oh, sorry.

78
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:50,487
Shu...

79
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,987
Are you Shu? You're Shu, aren't you?

80
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,087
Tell me that you're Shu!

81
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,187
A burn scar.

82
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,387
That...

83
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,887
That wasn't Mr. Akai

84
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,287
but one of the members of the men in black,

85
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,687
Bourbon in disguise.

86
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,387
Huh?

87
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:19,087
In order to check if Mr. Akai really died or not,

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,787
he was going around people who knew Mr. Akai

89
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,687
under that disguise.

90
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,287
Because if the FBI were faking his death,

91
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,087
they'd be able to tell by the way you react.

92
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,087
Well, back during the Bell Tree Express incident,

93
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:33,587
it seems that Vermouth herself, was disguised as Mr. Akai,

94
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,887
although she was the one who made

95
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,087
Bourbon disguise himself as Mr. Akai.

96
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,687
Bell Tree Express?

97
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:45,387
That train explosion was their doing too?

98
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:53,287
Yep. It seems so.

99
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,987
Hold it.

100
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:59,687
If that man with the burn was one of them...

101
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:04,087
then, Shu really is...

102
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:11,987
Then, the next time that man with the burn appears,

103
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,987
I'll nab him and peel off his disguise,

104
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:15,587
then expose his identity.

105
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:17,287
I know his identity!

106
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,487
Huh?

107
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,987
-As well as his whereabouts too! -What?

108
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,887
He goes by the name Toru Amuro,

109
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,187
and part-times at the coffee shop Poirot

110
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,287
below the Mouri Detective Agency.

111
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,987
-Why? -I wonder.

112
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,687
That's why I had you come here.

113
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,787
I want the FBI to check on it.

114
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:40,387
On why he's still at Poirot despite having achieved

115
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,787
what he had to do.

116
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,087
Achieved what he had to do?

117
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,587
Yeah, that's...

118
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,487
Huh?

119
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,887
Aren't you the non-Japanese woman

120
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,787
who was held hostage with me during the bank robbery?

121
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:56,087
Huh?

122
00:07:56,087 --> 00:08:00,187
I was diagonally behind you back then,

123
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:03,087
and the one who taped your eyes and mouth with masking tape

124
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,087
was my wife.

125
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,087
Don't you remember me?

126
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,187
Yes, sort of.

127
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:14,687
Then, was that man with the burn scar

128
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,687
who was next to you back then your boyfriend?

129
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:20,687
No. What's with you?

130
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,087
Oh, no.

131
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,187
If not, it's okay.

132
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,687
I saw him two or three days ago, you see.

133
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:30,487
-Huh? -Where? Where'd you see him?

134
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,487
-Answer me! -Huh?

135
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:36,687
Pickpocket! There's a pickpocket!

136
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,787
Ouch.

137
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,287
-Are you all right? -Are you okay? Madam?

138
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,787
Yes.

139
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,687
Somebody put his hand into my bag,

140
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,387
so I was sort of flustered.

141
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,187
It's true that there are a lot of pickpockets

142
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:51,787
around in crowded places like these.

143
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:53,187
Yes.

144
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,387
Yes. It's very true.

145
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,387
We've got to be careful.

146
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,987
Goodbye, then.

147
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,687
No, Genta!

148
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,587
You're not supposed to drink that water.

149
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:22,487
Huh? Oh?

150
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,787
You're supposed to just rinse your mouth

151
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:26,187
and spit it out on the ground!

152
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:29,087
And? You can't remember yet?

153
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,087
Where you saw him?

154
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:34,887
No. I was knocked out in bed because of a cold yesterday

155
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,187
so my memory's...

156
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,487
Your voice is really hoarse.

157
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,987
Then, maybe you should gargle your mouth with this water too?

158
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:47,987
No, thanks. I don't want to give my cold to anyone,

159
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,387
and I already cleansed my hands a while ago.

160
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:52,287
Could it be that you saw him

161
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,687
in front of a coffee vending machine somewhere?

162
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,187
Canned coffee? Does he like it?

163
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:00,487
The man?

164
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,387
Yes. He used to drink a lot of it.

165
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:07,087
Yes, even back when those guys were about to

166
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,787
attack the hospital.

167
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,287
Shu.

168
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,687
Doesn't he look familiar?

169
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,387
He's one of the men who was added to the investigation team.

170
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,987
Beats me.

171
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,487
As for those on the same team.

172
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,787
I don't forget the faces of enemies, though.

173
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,487
Well, it's only natural that he looks familiar.

174
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,187
He's an FBI agent after all.

175
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:33,887
Yes.

176
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:38,587
But, when I look at him, I sense something dangerous.

177
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,387
Shu.

178
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:58,587
He must've been tired to have dropped the canned coffee.

179
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:00,287
Rather, an attack?

180
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,587
Oh no, no!

181
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,487
That man and the man with the burn scar

182
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,687
are two different people.

183
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,587
Never mind already!

184
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,987
If you recall something, contact me here, will you?

185
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,287
Yes, I will.

186
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,887
Strange.

187
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,087
In the Bell Tree Express,

188
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:22,987
Bourbon said that he was convinced that Mr. Akai died, and yet...

189
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:26,887
Why does he still need to disguise himself as Mr. Akai?

190
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,787
What on earth for?

191
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,830
No, Genta! You shouldn't ring it so hard!

192
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,030
But, Dad told me that I should do things like this energetically.

193
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,830
Exactly!

194
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,230
That bell is to let god know that you've come here.

195
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,130
That's why you have to ring it many times

196
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,330
or else god may not notice you've come.

197
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,730
-Oh. -I didn't know that.

198
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,730
Okay!

199
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,830
I'll ring it with all my might then!

200
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,930
-Hey. -Huh?

201
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,130
The man you were talking about a while ago,

202
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,730
that man called Akai, who is he?

203
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,930
Why?

204
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,930
Somehow he sounds like someone I know.

205
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,630
Maybe not.

206
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,630
Besides Mr. Akai is already...

207
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,830
Huh, dead?

208
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,530
-No joke? -Yeah!

209
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,530
There's a big fuss behind the restroom!

210
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,130
Let's go look!

211
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,230
Doc? What's up?

212
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,630
Bad news, Shinichi! It's a homicide!

213
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,430
I seem to have witnessed a murder!

214
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,930
What? You witnessed a murder?

215
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,930
At any rate, rush over here, will you!

216
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,230
They're a lot of spectators here already.

217
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,730
I'm sure you'll find the place right away!

218
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,630
Over there!

219
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,330
And, did you see the perp?

220
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,730
I only got to see the silhouette,

221
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,430
but the perp was flinging a stick about 30cm

222
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,130
and hitting the victim repeatedly.

223
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,630
A stick about 30cm long? Slugged to death!

224
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,130
Hey.

225
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,330
Out of the way, move!

226
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,230
This person.

227
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,530
No joke?

228
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,730
She's the one that bumped into Jodie a while ago.

229
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,430
Why?

230
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,230
Not much time seems to have gone by since she was killed.

231
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,830
A 5 yen coin painted black with a Sharpie.

232
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,130
'Kurobei'!

233
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,730
'Kurobei'?

234
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,530
The nickname of this pickpocket.

235
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,430
She's called by that name because

236
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,330
she sneaks three black 5 yen coins into the pockets

237
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,930
of those she pickpockets.

238
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,830
Why do something like that?

239
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,830
It's rumored to be a play on words.

240
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,330
The five (go) for a 5 yen coin,

241
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,530
the black (kuro) color of the Sharpie, and 3 (san) coins

242
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,930
make up the word "gokurosan" (Thank you).

243
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,130
In other words, thank you for earning money for me

244
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,730
to pickpocket from you.

245
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,130
Officer, this way, this way!

246
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,130
Doc!

247
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,730
Huh? Who are you children?

248
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,530
Get away from the corpse!

249
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,930
I'm an FBI agent Jodie Starling!

250
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,930
FBI?

251
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,930
Block the entrance and exit of this shrine immediately!

252
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,430
-Get the police detectives. -Yes, ma'am!

253
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,630
Then, the perp is that person called Kurobei?

254
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,730
No.

255
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,630
Since the coin purse that she had on her

256
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,330
was filled with black painted coins.

257
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,530
She's probably Kurobei herself!

258
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,530
-Huh? -This pack of bills

259
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,530
that's bundled together with a rubber band inside her wallet.

260
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,830
Inside it...

261
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,430
This is a GPS transmitter.

262
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,130
Transmitter?

263
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,530
If a cell phone is used with only a discrepancy of five meters,

264
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,630
the location can be specified.

265
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,430
If a thing like that were inside the wallet

266
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,430
wrapped inside a pack of bills of a pickpocket...

267
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,930
Yeah. The one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei

268
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,830
is probably the killer!

269
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,830
We give out the orders, Jodie.

270
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,230
You may be a FBI agent but this is Japan, you know.

271
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,630
Moreover, you're here on vacation, aren't you?

272
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,530
With you going around giving out orders on your own,

273
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,330
we'll lose face.

274
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,930
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,730
My usual habit took command of me.

276
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,430
But, this site is far from the entrance or exit of the shrine.

277
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,630
Not too much time had passed since the victim was killed.

278
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,230
So by closing off the entrance and exit of the shrine,

279
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,730
I'm sure the perp has been contained.

280
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,930
Right, Conan?

281
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,230
Well, it's true that you did the right thing,

282
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,730
and it helped us out but...

283
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,930
But, is it true?

284
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,130
That this woman who was slugged to death

285
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,130
was who the 3rd investigation division's

286
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,730
been pursuing all these years,

287
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,830
that she's the pickpocket Kurobei?

288
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,830
I think there's no mistake about it.

289
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,230
In the coin purse that she had on her,

290
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,330
there were a lot of black painted 5 yen coins.

291
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,730
It seems that Kurobei actually did leave

292
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,430
three black painted 5 yen coins in the pockets

293
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,430
of those she pickpocketed but...

294
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,130
And?

295
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,230
Is it true that you witnessed Kurobei

296
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,930
being slugged to death, Dr. Agasa?

297
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,730
Yes.

298
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,030
I happened to witness it when I came out here

299
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,130
after using the restroom.

300
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,130
Since this place is in the shade of the tree and dark,

301
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,230
at first I thought that someone was just hammering something.

302
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,130
Did you see the perp's face?

303
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,230
It was mostly all silhouetted.

304
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,630
What I'm sure of is that the perp was wearing a hat,

305
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,230
and also was holding a thin stick about 30cm long.

306
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,730
I see. So, that's the murder weapon.

307
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,330
Any other characteristics of the perp?

308
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,130
Let's see.

309
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,230
Oh, come to think of it, when the perp left,

310
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,930
he was dragging his leg a bit!

311
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,030
So, I called out to ask if he was okay.

312
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,030
Dragging his leg?

313
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,130
And, what about the perp?

314
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,530
He ignored me and left.

315
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,430
By the time I found out that the perp had slugged a woman,

316
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,230
he had already disappeared into the crowd.

317
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
I see.

318
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,330
Inspector.

319
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,230
If the perp wanted to get out of here as fast as possible

320
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,630
and the perp was dragging his leg...

321
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,530
It doesn't seem to be an act

322
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,030
to make it off the suspect's list.

323
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,430
But, with only that to go on, it'll be more than difficult

324
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,130
to figure out who did it from among this crowd of flower viewers...

325
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,130
That's close to impossible to do.

326
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,930
I think you can narrow down the target a bit more.

327
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,530
There was something strange in that lady's wallet too.

328
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,730
Something strange?

329
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,030
A GPS transmitter wrapped inside the bills!

330
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,230
Why would something like that be...

331
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,830
If that pickpocket Kurobei was never caught,

332
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,630
it would be impossible to identify Kurobei

333
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,530
until the 5 yen coins painted black

334
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,030
are put into the pocket of the person who was pickpocketed!

335
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,530
So, by making Kurobei deliberately pickpocket

336
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,030
a wallet with the GPS transmitter inside, the perp,

337
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,330
after locating the whereabouts of Kurobei using a cell phone,

338
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,330
waits for Kurobei to go to a lonely place

339
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,930
then slugs her to death!

340
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,030
Then the one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei's the perp?

341
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,130
But, pickpockets frequently work in groups too.

342
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,830
So it could be that they got into a fight and...

343
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,230
True.

344
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,030
I think Kurobei worked alone.

345
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,030
She herself, shouted, "Pickpocket!"

346
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,430
Huh? Just what do you mean?

347
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,630
It's a trick that most pickpockets use!

348
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,230
When you hear that a pickpocket is around,

349
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,330
most people check their wallets, don't they?

350
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,330
That's how pickpockets figure out where their targets

351
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,530
keep their wallets.

352
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,030
And, if she had an accomplice,

353
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,530
she'd make the accomplice do that part, right?

354
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,030
That's why I think she also took your wallet, Jodie.

355
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,230
Oh! My wallet's gone!

356
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,630
She probably took it when you helped her up!

357
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,930
But with the pickpocket dead...

358
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,130
How on earth do we go about looking for the victims

359
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,030
who were pickpocketed?

360
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,430
As to that, I think that soon...

361
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,330
Conan, we found it!

362
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,330
Inside the trash can that was on the side of

363
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,830
where the oracles are tied!

364
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,330
I also found one!

365
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,230
Inside the trash can near the place I drank the water!

366
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,130
Oh! Found another one!

367
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,230
Inside the trash can of the place where the bell is rung!

368
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,930
The shrine owner is taking it for me now!

369
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,730
Here, it was inside the trash can a bit ahead

370
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,830
of the toilet that was the crime scene.

371
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,730
They were about to collect the trash,

372
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,130
but I asked them to let me search the trash first.

373
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,330
Okay, then bring the wallets you found

374
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,430
without putting your fingerprints on them!

375
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,630
-Okay! -Copy.

376
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,630
Right, the wallets!

377
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,430
Pickpockets remove only the money

378
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,230
and dispose of the wallets,

379
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,130
so if we search the contents of the wallets...

380
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,930
We could maybe find the owners of the wallets.

381
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,330
Yes!

382
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,730
Are these four wallets all that you found in the trash cans?

383
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,630
Yes, because the workers said they started

384
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,130
collecting trash from the trash can

385
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,930
that I was searching.

386
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,930
Oh, that blue wallet is mine!

387
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,530
Then, you're one of the suspects too.

388
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,530
What?

389
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,730
No, Jodie's not!

390
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,730
She was with us right through

391
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,030
after she bumped into that lady!

392
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,830
She had no time to kill anybody!

393
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,630
Oh, is that so?

394
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,830
If so, the killer

395
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,330
is highly likely to be one of the owners

396
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,930
of the three wallets that are left.

397
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,430
Oh! Maybe the owner of this wallet can be found right away

398
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,830
since there's a driver's license inside.

399
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,030
Yeah! I saw this man a while ago.

400
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,930
-Huh? -He's the one

401
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,830
who came to talk to Jodie!

402
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,630
He said he had a cold and was wearing a mask!

403
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,630
I see.

404
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,330
It seems that the only wallet with a driver's license inside

405
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,430
is just this black wallet though.

406
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,630
A photo?

407
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,530
I know her too!

408
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,530
What?

409
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,430
She taught us how to ring the bell!

410
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,230
I think she's still around some place.

411
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,130
In the last red wallet, the only thing inside

412
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,130
is an oracle that says "little lucky".

413
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,130
I guess the owner of this wallet won't be found.

414
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,830
I think it's that old man's wallet.

415
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,530
He said that lucky oracles should be taken home.

416
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,430
Yes. Besides, I saw!

417
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,530
He was in front of us

418
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,630
and took money out from that red wallet

419
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,230
to buy the oracle!

420
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,830
Oh! I saw it too!

421
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,230
We thought it was a wallet

422
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,830
that didn't match an old man like him!

423
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,830
Do you know what he looks like?

424
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,730
-Yep! -We'll go look for him then!

425
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,230
Please wait for us to come back!

426
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,230
Hey, all of you!

427
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,630
The person may be a murderer, you know!

428
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,230
Officer Takagi, you go with the children!

429
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,030
Yes, sir!

430
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,730
If one of the three has a stick about 30cm,

431
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,230
then we got the perp.

432
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,930
I think you'll be able to tell right away

433
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,430
even if the perp doesn't have it!

434
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,730
Just what do you mean, Conan?

435
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,030
Because the perp left 3 painted black 5 yen coins

436
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,530
near the corpse, as if to say, I'm paying you back!

437
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,930
Huh?

438
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,430
5 yen coins that are so unique

439
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,530
are not that easy to prepare, are they?

440
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,030
I get it!

441
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,930
So, the person that doesn't have the black 5 yen coins

442
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,930
that Kurobei would've put into his pocket is the perp!

443
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,030
Right!
