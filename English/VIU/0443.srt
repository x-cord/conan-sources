1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,774
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,674
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:05,974
The Youth Detective Squad goes clam digging.

4
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:08,974
The "younger brother" (Yokomizo) makes his appearance!

5
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,274
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:11,874
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,075
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,786
Not yet?

9
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,286
Just a little bit more.

10
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,086
That's why we should've left the house earlier!

11
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:10,287
It can't be helped because the roads were jammed with traffic.

12
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:49,587
We did it!

13
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,586
Finished!

14
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,986
How about it, Doc? Don't you think it's really something?

15
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,486
Wow!

16
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:58,386
What a magnificent sand castle!

17
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,686
Yes! I think we did a good job.

18
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,886
I worked on it too!

19
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:06,886
Although I didn't do much, I helped too!

20
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:11,586
I see. You all cooperated.

21
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,986
Hey, you guys.

22
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:16,786
I thought we came here to dig clams?

23
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,187
Come on, you guys!

24
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:19,987
But...

25
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:22,986
To be honest, I'm bored!

26
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:26,187
No matter how much I dig, all I get is sand, sand, sand!

27
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,386
Well, no big deal.

28
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,586
No need to get desperate looking for clams here

29
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,086
because there doesn't seem to be many here.

30
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,786
Oh?

31
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,687
I don't think so.

32
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,686
Wow! There are so many clams!

33
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,086
A lot.

34
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,186
There are at least 20 to 30 of them.

35
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,186
I hope you didn't go buy them at the fish shop.

36
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:54,786
There are a lot of guys like you around.

37
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:56,286
Idiot!

38
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,786
Why would I do something like that?

39
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,286
You need technique, a knack for digging them!

40
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,586
A knack for it?

41
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:04,186
Tell me how, then.

42
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:09,786
Listen, scrape the water's edge with the rake and make the sand soft.

43
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,987
Then, after a while when the waves come...

44
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:18,886
See?

45
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:21,487
Clams that are lighter than sand come floating.

46
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:23,886
Wow!

47
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,286
You're pretty good, Conan!

48
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,986
Where did you learn something like that?

49
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:29,286
It's like magic!

50
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:32,686
Which means that you can find clams only at the water's edge?

51
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,386
No, that's not it.

52
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:36,586
When clams stick out their siphons,

53
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:40,086
the clams make little holes called "eye of the clam".

54
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:42,887
Moreover, clams are most times huddled together, so...

55
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:46,386
Where there are a lot of those holes...

56
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,886
If you dig gently about 10 to 15cm below

57
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,387
without hurting the shell of the clams...

58
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:54,786
See?

59
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,887
There are quite a lot of them!

60
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:05,487
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 1)"

61
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,986
See? Huh?

62
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:11,986
Where'd they...

63
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,686
If you're wondering where they are...

64
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:15,587
They're over there.

65
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:20,486
Wow, super! They're coming out one after the other!

66
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,986
Talk about great catch! Genta!

67
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,986
I found the "eye of the clam"!

68
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:29,587
If we had a bigger rake, we could probably pick enough to sell.

69
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,386
We could open a fish shop!

70
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:37,686
We could make big cash! Good idea!

71
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:38,687
Yes!

72
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,386
No!

73
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:44,086
It's manners to use a rake that is within 15cm in width

74
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:49,086
and only up to about 2kg per person.

75
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,987
I mean they're short-necked clams, so it's better to be "short"!

76
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,786
But, is everybody following the rule?

77
00:05:56,787 --> 00:06:00,786
The important thing is that each one of us keep that in mind!

78
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,186
Do you understand?

79
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:05,486
Genta, you wouldn't like it either if too many eels are caught

80
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,887
and wouldn't be able to eat eels over rice anymore, would you?

81
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:13,686
That would be a problem!

82
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,986
I don't ever want that to happen!

83
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,487
Genta.

84
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:21,986
See, nobody else is in a rush to take a whole lot for himself, right?

85
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,786
The real purpose of clam digging

86
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:28,186
is to enjoy looking for the shells that are buried under the sand.

87
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,386
I see!

88
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:32,387
Yes! I understand, yes!

89
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:38,586
It seems that there are people who aren't enjoying themselves here too.

90
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:39,886
See.

91
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:42,686
I'll bet he can't find any clams.

92
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,286
Should we tell him how to look for clams?

93
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:46,686
Yeah!

94
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,687
Hey, hey!

95
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:50,086
Do you know about the "eye of the clam"?

96
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,386
Yeah.

97
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,586
If you dig below that hole...

98
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:56,186
There'll be a lot of clams.

99
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,886
"Tsuguo Ushigome (21)" -I dug up a lot of clams already.

100
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:00,187
"College Student" -See.

101
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,686
Then what are you sighing for?

102
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,786
Why, why?

103
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:12,587
I've got a lot of things on my mind.

104
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,386
Hey, Ushigome!

105
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,186
We bought lunches.

106
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,687
And snacks too!

107
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,786
Who're these kids?

108
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,086
Do you know them?

109
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,386
I just happened to meet them now.

110
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:29,386
Who're you guys?

111
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,586
We're...

112
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,486
Members of the same university circle, called...

113
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,786
Aiko-kai!

114
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:39,486
So, what are you all devotees of?

115
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,487
All four of you are wearing matching parkers.

116
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:46,787
Are you guys planning to be comedians?

117
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:52,186
No, it's written on the back of the parker, isn't it?

118
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:53,886
"Clam Devotees Club!"

119
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,586
Clam Devotees Club?

120
00:07:56,587 --> 00:08:00,186
In others words, we love to dig for and eat clams.

121
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:01,786
All four of us!

122
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,086
Well, this parker was made only today,

123
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,586
and this is the first time we're wearing it!

124
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,686
I see, the name of their club

125
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,987
uses a play on words with the word clam.

126
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:15,386
Well, let's start eating, Ushigome!

127
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:18,087
Yeah, let's do that.

128
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,586
See!

129
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:26,887
I bought your favorite, Ushigome.

130
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:30,786
Hey, Ushigome!

131
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:31,887
Huh?

132
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,087
Green tea!

133
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,887
Here!

134
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,686
Oh, thanks.

135
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,987
Well...

136
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,187
This one?

137
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,687
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

138
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,687
Thank you!

139
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:53,087
And...

140
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,986
Potato chips as a snack.

141
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,386
Here you go!

142
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,786
Oh, thank you, thank you!

143
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,586
And? How're you doing digging clams?

144
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,286
Oh, I got quite a lot!

145
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,286
Wow, fantastic!

146
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,287
Let me see.

147
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,387
Just as expected of you, Ushigome!

148
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,187
I'm getting kind of hungry.

149
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,686
Here he goes again!

150
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:21,786
We already ate a while ago, Genta.

151
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:23,987
Let's go to the convenience store then.

152
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,386
Shall we go get some snacks?

153
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:31,287
Yes! I'll go buy some then!

154
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:32,986
Mitsuhiko,

155
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:35,686
I'll bet you're planning to buy Yaiba chocolate in secret.

156
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,186
Come on, Genta...

157
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,286
I'll go too!

158
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,487
Here.

159
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,286
Then, why don't all three of you go together?

160
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:49,386
Don't buy too many things you don't need now!

161
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,587
Okay?

162
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:55,986
And, be careful of cars!

163
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:57,386
Okay!

164
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:01,086
There seems to have been a hit-and-run accident near here the other day.

165
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,887
So, be really careful!

166
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,486
Okay!

167
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,087
Yes, sir!

168
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,687
I wonder if they'll be okay.

169
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:15,786
Shall we start heading home?

170
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,686
I guess so.

171
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,986
We got a lot of clams too.

172
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,786
Let's have a clam party and Ushigome's house!

173
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,286
Okay then, Ushigome.

174
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,786
We'll clean this place up

175
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:30,586
so will you load the clams and make them spit out the sand?

176
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,087
Hey, Ushigome?

177
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:36,786
Oh, that's right!

178
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,486
I found this restaurant that serves good clam dishes the other day.

179
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,486
So why don't we all go there?

180
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:43,886
Oh, sounds great!

181
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,086
Let's go! Let's go!

182
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,286
Then let's have a drink at that restaurant tonight.

183
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,586
And spend the night at Ushigome's house.

184
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:53,286
We can put the clams that we got today in miso soup,

185
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,586
for breakfast tomorrow.

186
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,587
Right? What do you think?

187
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:58,887
Ushigome?

188
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,787
Ushigome?

189
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:06,886
Yeah.

190
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,687
Let's do that.

191
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:27,486
Is something wrong with him?

192
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,987
He seems a little depressed.

193
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,286
-Not really. -It's nothing much.

194
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,986
Clean up time, clean up time.

195
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,087
Right.

196
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,687
So...

197
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,486
Make sure you separate the trash.

198
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,487
Yes, yes.

199
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,487
This bag is for the plastic bottles.

200
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:50,287
Say...

201
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,287
Yes?

202
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,487
Just a while ago...

203
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,886
There seemed to be a change in atmosphere.

204
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,087
Yeah.

205
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,587
Yaiba chocolates.

206
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:07,287
Yaiba gummies.

207
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,187
And, Yaiba snacks!

208
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:13,686
What's this?

209
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:17,186
They're all snacks that involve freebies for Masked Yaiba.

210
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,586
So what?

211
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,986
Genta insisted, so...

212
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:23,586
No fair, Mitsuhiko!

213
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,886
But, they're all good.

214
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,686
By the way, the four people who were here a while ago...

215
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:29,786
did they go home?

216
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:32,286
Yeah. Just a while ago.

217
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:36,086
They cleaned up all their trash nicely and left.

218
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,886
They're pretty well-mannered for young people nowadays!

219
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,086
No.

220
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,587
It seems they forgot something important.

221
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:49,986
-The rake? -But, how do you know it's theirs?

222
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,786
There is no name on it.

223
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:57,586
See, there's a brand new blackish stain on the wooden handle.

224
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,286
This is probably a bloodstain.

225
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,487
Blood?

226
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,486
I see.

227
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:04,686
The man that sighed.

228
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:08,586
When we first met him, he had his index finger in his mouth.

229
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,086
He may have cut his finger

230
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,586
when he was trying to dig out a clam or something.

231
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,086
You want to say that the handle of the rake go stained then, right?

232
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,986
Well, sort of.

233
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,186
Then, they could be looking for it now.

234
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:23,486
Hey, Doc! When did the four leave?

235
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,386
Like I said, just a while ago!

236
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,786
They might still be at the parking lot then!

237
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,486
Let's take it to them then!

238
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,986
Yeah.

239
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,686
Let's all go.

240
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,886
Yeah!

241
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,487
Give it to me, Conan!

242
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:41,186
Hey! It may have been just a while ago, but it was 4 or 5 minutes ago.

243
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,486
I'm sure they already left!

244
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,886
The parking lot is huge.

245
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:47,286
I'm sure they're still here!

246
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:50,087
Where are they? Where?

247
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:53,786
There they are!

248
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:54,986
There!

249
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,986
You forgot something.

250
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,687
Hey!

251
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,458
Clam digging?

252
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,358
Which means that...

253
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:33,658
After finishing digging clams,

254
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,558
while you three were cleaning up the trash, he...

255
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,558
Mr. Ushigome, came back to the car before all of you

256
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,658
with the buckets of clams that you took.

257
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,859
And when you all came back to the car, you found him like this.

258
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,758
Yes, that's right.

259
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,858
The mouth of the victim smells of almond

260
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,858
and judging from this bottle of green tea

261
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,259
that was found on the ground beside him...

262
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,058
It seems that Mr. Ushigome died of poisoning by cyanic acid

263
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,258
that was mixed into his green tea.

264
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,658
Which means...

265
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,858
Just as I thought...

266
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,258
Is it suicide?

267
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,258
Oh! What do you mean by just as I thought?

268
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,958
Do you have something in mind?

269
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,858
It's not that.

270
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,158
He seems to have been troubled over something lately.

271
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,758
He wasn't all that cheerful.

272
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,758
I don't know what he was troubled over though.

273
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,358
Shoko, do you have any idea?

274
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,158
No, I don't.

275
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,858
But, judging from the way he was acting...

276
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:39,158
Suicide is possible.

277
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,758
I guess so.

278
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,858
Or taking advantage of Mr. Ushigome acting as he was,

279
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,258
someone poisoned his green tea.

280
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,558
Someone among you inserted poison.

281
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,459
It's one or the other!

282
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,658
What are you insinuating?

283
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,358
We didn't do such a thing.

284
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,658
And?

285
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,558
Who's the one that bought this tea?

286
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,058
All three of us bought it at the convenience store.

287
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,358
He said that he hadn't eaten anything for breakfast so...

288
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,458
We bought rice balls and snacks along with it too.

289
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,658
Then, did Mr. Ushigome take the green tea out of the plastic bag himself?

290
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,458
-No. -Huh?

291
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,858
I handed it over to him.

292
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:25,358
But, he looked just fine for a while and was gulping down the tea.

293
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,758
What about that?

294
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,858
Did anybody touch the PET bottle while he was drinking from it?

295
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,258
The only time we touched it is when we bought it.

296
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,958
Ushigome had it with him right through.

297
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,958
I don't think anybody touched it.

298
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,058
All I did was throw the rice balls at him and give it to him.

299
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,759
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

300
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,658
Thank you!

301
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,058
I opened a bag of potato chips and put it near him.

302
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,958
But, didn't touch the green tea even once.

303
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,358
Here! For you!

304
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,858
Oh, thanks!

305
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:02,058
But somebody could've done something in a really short span of time.

306
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,458
Oh, no.

307
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,458
They're telling the truth!

308
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,458
I was watching all the time.

309
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,958
After Mr. Ushigome opened the bottle,

310
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,359
nobody besides Mr. Ushigome touched it!

311
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,958
Brat. You're the one that's with Smokey Kogoro all the time.

312
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,359
Smokey? It's Sleeping!

313
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,558
Then, don't tell me that the detective with the flimsy mustache

314
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,258
is also here?

315
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,259
-Where is he? -He's not here!

316
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,658
Really?

317
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:37,358
But, my friends are here with me today!

318
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,158
Conan!

319
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,759
I brought Doc!

320
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,558
Please tell him too, Doc,

321
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,258
that Mr. Ushigome was holding his bottle of green tea all the while.

322
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,659
Oh, okay.

323
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:59,158
He didn't give the bottle of tea to anyone while he was drinking it.

324
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,758
Are you sure you were watching closely?

325
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,058
I'm sure.

326
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,758
I met him together with the children

327
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,158
for the first time today at the beach.

328
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,658
But, since he was sighing all the while, I was a bit worried.

329
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,058
Sighing?

330
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,958
Inspector!

331
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:19,659
This bottle was found by the feet of the body!

332
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,958
Is that so?

333
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,459
Let me see.

334
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:31,458
Not pills but powder seems to have been inside.

335
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,058
There seems have cyanic poisoning in the bottle.

336
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,059
That's...

337
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,358
That bottle is what Ushigome used to put supplement capsules inside.

338
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,958
I hope you're telling the truth.

339
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,458
No mistake about it.

340
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,758
I used to see him use it all the time.

341
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,058
I see.

342
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,858
-Forensic officer! -Yes, sir!

343
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,058
Please check this bottle together with the PET bottle and the cap!

344
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,758
Yes, sir!

345
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,658
Then, I'm counting on you.

346
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,258
But at that time...

347
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,858
What is it, brats?

348
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,958
Did you recall something that bothers you?

349
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,258
Oh, no. It's just...

350
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:08,359
Will you try smiling a bit?

351
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,458
What did you just say?

352
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,758
Because you look so much like him.

353
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,358
The coral headed police officer that we know!

354
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,658
Hi!

355
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,459
Hope you're all well!

356
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,958
Of course they look alike!

357
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,459
He's Officer Yokomizo's younger brother.

358
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,258
For real?

359
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:34,558
Come to think of it, my older brother told me that.

360
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,558
The boy staying with Smokey Kogoro.

361
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,058
It's Sleeping.

362
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,558
The one wearing glasses...

363
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,058
One wearing glasses?

364
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,558
...is hanging around some kids who think they're detectives!

365
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,258
What? We don't think!

366
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,358
We are the Youth Detective Squad!

367
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,858
Right!

368
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,258
His face and voice resemble his brother

369
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,358
but the way he talks and his personality

370
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,358
seems to be the opposite of his brother's.

371
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,658
Yeah. It seems so.

372
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:01,758
Unfortunately, I guess you, the Detective Squad's

373
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,458
not needed for this case.

374
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,758
Huh?

375
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,058
What do you mean?

376
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,358
The situation is, that no one has touched the PET bottle,

377
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,158
and a container which seems to have had poison in it

378
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,958
was found in the car.

379
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:17,758
Moreover, the victim was troubled enough to let out a sigh.

380
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,859
So, this is undoubtedly suicide!

381
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,658
So, go! You kids go on home!

382
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:27,058
You're getting in the way!

383
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,858
What's the big deal, younger brother of Yokomizo?

384
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,658
Let's not get stingy!

385
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:34,258
Is this cap really the cap for that PET bottle?

386
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,558
Yeah.

387
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,058
This was the only cap found in the car.

388
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,959
Moreover, the tea on the inside of the cap is not dried yet.

389
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,958
And the brand is a match.

390
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,758
But, isn't that strange?

391
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,758
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

392
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,159
but there's nothing on the cap.

393
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,658
True.

394
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,058
What? Hey, hey, how come there was blood on it?

395
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,458
I wonder.

396
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,558
Oh, that's probably because...

397
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,558
Ushigome...

398
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,958
Ushigome hurt his finger.

399
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,258
Hurt?

400
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:11,058
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

401
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,858
when he was digging clams.

402
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,358
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

403
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,458
It's probably true that he was hurt.

404
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:23,658
When we first met him, Mr. Ushigome had his finger in his mouth.

405
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,058
That's how we figured out the blood-stained rake

406
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,058
that was left behind on the beach belonged to that chubby mister.

407
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,358
And, came to return it to him.

408
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,059
And, ended up seeing this!

409
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:41,459
I see.

410
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,658
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

411
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,558
Although the blood looks dry.

412
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,458
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

413
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:55,158
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

414
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,558
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

415
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,558
he noticed the blood on it

416
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,959
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

417
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,358
But would a person who is about to commit suicide do such a thing?

418
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,358
I think he wanted to leave without leaving any bad traces behind.

419
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,758
He might want to die nice and clean.

420
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,958
At any rate, let's wait from results from the forensic officer.

421
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,358
Until then, I'll have to have you all wait.

422
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,858
Yeah, okay.

423
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,258
I guess we have no choice.

424
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,359
Yeah.

425
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:01,158
This is suicide, suicide!

426
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,358
It bothers me.

427
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,459
The remark that the person made.

428
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,259
I wonder if it's really suicide.

429
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,158
I admire your deduction is what I'd like to say to you but...

430
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,658
Just when and how could somebody have inserted the poison?

431
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:19,358
This will bring everything to light.

432
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,259
And, just who made the one who did it do it!

433
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:24,158
Next Conan,

434
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,159
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 2)"

435
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,758
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,958
"The cap of the PET bottle."

437
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,158
Say "clam digging-sigh" three times.

438
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,159
Clam dig in sigh.
