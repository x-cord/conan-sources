1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:02,852
Invited over by Masumi Sera,

2
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:05,052
Ran, Sonoko and I go to visit the hotel

3
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,152
that she is staying at.

4
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:10,252
We decided to go have fun at the pool,

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,152
but Nagami Oiso, the daughter of the owner of the hotel,

6
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:15,352
loses her necklace

7
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:18,453
and tells all the other guests to get out of the pool.

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,352
After finishing lunch, we go back to the pool

9
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:25,253
and find that Nagami's whereabouts have become unknown.

10
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:28,252
Then...

11
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,253
Hey, look!

12
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:33,452
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

13
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,952
What?

14
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,852
Isn't... isn't that

15
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:37,953
a person?

16
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,652
Lady...

17
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:48,953
Nagami?

18
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:53,152
But Ms. Nagami mentioned, didn't she?

19
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,752
That Mr. Samaki, her fiance,

20
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:58,153
had something going with you, her younger sister.

21
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:01,452
She also said that the manager offered them

22
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:03,552
to use the hotel room for their rendezvous.

23
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,952
You've got me wrong.

24
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:07,053
Nagami just over thought things.

25
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:11,952
The thing is her birthday was coming up.

26
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,952
We were discussing celebrating her birthday

27
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:18,352
in the suite room of this hotel that she favored.

28
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,352
We talked of the decorations and food.

29
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:23,752
Of course, it was to be a surprise party,

30
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:26,652
so it was kept a secret from Lady Nagami.

31
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,052
We were discussing this in that room,

32
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:33,052
so Nagami probably misunderstood.

33
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,252
Well, Lady Nagami really liked that room,

34
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:40,153
so it's no surprise that she would get upset.

35
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:42,452
She liked it that much?

36
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:43,453
Yes.

37
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:46,052
I hear she kicked a guest who had reservation out of the room

38
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:48,052
in order to spend a night there.

39
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:52,752
So, we have no motive to want to kill her!

40
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:55,452
We were trying to celebrate her birthday!

41
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:59,252
If you still suspect us, you can ask the other staff of the hotel.

42
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:03,253
We talked of the decorations and other stuff with the staff, too.

43
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:07,652
We'll be confirming that later.

44
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:10,752
First of all, we'd like you to tell us

45
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,853
what you've been doing after Ms. Nagami started searching alone.

46
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,252
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard

47
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:24,852
and move forward full speed without slowing down.

48
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,752
The queer testimony of the pool homicide.

49
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,652
The truth comes afloat.

50
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,252
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:32,052
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,153
His name is Detective Conan!

53
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:18,713
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 2)"

54
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,643
"Reception" -Yes.

55
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,343
After we were told to close the pool off,

56
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,743
we've only let authorized personnel through.

57
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:33,443
We let the manager, Lady Hamaka and the secretary, Mr. Samaki,

58
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,743
plus the two bellboys through.

59
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:41,843
Before Lady Nagami became alone, we let them in, too.

60
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:44,643
We forgot something, you see.

61
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:47,643
Well, we just came to check things out.

62
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:52,143
Who was the first to come back here after Ms. Nagami told you all to leave

63
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,143
so that she could do the search alone?

64
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,244
I think it was...

65
00:04:57,744 --> 00:04:59,643
Manager Toyoshima.

66
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:03,143
He said he came back to check on how Lady Nagami was doing.

67
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,343
Do you know what time it was?

68
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,743
I think it was after 12:00.

69
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,744
Just about that time, she received an incoming text mail, you see.

70
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,643
Oh, right. Let's me check.

71
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,543
It was 12:05.

72
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:18,543
What was she doing, then?

73
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:22,043
She was in the water searching.

74
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:25,344
So much so, that she didn't realize that I was there for a while.

75
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:28,343
But when she noticed me there,

76
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,543
she scolded me saying I wasn't called for,

77
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,843
so I left immediately.

78
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,543
I see.

79
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,343
Then, how about after the manager left?

80
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:38,443
Well...

81
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,143
The person who came next was...

82
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:41,144
Oh, right.

83
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:42,644
It was Mr. Samaki.

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,443
Since she was taking quite a while.

85
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:51,444
I went wanting to tell her to leave the search up to someone else,

86
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:56,444
but she wasn't at the poolside, nor in the pool.

87
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,443
I thought maybe she had gone to the ladies room,

88
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,043
so I waited at the poolside,

89
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,143
but It didn't seem like she would be coming back,

90
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,243
so I left.

91
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:08,943
Do you know what time you left?

92
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,443
Not really.

93
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,743
Neither do we.

94
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:15,043
We don't take notes of everything.

95
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:18,043
Oh, but Lady Hamaka came in right after Mr. Samaki left,

96
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,343
and if it's the time she left,

97
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:22,643
it was 12:54.

98
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:26,543
I know because she asked me what time it was when she left.

99
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,243
Why did you ask for the time?

100
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:32,643
We made reservations to have lunch at the hotel at 13:00.

101
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:34,443
That's why Mr. Samaki

102
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:38,443
asked me to go check the ladies room and the changing room.

103
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:41,343
But couldn't find her anywhere.

104
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:45,243
Nor was she at the pool, so I panicked.

105
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:48,343
And couldn't believe the time that was displayed on my cell phone.

106
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,743
So, I impulsively asked for the time.

107
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,843
By the way, where is the ladies room and the changing room?

108
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:54,844
This way.

109
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,243
Between this reception desk and the pool

110
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,343
there are the changing room and the shower room

111
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,044
and beyond it, is the ladies room.

112
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:07,043
Using it seems more than enough a place to hide the corpse.

113
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,143
Yes.

114
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:12,243
This corridor is also a blind spot from the two receptionists.

115
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:15,243
And what happened after that?

116
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:18,243
We called the manager and Mr. Samaki.

117
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,243
And also the bellboys...

118
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,343
and they split up to look for her.

119
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,743
Where was Nagami then?

120
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,743
She wasn't there. Not inside the pool either.

121
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,843
I went to look for her in the locker room of the shower too.

122
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:34,143
Of course, I looked in the men's room, too.

123
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,043
I shouted out to her.

124
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,043
We searched for about an hour but couldn't find her,

125
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:42,043
so we asked the receptionists

126
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,843
if they really didn't see her leave.

127
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,443
That's when they came.

128
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,243
So we was explaining what happened.

129
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:53,543
When these bellboys found her sunk in the pool.

130
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:55,343
I see.

131
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:56,543
But...

132
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,243
why did you go back to the pool to look for her?

133
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:02,343
When you all searched for her, she wasn't there, right?

134
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:05,543
That's because I had this bad feeling.

135
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:10,143
I thought I heard a strange sound from the direction of the pool.

136
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,944
Like the sound of a large bubble coming out.

137
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:28,343
I thought so. The opening of the drain is fixed on with a screw.

138
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:30,243
Look, Conan.

139
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:34,843
Something that looks like a hook is screwed on above the drain.

140
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:38,344
Moreover, it's right in the middle of side of the pool, too.

141
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,443
Hey! What're you guys doing?

142
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,443
No doubt about it.

143
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:45,744
That person's the perp.

144
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,643
Okay, so let me get it together.

145
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,143
The victim, Ms. Nagami Oiso, says

146
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:56,743
she'll look for the necklace she lost, alone.

147
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,343
Then, after she gets all of you to leave the pool.

148
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:04,143
At around 12:05 noon, the manager of the hotel,

149
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,643
Mr. Toyoshima comes to check on her.

150
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,843
But was sent back saying, he's not called for.

151
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,943
Next, when secretary, Mr. Samaki comes,

152
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,644
Ms. Nagami was nowhere in sight.

153
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,643
As Mr. Samaki was leaving, he asks Ms. Hamaka who comes,

154
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:23,343
to check the changing room and the ladies room,

155
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,843
but it was confirmed that she wasn't there either...

156
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:28,543
at 12:54 noon.

157
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:33,743
After that, the manager, Mr. Samaki and Ms. Hamaka,

158
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:35,943
go to search for her along with the two bellboys,

159
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,543
but couldn't find her.

160
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,543
Ten minutes after finish searching for her,

161
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,443
the two bellboys return to the pool

162
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,643
and find Ms. Nagami

163
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,243
who is sunk in the middle of the pool.

164
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:50,743
Are the time and chain of events correct?

165
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:53,343
-Yes. -I think so.

166
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,743
Ms. Nagami's ETD

167
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,743
is between 12:00 noon and 13:00.

168
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,843
Only you three went in and out of the pool

169
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:03,443
during this time.

170
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:07,743
Therefore, it is highly likely that the perp is one of you.

171
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:11,543
If the corpse was sunk at the bottom of the pool the whole time,

172
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,343
somebody would've found it,

173
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,843
when you split up to look for her together.

174
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,743
However, it is unthinkable that the corpse

175
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,543
was sunk to the bottom of the pool

176
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,843
without anyone noticing.

177
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:27,343
Much less, in the middle of the pool.

178
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,843
This is indeed an impossible crime.

179
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:31,343
Right, Takagi?

180
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,244
Don't you think so, too?

181
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,743
Officer Takagi?

182
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:41,343
After whispering something with Conan and Ms. Sera,

183
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:43,543
Officer Takagi headed over to the pool.

184
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:44,544
What?

185
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,543
He was carrying a large aquarium along

186
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,743
while you were in the men's room, Inspector.

187
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,843
He said he was going to use it to do an experiment.

188
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:54,544
Gosh, what is he doing?

189
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,643
I tell you it's Little Sera, not Miss Sera.

190
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:00,243
Oh, yeah.

191
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,743
Oh, and he also said

192
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,043
that he'd like you all to come watch the experiment.

193
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,344
It seems he can disclose who the perp is by doing so.

194
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,345
Hey!

195
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,046
Officer Takagi!

196
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,245
He's not...

197
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,145
anywhere.

198
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:27,645
Besides, why has the pool been filled with water again?

199
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,445
Since we finished investigating,

200
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:32,345
we decided to try out the experiment that Officer Takagi told us about.

201
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:35,145
I'm asking, what are you going to experiment?

202
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,546
Oh, well...

203
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,645
Don't disclose the secret beforehand.

204
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,045
I don't understand what's going on.

205
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,045
Hey, Officer Takagi!

206
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,845
Come out and explain this to me!

207
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,145
Hey!

208
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,045
Takagi?

209
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,246
Gosh.

210
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,945
Where'd he go anyway?

211
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,746
Officer Takagi's here...

212
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:59,245
in the pool.

213
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,646
What?

214
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:05,045
He's not there.

215
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,645
Where is he?

216
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:08,545
Can you see him, Conan?

217
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,846
I can't see him now either, though.

218
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:16,246
But if I cut this fishing line that's on this hook...

219
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,346
Aquarium?

220
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,845
-Officer Takagi? -Takagi?

221
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:29,245
Oh, couldn't you see me?

222
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,745
No.

223
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:32,045
But why?

224
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,746
Because of the total reflection of light.

225
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,145
Water and air are both transparent,

226
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:41,045
but the refractive index is different.

227
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,245
When light passes through water with a high refractive index

228
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:46,645
to low refractive index air,

229
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,945
if you look at the boundary of the water and air

230
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:51,245
from an angle directly in front,

231
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:54,945
all the light is reflected like a mirror,

232
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:58,546
and the object on the opposite side of the boundary becomes invisible.

233
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,946
Why don't we try it?

234
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:10,845
See. You can see my ten yen coin sunk in the water of the aquarium, right?

235
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,745
Well, yes.

236
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:15,545
But if you turn the cup upside down

237
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,546
and cover the ten yen coin with it with air still in it.

238
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:21,645
It... it disappeared...

239
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,745
Wow, Conan!

240
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,645
It's just a simple science experiment.

241
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:29,345
I think you learned it in grade school, too.

242
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,145
Really?

243
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:35,445
First graders nowadays are taught something so difficult?

244
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:38,045
It's the same as what happened to Officer Takagi.

245
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:41,645
He was in the pool upside down in an aquarium filled with air.

246
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:44,946
That's why he was invisible.

247
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:50,445
But couldn't you see him from directly above?

248
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,545
Yeah.

249
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,845
Because if you view the boundary

250
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:56,345
between the air and water from a low angle,

251
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,545
it doesn't reflect the light like a mirror.

252
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,345
But this is a pool.

253
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,745
So, you can't look at it from directly on top, right?

254
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,745
True.

255
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,045
In other words,

256
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:11,245
after the perp drowned Ms. Nagami who was searching for the necklace alone,

257
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,545
placed an aquarium that was prepared beforehand

258
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:16,445
over the corpse that was in the pool

259
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:20,245
and secured it passing a fishing line through the holes

260
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:23,345
of the frames of the drain on both sides of the pool.

261
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,845
Then all that was left to do was to tilt the aquarium a little,

262
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,845
insert their hand inside

263
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:30,345
to release the air from Ms. Nagami's tank

264
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:33,546
till it filled the aquarium and all done.

265
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,345
Since fishing lines are elastic,

266
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,346
it's possible to at least tilt the aquarium.

267
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:45,745
But how did they drown her?

268
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:47,245
That's easy.

269
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:51,745
They probably said something to her to put her guard down

270
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,545
then grabbed her neck from behind,

271
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:58,046
removed her mouthpiece and held her under.

272
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,945
With the tank and weights, Ms. Nagami sank easily.

273
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:06,845
And underwater no one can hear you scream.

274
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,345
That's how it was, right?

275
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:12,046
Hotel manager, Mr. Ensaku Toyoshima?

276
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:17,146
Did you lower her guard

277
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:20,345
by pointing your toes in the pool

278
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:24,945
and telling her that her necklace was there?

279
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,145
But...

280
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:30,045
is it possible to secure an aquarium using just one fishing line?

281
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,945
The aquarium was filled with air, wasn't it?

282
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:36,345
If you make four dents at the bottom of the aquarium,

283
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:39,145
and hook the fishing lines twice through the dents,

284
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,646
it won't float easily.

285
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:44,245
And if you attach the end of the line

286
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:48,246
to a hook attached near the surface of the pool,

287
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,545
you don't have to go into the water.

288
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:52,345
But just cut the fishing line.

289
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,145
In order to float the aquarium up

290
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:56,945
and make the corpse appear.

291
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,446
Just like Conan did, a while ago.

292
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:04,445
In other words, when Mr. Toyoshima came to check things out,

293
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:08,045
he drowned Ms. Nagami and held her under.

294
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,545
Then hid her corpse from everybody's vision

295
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:12,445
using the trick I just described.

296
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,145
Then, after everyone had finished searching,

297
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,045
on the way back, he severed the fishing line

298
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,145
and made the corpse appear.

299
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,745
But when the aquarium came floating up,

300
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,345
there was quite a loud noise, wasn't there?

301
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:28,145
He shouted to mask the sound,

302
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:31,346
saying, "Where are you, Lady Nagami?"

303
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,745
The others who were looking for Ms. Nagami

304
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,545
were probably shouting, too.

305
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:39,545
So the sound probably was almost completely blotted out.

306
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,445
But that aquarium was cracked, wasn't it?

307
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:46,245
Moreover, not in the middle where she was found in the pool,

308
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:47,745
but near the corner.

309
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:50,245
That's right. When did he move it?

310
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:53,045
The only time he could've moved the aquarium

311
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,945
was when Ms. Nagami's corpse was carried out of the pool.

312
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,245
Back then,

313
00:16:57,246 --> 00:17:00,845
the only thing the manager was carrying was the tank.

314
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,545
He probably put his foot into the aquarium

315
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:07,546
and moved it by dragging it along through the water.

316
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,545
After moving it over to the corner of the pool,

317
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,745
he struck the tank against it and shattered it to pieces.

318
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,645
Everybody else's attention was focused on the girl

319
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:17,945
who was pulled out of the pool besides.

320
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:21,145
Sound is virtually not heard in the water, you see.

321
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:24,145
But the manager stepped on the cracked pieces of glass

322
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,745
and hurt himself, you know?

323
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,145
Would somebody do something like that knowingly?

324
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,945
I think he would.

325
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:33,945
Because nobody would imagine that the person who hurt himself

326
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,745
would do something like that.

327
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:39,145
If the aquarium's going to be discovered by the police anyway,

328
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:42,845
I would figure I may as well shatter it to pieces

329
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,245
so people can't tell what it originally was.

330
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,745
You're a sly brat after all!

331
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,045
God knows what kind of adult you'll turn into.

332
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,545
Oh, well, you see.

333
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:54,045
I just tried putting myself in the perp's shoes.

334
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,345
I mean, is that your point?

335
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:59,345
So do you have any proof?

336
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,645
Yeah, the fishing line.

337
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,545
When he cut the fishing line,

338
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:07,445
he had to quickly reel in the line attached to the drain

339
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,545
on the other side.

340
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,445
I think that the fingerprints of Manager Toyoshima

341
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,945
are on the fishing line.

342
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:18,445
But aren't fishing lines pretty thin?

343
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,345
One by one they are.

344
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:24,346
But I'm sure that when he wound the line he bunched it up,

345
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,345
there are several places where his fingerprints

346
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,845
would be a perfect match.

347
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:32,245
That shouldn't be hard to find, right, forensic officer?

348
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,545
Of course, not.

349
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,945
But...

350
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,845
the manager doesn't have a motive to kill her.

351
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:38,945
He's right.

352
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:44,145
We were just planning to celebrate Nagami's birthday together.

353
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:46,745
I didn't want to celebrate it,

354
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:49,346
especially not in the suite room.

355
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:54,345
I had a younger sister who was much younger than me.

356
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:57,445
I reserved that suite room for her and her husband

357
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,245
because they said that they wanted to experience

358
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,746
staying over there if once in their life.

359
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:05,045
She said that she wanted to celebrate the birthday of her son

360
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,745
who was going to turn three.

361
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,745
That room has a great scenic view

362
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:14,445
and that day you could see the fireworks on display from the veranda, too.

363
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,145
But suddenly on that day,

364
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:20,645
Lady Nagami tells me she wants to watch the fireworks

365
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,945
with her friends from that room.

366
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:27,345
My younger sister and her family ended up having to move to another hotel.

367
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,345
On the way there, they got into a car accident and died,

368
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,645
their son and all.

369
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:34,446
Oh, no.

370
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:38,745
But that's unjustified resentment, isn't it?

371
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,445
Unjustified resentment?

372
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,145
No way.

373
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,945
That day, Lady Nagami

374
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:46,945
didn't spend the night in that room.

375
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:49,745
Do you know why?

376
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:53,545
Because her friend who was headed over to this hotel

377
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,245
caused a traffic accident.

378
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:57,545
Right!

379
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:00,645
That woman was in the car that ran over

380
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,846
my younger sister and her family!

381
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,345
But...

382
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:12,445
how'd you get such information?

383
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,945
That day,

384
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,046
she called me.

385
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,945
She said that the friend's car that she was riding on

386
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,945
got into a traffic accident,

387
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:23,145
but she didn't want to get involved.

388
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:26,545
So to testify that she was in this hotel room

389
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:29,346
from noon right through.

390
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,645
From that day since,

391
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,245
I've been waiting for the chance to take revenge

392
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:39,145
and for that woman to come to this pool.

393
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,745
I gambled on whether I could remove the necklace from her neck,

394
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:45,746
which was to serve as a trigger to committing this murder.

395
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,845
The heavens seem to have stood on my side.

396
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:55,245
But this murder plan that I thought out with care

397
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,745
was exposed by these young detectives.

398
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:02,446
My efforts have indeed been washed away like water bubbles.

399
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:29,845
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:31,845
You came all this way,

401
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,345
but I couldn't offer any hospitality.

402
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:36,745
It couldn't be helped because there was a murder case involved.

403
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:42,745
But you, even back during the "Which sweets is it?" case,

404
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:46,545
you make people appear and disappear out of thin air.

405
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,845
It's as if you're a magician or something.

406
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:50,146
A magician?

407
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:54,346
I'm not the magician.

408
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:00,346
You're a magician, aren't you?

409
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:06,946
You know what...

410
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:11,145
Have you ever met me, Sera?

411
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:13,545
Oh, you just called her Sera!

412
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:14,845
Oh, sorry.

413
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,145
It's okay, you can call me Sera.

414
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,045
See, she says it's fine.

415
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,245
Yes.

416
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:21,545
See you, then.

417
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,546
-Oh, okay. -Bye, bye.

418
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:27,846
So, shall we head on home, too!

419
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,346
That girl...

420
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:38,046
She looks familiar to me, too.

421
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,446
"Next Episode."

422
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:48,646
Yasumi?

423
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:53,145
In other words, it's an accident?

424
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,246
We have nothing to do with it.

425
00:23:58,446 --> 00:23:59,746
So that's the story.

426
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:04,645
The fact is, there is still a continuation to my deduction.

427
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:07,146
There are still some unsolved mysteries, you see.

428
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,445
