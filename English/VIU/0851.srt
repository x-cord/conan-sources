1
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:07,730
Pops invites Ran and I to go Beppu Hot Springs in Oita,

2
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,330
so we all go there.

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,130
Blood Lake Hell and Ogre Mountain Hell.

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,830
Going to Beppu Hot Springs means visiting the hells, right?

5
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:19,230
Visiting the hells, sounds like fun!

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,131
But one thing bothers me.

7
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,130
The very person, Pops who asked to come along with him on the trip,

8
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,230
for some reason, isn't saying a word.

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,430
I'm sorry. Please go ahead.

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,130
Huh? That voice...

11
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:38,430
Thank you.

12
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,831
Not at all.

13
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:44,030
Officer Ta...

14
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:46,430
I'm not here.

15
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:49,131
You can't see me.

16
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,931
What?

17
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,730
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

18
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,930
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

19
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:13,230
Officer Takagi and Pops are behaving strangely.

20
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,430
Fraught with foreboding they head to Kyushu.

21
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,130
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,230
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,631
His name is Detective Conan!

"Beppu Station"

26
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:05,797
Long ago,

27
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,697
the places where hot springs gushed out were called hell

28
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,898
because people feared them and stayed away from them.

"Kamado Jigoku (Stove Hell)" -The Stove Hell

30

is where a red ogre greets you from on top the stove.

31
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,498
The Stove Hell is where a red ogre greets you from on top the stove.

32
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,398
Fantastic!

33
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,198
It's so vast and beautiful.

34
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,898
I can't see a thing!

35
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:46,697
Ocean Hell is said to have been formed

36
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:47,798
by the eruption of Mt. Tsurumidake.

37

The Stone Monk Hell where boiling bubbles of mud come

38
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,098
bubbling up.

39
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,097
Mountain Hell where hippos and flamingos

40
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,698
are being taken care of.

41
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,598
How scary!

42
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:12,797
How cute!

43
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,697
The Ogre Mountain Hell,

44

which is also known as crocodile/alligator hell.

45
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,798
White Lake Hell, where Piranhas from the Amazon can be seen.

46
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:34,798
Watersprout Hell where steam comes gushing out from the ground.

47
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:40,197
The Blood Lake Hell, which emits red steam.

48
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:44,197
Walking through and visiting these eight hells

49
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:46,798
is the centerpiece to touring Beppu.

50
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:50,397
-Here goes! -Okay!

51
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:51,497
Did it come out good?

52
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:53,298
Yep. Do want to look at it?

53
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,198
What's wrong, Conan?

54
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,698
What is it?

55
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,898
He's sure carrying a large bag.

56
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,297
That man...

57
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,898
Huh? Come to think of it, where's Dad?

58
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,097
I guess it's hard to find clues based on this photo alone after all.

59
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:26,597
-Dad! -What?

60
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,997
Just what are you doing, all by yourself?

61
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:32,498
Well... I'm not doing anything in particular.

62
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:35,398
Hot!

63
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:43,397
-Hot, hot! -What's this?

64
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:45,698
Hey, idiot! Give it back to me!

65
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,397
Dad, who is she?

66
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,797
Well, she's...

67
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:58,197
The thing is...

68
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,497
Pops, I think you should tell her the truth.

69
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,297
Huh?

70
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,597
Well, the thing is...

71
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,397
Yesterday, the president of the famous Nakadai Electrics

72
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,697
came to the office, you see.

73
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:11,997
"Mouri Detective Agency"

74
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,897
Your daughter is missing?

75
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:17,097
"Hidetora Nakadai (58)" -Yes, my daughter's name is Manami.

76
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,397
Early this morning, she left a note saying

77
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:22,797
she was going to take a trip alone and disappeared.

78
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,697
You must be worried.

79
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,697
Do you have any idea where she may have gone?

80
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:30,397
Well, I found this picture in her room.

81
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,597
Welcome to hell?

82
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,497
"Yozo Hosogai (40)" -It's a ticket for visiting

83

the hells in Beppu in Oita Prefecture.

84
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,397
Beppu?

85
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,198
The fact is, my daughter just got engaged.

86
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:48,797
"Kenichiro Ehara (35)" -Her marriage partner is

87
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:51,797
the president of an IT company called Mr. Kenichiro Ehara.

88
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:53,597
It seems that the moment the engagement was announced,

89
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,997
that picture was sent to her by a man called Hiroyuki.

90
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,197
Hiroyuki?

91
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,697
It's the man that she had been going with.

92
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:03,697
I didn't know about it,

93
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,397
but according to my secretary Hosogai,

94
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:09,597
she got to know him in Beppu where she went on her graduation trip.

95
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,997
It seems that he's a local Japanese paper craft artisan,

96
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,997
and seems to have been sending her letters several times

97
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:16,598
even after they broke up.

98
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:21,697
I think that maybe he has more intimate private pictures of her

99
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,097
and is blackmailing her for them.

100
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,297
If that's a fact,

101
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:30,097
he's a slimeball!

102
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:35,397
My daughter probably didn't want me or her fiance to find out about it

103
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:38,497
so maybe she went to meet Hiroyuki on her own.

104
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,097
That could be dangerous!

105
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,497
She could get messed up in a case!

106
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:43,697
What?

107
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:47,197
But if we report this to the police, it would be a scandal

108
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,297
and hurt the reputation of the company.

109
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:52,597
Who cares about the reputation of the company!

110
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,697
Not only that, I think it'll hurt Manami as well.

111
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,097
All right!

112
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,098
Please let me, Kogoro Mouri handle your daughter's case!

113
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:06,197
That's the story.

114
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:10,397
That's why I planned a casual family trip out here.

115
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,397
He calls this casual.

116
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,097
If you told us to begin with,

117
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,697
we would've helped you, too.

118
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,897
These Paradise Buns sure are good.

119
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,398
When on earth did you get those?

120
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,197
When we went to Ocean Hell.

121
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:28,297
My goodness.

122
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,498

"Yunotsubo Road"

125
00:08:56,698 --> 00:09:00,297
I can't believe we're openly dating each other like this!

126
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,797
It's like a dream.

127
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:04,497
Officer Takagi.

128
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,197
It's surprising that you got time off.

129
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:07,497
What?

130
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:10,597
You're handling that armed robbery case, aren't you?

131
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:13,298
It still hasn't been solved, has it?

132
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,597
Well, I've been staking out all this time,

133
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:31,897
so Inspector Megure told me to take time off.

134
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,198
Really?

135
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,897
Come this way. There's something I want to show you.

136
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:37,898
What?

137
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:44,997
How beautiful!

138
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:46,497
Isn't it?

139
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:50,797
At the church next door, weddings are held, too.

140
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,298
What?

141
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:55,497
"Yufuin Stained Glass Museum" -Weddings, too?

142
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:56,697
Yes.

143
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,197
All right, she getting interested.

144
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,898
If things work out well...

145
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,997
If I can keep this up,

146
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,598
we can start making memories, just the two of us!

147
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,497
How beautiful!

148
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:34,198
Conan! The view on this side is even better!

149
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:36,997
Since there's nobody else around,

150
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,697
why don't you come over to this side?

151
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:42,597
Idiot, you're there.

152
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,197
Of all things, kid...

153
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:47,597
Why'd you want to stay over at this inn?

154
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:52,198
Because the shuttle bus of this inn was in Manami's photo.

155
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,997
You're really something, Conan,

156
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,997
when even Dad didn't notice it.

157
00:10:57,998 --> 00:10:59,097
Don't be ridiculous!

158
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:02,497
Famed Detective Kogoro Mouri had noticed!

159
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:05,097
What? Really?

160
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,798
Of course.

161
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,097
It seems Dad hired a detective.

162
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:13,497
He's searching for me.

163
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,997
I don't know what you're up to,

164

but it's all over. Please forget it.

Well, that sure was a good bath.

166
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,497
It was a really big outdoor bath, wasn't it?

167
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:24,897
What?

168
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:26,497
What's the matter?

169
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,597
Didn't that girl that just went by... look a lot like Manami?

170
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:30,998
What?

171
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,597
Are you all right?

172
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:38,897
A red ogre...

173
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,498
Red ogre?

174
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,047
Hold it!

175
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:19,546
What? You found my daughter?

176
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:20,646
Yes.

177
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,346
When we told her you were worried about her,

178
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:26,946
she promised to return home together with us.

179
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,146
Is that right?

180
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,346
I'm worried, so I'll head over to your place instead.

181
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:32,046
President, you've got meetings scheduled

182
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,546
for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

183
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,647
Who cares about the meetings!

184
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,046
I'll take the first train tomorrow and head over there

185
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,846
so please take care of her till then!

186
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,247
All right!

187
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,046
I wonder why.

188
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:56,047
There are no footprints anywhere.

189
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,047
That scratch?

190
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,446
Hiroyuki Hayami?

191
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:06,946
He's my ex-boyfriend.

192
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,746
I used to go with him until 6 months ago.

193
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,946
So that ex-boyfriend of yours sent you this photo?

194
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:17,446
Yes. I just got engaged

195
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:20,046
so I got scared and called Hiroyuki right away.

196
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,346
Then, he told me to come to Beppu immediately.

197
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:27,046
In other words, he tried to blackmail you with the pictures.

198
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,646
That he has photos that are even more intimate

199
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,646
and want you to buy them from him.

200
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,946
More intimate photos?

201
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,846
For instance, photos where...

202
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:37,946
you're both kissing and stuff.

203
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,846
Dad! How rude to ask something like that!

204
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:45,446
Couldn't the ogre that we saw last night have been Hiroyuki?

205
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:46,846
I don't know.

206
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,946
I just wanted to hide what I had with Hiroyuki

207
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:52,946
from my father and fiance as well.

208
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:56,946
Your fiance, Mr. Kenichiro Ehara is the president of a company

209
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:59,046
that makes two billion a year, right?

210
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,546
On top of that, he's a fashion icon, too.

211
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:03,446
Amazing.

212
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,346
Don't you have any pictures of Hiroyuki?

213
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,746
Yes, I do. Although it's from six months ago.

214
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:10,947
Here.

215
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,347
He's not the man who was wearing the sunglasses.

216
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,846
The fog is romantic.

217
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:26,847
Chance!

218
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:30,046
We'll have our wedding at that church.

219
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,346
Ms. Sato!

220
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,046
You see...

221
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,347
What?

222
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:39,846
Yes, this is Sato!

223
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,546
Who can it be at a time like this?

224
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,146
Inspector Megure.

225
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:47,746
What? The car of the armed robber was found?

226
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:51,546
The Umi Tamago Parking lot at the Oita Marine Aquarium, correct?

227
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,746
Oita?

228
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:56,646
What? Officer Takagi isn't at work because of a cold?

229
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,946
I got it! I'll be fine alone!

230
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,946
I'll head over to Oita right away!

231
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:04,346
I'm sorry!

232
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:06,746
I wanted to match my day off with yours, you see.

233
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,146
No making excuses!

234
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,847
I'm sorry!

235
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:12,146
Since you're an officer,

236
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:14,846
you've got to make compensations by doing your job!

237
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,146
Let's go.

238
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,347
Okay.

239
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:38,947
"Oita Station"

240
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,346
I've been waiting for you, president.

241
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:44,746
Thank you, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:47,746
This is Mr. Ehara, Manami's fiance.

243
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,046
I'm Ehara.

244
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:53,446
I've come because I'm also worried about Manami.

245
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,846
Have you told Mr. Ehara about Hiroyuki?

246
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,246
I've told him everything,

247
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,146
but he says he'll take her as is, her past inclusive.

248
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:02,746
I see.

249
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:03,946
And where's Manami?

250
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,546
She's in her room changing clothes

251
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,947
and should be coming soon.

252
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,647
Welcome to hell.

253
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,946
But she sure is late.

254
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,247
I'll go check.

255
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,146
Manami!

256
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,747
I'm opening the door.

257
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:35,847
Dad, come here, quick! Manami's...

258
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,946
Why's the room so messed up like this?

259
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,247
Dad, the emergency door is open!

260
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,246
The traces of the tires are new, aren't they?

261
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,746
Like they were put here just now.

262
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,746
Mr. Mouri, where's Manami?

263
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,746
She could've been kidnapped by someone!

264
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,647
Kidnapped?

265
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:05,946
Hello?

266
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,346
You're President Nakadai, correct?

267
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,746
Who's asking?

268
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,746
I have your daughter, Manami.

269
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:11,846
What?

270
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,046
If you want her back safely,

271
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:16,646
get 100 million yen ready.

272
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,546
100 million?

273
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:21,846
If you contact the police, your daughter is gone.

274
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:26,246
Okay, I'll do as you say so give her safely back to me!

275
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,547
I'll call you again an hour later.

276
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,246
Is the perp Hiroyuki?

277
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:35,347
It's very likely.

278
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,846
Something's not right.

279
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,147
There must be something behind this kidnapping.

280
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:55,446
We're Sato and Takagi from MPD.

281
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,346
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,647
Glad to be of help...

283
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,946
It doesn't look like it was abandoned.

284
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:07,946
The perp may be somewhere nearby.

285
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,447
Nearby.

286
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:16,446
There's a possibility the perp may attack partway.

287
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,146
Please leave transporting the ransom to me.

288
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,546
Ran.

289
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,546
You had a fluorescent ink marker on you, right?

290
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,847
Yes. But why?

291
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:35,047
Hey brat, what're you snooping around for?

292
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,446
This is Nakadai.

293
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,046
Is the money ready?

294
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,146
Yeah.

295
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:43,846
Put the cash in Manami's yellow bag

296
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,346
and come to Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo.

297
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:48,946
Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo?

298
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:52,346
Make Kenichiro Ehara bring the ransom.

299
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,046
You want Ehara to bring it?

300
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,646
Come within 30 minutes.

301
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,146
How does he know my name?

302
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:02,246
If the perp is Hiroyuki,

303
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,146
it's not surprising that he would know your name

304
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:06,946
being that you're Manami's fiance.

305
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:10,146
Don't tell me he's planning to hurt me or something.

306
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,946
Don't worry. I'm with you!

307
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:16,546
Mr. Ehara, Manami's life is at stake.

308
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:19,746
Do as the perp says.

309
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:20,747
Yes, sir.

310
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:24,247
"The Oita Marine Palace Aquarium Umitamago"

311
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:29,246
Welcome to Oita Marine Palace Aquarium Umitamago.

312
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:34,446
Officer Takagi, there's no one who looks like the perp on this side.

313
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,246
Clear here, too.

314
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:39,646
Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo is on the other side of the road,

315
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,546
so I'll try going over there!

316
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,047
"Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo"

317
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,046
It seems there are 1,500 while monkeys here.

318
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:04,547
Really?

319
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,647
It seems to be good luck for monkey's to run under your legs.

320
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,446
Look at the number of monkeys here.

321
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,647
It may be hard to find them here.

322
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:20,247
Hey!

323
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,747
Hold it!

324
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,347
Over here.

325
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:38,746
What is it?

326
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,447
Hey! Give it back to me!

327
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,546
Hey, Takagi!

328
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,847
Mr. Mouri?

329
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,046
We're investigating an abduction.

330
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,546
-Don't get in our way. -What?

331
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,146
We're here investigating an armed robbery, too.

332
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:01,146
An armed robbery?

333
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:03,046
Mr. Mouri!

334
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:06,346
Just as I thought, this is too much of a job for me to take on.

335
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,046
What're you talking about?

336
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,847
Manami's life is at stake.

337
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,447
What shall I do?

338
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,646
Hello?

339
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:21,646
Put the bag on top of the monkey rock.

340
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,146
The monkey rock?

341
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:26,146
The monkey rock

342
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:28,646
is a rock that looks like the profile of a monkey.

343
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,746
It's said that if a couple finds it they'll attain happiness.

344
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,646
That way!

345
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,247
Over there!

346
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,946
Is it okay for us to climb up there?

347
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,746
Shut up! It's no time to be thinking that way!

348
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:46,647
The perp... Where is he coming from?

349
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,247
All we have left to do is to wait for the perp to show up.

350
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,646
Wait!

351
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:09,147
Gosh!

352
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,647
Conan!

"Next Episode"

354
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,146
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

355
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:53,246
Officer Sato, don't move until I get there!

356
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:56,447
I'm arresting you on charges of armed robbery!

357
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,546
Hey, where's the perp's car?

358
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:04,246
No good, I can't see a thing!

359
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,547
Officer Sato, I'll be right there!

360
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,746
Next Conan,
