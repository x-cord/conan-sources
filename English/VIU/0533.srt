1
00:00:01,781 --> 00:00:03,081
The boy that Ms. Kurumi Shodo.

2
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:06,781
"Kurumi Shodo (39)" -befriended at the beach 30 years ago,

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:09,681
saved her life from a traffic accident,

4
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,481
she owed her life to him.

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,181
Kurumi says that the lottery ticket she happened to buy

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,981
was a winning ticket for 1 billion yen

7
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,081
and she wants to give it to the boy who saved her.

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:21,081
So, she contacted TV stations and magazines.

9
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,981
The clues are her memory of the summer days

10
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:26,281
and the large scar that the boy got

11
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,681
when he saved her from the accident.

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,281
Two men appear when she calls out for the boy.

13
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,081
Mr. Ryuhei Kusumoto has a large scar on his back

14
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:36,881
and Mr. Sogo Banba has a scar on his chest.

15
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:40,381
Both scars are large, extending in one straight line.

16
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,081
In order to discern which is the real man

17
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,681
we all go to visit the Shodo residence but,

18
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:50,081
there we find the officers of the First Investigation Division

19
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,481
secretly staking out in pursuit of a killer

20
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,681
whose time is about to expire.

21
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:57,581
That culprit also has a straight lined scar on his body.

22
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,781
However, we also find that

23
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,481
the butler at the Shodo residence,

24
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:05,181
Mr. Taisuke Hoya has a scar on his back.

25
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:09,081
Who on earth is the "boy of her memory"?

26
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,781
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

27
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,281
Saturday nights are for mystery.

28
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,281
With the deadline approaching, a first love comes to light.

29
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,781
The case of the scar takes an unexpected turn!

30
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,381
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,181
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,081
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:09,754
"The Scar that Invokes the Past."

34
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,877
No way.

35
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,877
The butler had a scar on his back too?

36
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:19,677
Yes. Although unlike Mr. Kusumoto and Banba's scar,

37
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:23,377
his scar was smaller that had only about 15 cm.

38
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,977
There's a chance that Hoya the butler,

39
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:29,377
may turn out to be the murderer too.

40
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,377
Why?

41
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,477
Isn't the scar on the murderer a big one too?

42
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:34,977
Well, when the Superintendent slashed

43
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:37,477
the killer and wounded him,

44
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,377
he was dazed out,

45
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,277
so it could be that he doesn't remember

46
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,477
the accurate length of the scar.

47
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,477
Besides, it seems as if that murderer

48
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,377
is very cautious too.

49
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,777
After that killer was slashed by the Superintendent,

50
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,777
he fled by car,

51
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,077
but when the car was found later,

52
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:02,277
no signs of his prints nor blood was detected at all.

53
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,877
The sheet covering the driver's seat was torn off,

54
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,777
so the killer probably wiped away his prints that were in the car

55
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,377
after tearing off the part where his blood stains were.

56
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:16,677
But, what makes you say that the butler may be the killer?

57
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:18,277
If the guy is cautious,

58
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:20,877
it's hard to believe that he would publicize himself,

59
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,977
even for the sake of receiving money.

60
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:27,177
After all, luminol reaction which usually detects

61
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:29,477
the traces of blood even after being wiped off,

62
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,577
wasn't detected.

63
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:34,977
The scars of the three men.

64
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:38,077
There's big one on Mr. Kusumoto's back

65
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,777
and Mr. Banba's chest.

66
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,677
On Mr. Hoya's back there is a small scar.

67
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,477
Mr. Kusumoto used to be thin when he was a child

68
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:50,477
and, Mr. Banba used to be a bookworm.

69
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:51,977
The boy in her memory

70
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,877
was knowledgeable of the sea and fish.

71
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,777
His favourite drink is ginger ale.

72
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,977
His favourite food are sushi and fried noodles.

73
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,477
He is a very honest person.

74
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:05,477
The nickname his classmates named him

75
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:06,777
was Gari.

76
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:09,877
Yes.

77
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,677
How is the investigation coming along?

78
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:17,877
Well... Nothing definite has come up yet.

79
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,277
I see.

80
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,077
Well, there's still more time.

81
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:24,777
A slight meal is ready, so you can eat if you like.

82
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,977
Light meal?

83
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:30,077
Let me guess, it's...

84
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,577
sushi?

85
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:34,677
Yes, amazing how you know.

86
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:36,677
Well, you see...

87
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,077
I've got a secret to tell you.

88
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,277
A little more below.

89
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,177
What're they talking about?

90
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,177
Will you please do so then?

91
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,177
Okay.

92
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:57,677
How surprising, though.

93
00:05:57,677 --> 00:06:01,477
I thought that you were just a short high school boy

94
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:05,277
that still didn't go through a voice change.

95
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,777
But, you're still such a little boy.

96
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:12,777
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

97
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:14,377
Really?

98
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:17,977
I can see what normal people can't.

99
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:22,377
I'll be waiting in my room, then.

100
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,777
I'll leave the rest up to you.

101
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,977
Mr. Detective.

102
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,777
Yes.

103
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,377
Super premium sushi for sure.

104
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:42,577
Why don't you have some too, butler?

105
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:45,977
Kurumi said for you to eat together with us.

106
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,477
Yes.

107
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:48,777
I guess so.

108
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:59,377
Natural stuff is good after all.

109
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,577
No, this is artificially bred fish.

110
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,077
Just what're you talking about.

111
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,077
This is natural stuff.

112
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:07,577
Right, Mr. Detective. Don't you think so too?

113
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:08,977
Oh, well...

114
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,877
I really can't tell myself...

115
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,277
Dad?

116
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:18,377
Natural or artificial, you say?

117
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:22,777
-Who cares? -Who cares?

118
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,677
It's pretty important, I'd say.

119
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,877
I see.

120
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,977
So, is it that you want to make an impression on me

121
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:30,077
that the boy she's looking for

122
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,277
is knowledgeable about the sea and fish and likes sushi.

123
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,477
Is that what you're trying to get me to see?

124
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,977
Oh, no.

125
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:38,577
Well, I guess it can't be helped

126
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:42,277
because 1 billion yen is hanging out there.

127
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:45,977
Talking of sushi, when that boy bought the pack of sushi,

128
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:47,877
what did the boy do after doing so?

129
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,877
The change was 100 yen more than what it was supposed to be,

130
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,277
so I went to return it.

131
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:56,177
I can't take what's not mine.

132
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:58,277
That's strange.

133
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,977
What is?

134
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:02,277
Well... the honest boy who said that

135
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:05,377
he can't accept what's not his

136
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:08,577
is obviously trying to take off with 1 billion yen

137
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:11,277
that should be going to someone else.

138
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:15,277
What're you talking about?

139
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,777
Kurumi is saying that she's going to give the 1 billion away

140
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:21,477
as a token of her appreciation to the person who risked his own life

141
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,477
to save her from a traffic accident.

142
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,377
What's wrong with accepting it?

143
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:29,777
You saw when taking a bath with me didn't you,

144
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,177
the scar from the accident back then.

145
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:35,277
No, the scar on my back

146
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:38,077
is indeed the scar I got during the accident.

147
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:43,077
True, you had a large scar about 30 cm long,

148
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:47,677
but that is again exactly what made me doubt you.

149
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:52,477
Kurumi answered the interview on TV, didn't she?

150
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:55,677
That the scar extended from one end to the other.

151
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,777
She doesn't remember if the scar was on the chest or back,

152
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,077
but it was a big scar.

153
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,377
She said she was sure of that.

154
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,977
Then, how old were you then?

155
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,177
Around 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary school.

156
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:11,577
Really? If the boy was in 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary,

157
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:15,777
a scar reaching from side to side would be about 15 cm...

158
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,977
Well. I guess...

159
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,977
When I first got the scar, it was about that long, but...

160
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,777
As I got older and my body got bigger,

161
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:26,077
my scar got bigger too.

162
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,477
Don't you know?

163
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:33,077
Scars don't get larger even if a person grows up.

164
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,977
-What? -What?

165
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:37,777
If you get a scar that's 15 cm,

166
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,377
the scar stays the same size until you die.

167
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:43,977
Well, I was pretty big for my age.

168
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,277
Me too.

169
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:47,177
Mr. Kusumoto.

170
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:51,777
Didn't you say that you were very thin when you were a child?

171
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,177
I did...

172
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,977
He probably said he was skinny

173
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,577
after hearing that the boy she's looking for

174
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,677
was nicknamed Gari.

175
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,077
He probably mistook it for "gari-gari" which means skinny.

176
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,177
He was actually nicknamed Gari

177
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:08,577
because he was a bookworm.

178
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:11,177
Gari because he was a bookworm?

179
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,577
Do you know?

180
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:17,577
When that boy ate fried noodles at the beach house,

181
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,777
he put a lot of red ginger on it.

182
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,477
What's that about?

183
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:24,877
I don't know about it.

184
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,477
It's only natural that you don't know about it.

185
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,777
I heard about it for the first time today too.

186
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,877
It's a trump card.

187
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:35,377
Don't you understand yet?

188
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:39,077
The boy liked ginger ale,

189
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:41,877
bought sushi packs often

190
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,977
and used to put a lot of red ginger on his fried noodles.

191
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,277
I see. That boy liked ginger.

192
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,977
There's ginger in ginger ale

193
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,977
and the ginger that comes with sushi

194
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:57,177
is ginger marinated in sugar and vinegar.

195
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:58,777
Which means that the reason

196
00:10:58,777 --> 00:10:59,977
the boy got the nickname Gari was because...

197
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:01,377
Yes, that's right.

198
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,377
He was probably called Gari because he loved ginger.

199
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:07,177
That's right, isn't it?

200
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,677
You didn't even bother to eat the sushi

201
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,977
but went right for the ginger and ate it all up,

202
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:14,477
didn't you, Mr. Hoya?

203
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:17,377
No way.

204
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,477
You mean the real guy was here?

205
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:24,477
Yes. He has a scar about 15 cm on his back too.

206
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,977
So, there's probably no mistake about it.

207
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,477
Then, why doesn't he come right out and say so?

208
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:31,977
He could get a billion yen.

209
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,277
I can't accept that money.

210
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:40,677
Because if I didn't tell her to stay,

211
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:44,677
she may have not gotten into the accident.

212
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:46,877
That's why I decided to watch over her

213
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,177
without revealing my identity.

214
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,977
But, it seems that you couldn't do so

215
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,377
without revealing your true identity.

216
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,177
Do you know why?

217
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,377
Kurumi who knew that you're the type

218
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:59,477
that would never accept what is not yours,

219
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:02,377
went on air and publicized

220
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,477
that she wanted to give you the billion yen?

221
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,677
It's because she wanted you,

222
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,577
who was right beside her to come out on your own.

223
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,377
And to tell you to not publicize something like that

224
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:15,477
because it may bring about imposters.

225
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,577
Then... Kurumi knew, after all.

226
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:21,877
Yes, she was aware

227
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:26,877
that Mr. Hoya was the boy she had known back then.

228
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,077
That's why she made him wash my back in the bath tub

229
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:31,577
where the air conditioner was out of order.

230
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:35,277
She didn't say anything about the red ginger till today.

231
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:37,677
She served sushi as a late-night meal.

232
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,877
She did all this to drop hints at me.

233
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:44,077
So, what now, Mr. Hoya?

234
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:47,177
Kurumi is waiting in her room.

235
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:52,477
But... Well...

236
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:54,177
I...

237
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,177
You'll be fine.

238
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:59,677
I'll go tell the lady for you in your place.

239
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:04,077
If you like, shall I go tell her for you?

240
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:06,277
I really don't want people who are just after the money

241
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,177
lying and saying that they are the ones

242
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:09,577
that she is looking for besides.

243
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:15,777
Okay. I'll go tell her myself.

244
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:26,277
He seems to have been urged to do what he has to do.

245
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:27,777
Yes.

246
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:33,977
Jeepers. I'd like to tell the truth if I could, but can't.

247
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,677
Just who are talking about?

248
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,977
Kamen Yaiba.

249
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:42,377
He can't afford to have people know his true identity.

250
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,477
Then, I guess I'll be going.

251
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,277
Bye.

252
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,377
Hold it, will you?

253
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,977
Police?

254
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:56,177
I... I was just joking.

255
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:57,977
I had a scar on my chest

256
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:59,577
that I got when I got hurt surfing, so...

257
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,277
No, the one that we want

258
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:04,977
is the guy with the large scar on his back.

259
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,277
You. That is.

260
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,277
Because after all,

261
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,977
that wound is the straight-line scar

262
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,877
what Superintendent Matsumoto left on the serial killer 20 years ago

263
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,477
when he cornered the culprit.

264
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,677
What?

265
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:25,077
Back then, I didn't know if the scar was on the chest or the back but...

266
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,577
it cleared after I got the mail from Mouri.

267
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,777
Mail?

268
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:30,977
Oh no.

269
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:33,477
I've got to return Pop's cell phone to him.

270
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:36,077
Normally, when people are wounded,

271
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:39,177
they reflexively cover that area with their hands.

272
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:42,877
So, the fact that there was no luminol reaction detected

273
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,677
on the steering wheel of the car that was abandoned

274
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,477
was because the killer couldn't reach his wound.

275
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:52,277
In other words, he was wounded on his back.

276
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,977
Tearing away the cover of the driver's seat

277
00:14:55,977 --> 00:15:00,077
in order to hide the blood stains inside the car gave you away.

278
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:03,477
Oh, no... That's not it.

279
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:06,677
The scar on the back of a man I met before looked cool,

280
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,677
so I copied him and scarred my back.

281
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:11,277
You'd better cut out your wisecracks.

282
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,777
It's true, please believe me.

283
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:17,377
Was that man whistling?

284
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,877
How about it?

285
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,777
Yes.

286
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,277
If I remember correctly,

287
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:25,177
it was a tune that was popular about 20 years ago.

288
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,177
You're not lying, are you?

289
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,377
No.

290
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,877
Superintendent.

291
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:33,477
Popular 20 years ago.

292
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,377
That's the tune of the serial killer.

293
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,099
Ryuhei Kusumoto, age 42.

294
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,499
Around the time the incident occurred 15 years ago,

295
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:52,399
he seems to have been abroad home-staying.

296
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
This has been confirmed,

297
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,999
so I guess he could be cleared from the list of suspects.

298
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,099
I see.

299
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,799
He seems to have met the man with the scar on his back at a sauna

300
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,699
just before he left to go abroad to home-stay.

301
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,799
He seems to have had a towel over his head,

302
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,899
so didn't see the face of the man.

303
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,099
The man seems to have laughed and said,

304
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,499
"This scar was made on my back 5 years ago

305
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,099
by the police and is a crest of courage.

306
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,099
You want to have one like this too?"

307
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,799
Is anyone at that sauna?

308
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,499
Officer Sato and Takagi are staking out there right now.

309
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:27,499
Tell them to stay on their guard.

310
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:28,799
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,399
He's a vicious killer who killed a total of 3 people,

312
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,899
2 people 20 years ago and 1 person 15 years ago.

313
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,299
No, there's one more.

314
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,999
Did you forget?

315
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,399
I'd never forget

316
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,499
about Superintendent Morimura who died on duty

317
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,999
because of that incident.

318
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,099
After all, he's the one who taught me all I need to know

319
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,899
about being a police detective.

320
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,599
Superintendent Morimura.

321
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,199
After you died on duty,

322
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
you were specially promoted 2 ranks,

323
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,099
and I've finally caught up to your rank now.

324
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,099
But, I still don't understand

325
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,899
the meaning of the words you said back then.

326
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,899
Matsumoto, there's some meaning

327
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:23,899
behind the tune that... that guy is whistling.

328
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,599
I'm dead sure... there's something.

329
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,299
What on earth could there be, Morimura?

330
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,899
So there was nothing after all.

331
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:37,099
Nothing at all.

332
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,099
Well, it can't be helped.

333
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,499
It's an incident that happened 15 years ago.

334
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:42,699
I guess so.

335
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,699
The building itself seems to have been renovated,

336
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,699
and the people who come here seem to have changed too.

337
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,799
Come to think of it,

338
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
the sauna at 5-chome seems to have been greatly renovated

339
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,399
and has a good reputation.

340
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,399
That's right.

341
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:57,899
Why don't you invite Officer Chiba and go there with him?

342
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,099
I'll go, alone.

343
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,399
Did you ask me to come with you?

344
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,799
Of course!

345
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,799
Then, why don't we do this?

346
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,199
If we get to arrest this serial killer

347
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,199
before the expiration date,

348
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,799
let's go to a hot spring together.

349
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,999
But, we've only got three more days to go.

350
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:18,399
Take me to a hot spring.

351
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,599
You know what...

352
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,199
I wonder, is it okay?

353
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:25,599
For officers to be acting lovey-dovey on duty.

354
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,599
Oh, no. We're not acting lovey-dovey.

355
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,799
We're questioning the people around here...

356
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,499
Don't tell the children what you don't have to.

357
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:36,099
I know.

358
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,699
If I put together the details of the incident that was aired on TV

359
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:42,699
and what Superintendent Matsumoto said,

360
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:45,399
the first incident happened 20 years ago.

361
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,299
The victim was a doctor, aged 50,

362
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,399
called Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa.

363
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,299
The murder weapon was the Japanese sword that he owned.

364
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,499
Two days later,

365
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,099
the professor of the science and technology department

366
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:01,499
of Tohto University, Mr. Atsunori Mugita, age 42,

367
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,699
was killed with the same Japanese sword.

368
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,499
When the officer who was asking questions in the area

369
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:09,499
about a car that was seen often and thought to be suspicious,

370
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,999
it fled and ran over the officer.

371
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,499
The officer as a result died on duty.

372
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,399
Superintendent Matsumoto who cornered the car

373
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,199
was attacked by the culprit

374
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,999
and was hurt in the left eye,

375
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,299
but despite being hurt grabbed the sword from the culprit

376
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,699
and slashed him leaving a straight-lined wound on his back.

377
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,799
And, five years later,

378
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,199
Lawyer Susumu Nabei, age 34,

379
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:35,299
was killed at his residence with a knife that was in his house.

380
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,599
First the victims were knocked out by a stun gun,

381
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,899
then viciously slashed using a Japanese sword or a knife.

382
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,499
In all three incidents

383
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,799
there were no signs of the door being forced open,

384
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,599
so investigation was carried out under the presumption

385
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,199
that it was committed by an acquaintance.

386
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,999
No common points what so ever were found among the three victims,

387
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,899
and the investigation was coming to a dead end.

388
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,399
Is that correct?

389
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,899
Yes.

390
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,199
But, I don't understand.

391
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,899
The first and second victims were killed with the same weapon

392
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,599
so it was probably the same killer.

393
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,899
Right.

394
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,699
A knife was used to commit the murder five years later.

395
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,299
How did you figure out it was the same culprit?

396
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,599
Well, that's...

397
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,799
That was because the letter

398
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,199
-that was on the victim's body was... -Hey, Officer Sato.

399
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,399
You're telling her about it too.

400
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,499
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:24,399
I can't seem to stop myself when they ask me questions.

402
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,899
-So, there are only three more days to go... -They're still broadcasting.

403
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,199
-Do you think the police... -that incident now.

404
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,299
will be able to arrest the culprit, Mr. Hiramune?

405
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,799
Well, I think it's impossible judging from the present circumstance.

406
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,299
"Doji Hiramune (41)" -The culprit probably

407
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:39,999
has all the curtains closed,

408
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,399
and has all the telephone jacks pulled out

409
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,299
to keep out of contact from everything on the outside.

410
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,599
He's probably shivering in bed waiting

411
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,599
for the three days to go by.

412
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,699
He's probably trying with all his might

413
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,099
to keep a low profile and pass the time away.

414
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:57,499
If this isn't true, come to here to me.

415
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,199
That is, if you want to waste all the effort

416
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,899
you put into fleeing and hiding for 15 years.

417
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,699
I know that man.

418
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,699
He lives in the same condo as me.

419
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,299
Well, we're just about to go over

420
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,299
to your place to play.

421
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,299
We may just run into that man.

422
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,599
True.

423
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,299
Well, the serial killer may come along too?

424
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,499
No. I hope he doesn't.

425
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,199
Ai, you're frightening.

426
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,799
Be careful going home, okay?

427
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,899
If the killer comes make sure to contact us.

428
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,199
-Yes! -Yes!

429
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,799
A certain letter on the bodies of the victims?

430
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,999
Get a load of that.

431
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,999
There's good view of all the buildings in the distance too!

432
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:49,699
I'm sure the night view is also beautiful too.

433
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:50,899
I'm back!

434
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:54,399
I bought some juice.

435
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:56,499
We also got a lot of candy while we were at it.

436
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,699
"Masked Yaiba."

437
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,599
Did you get some Yaiba chocolate too?

438
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,699
Of course.

439
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:01,799
Come to think of it,

440
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,999
we passed a weird man by the entrance.

441
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,799
Weird man?

442
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,799
He was wearing a long coat that didn't seem to fit this season

443
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,799
and was whistling a tune.

444
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,599
What?

445
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,399
What kind of guy was he?

446
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,999
Did you see his face?

447
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,099
No. I couldn't because it was covered

448
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,499
with his hat, hair and mustache, but...

449
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,699
Listen, all of you.

450
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:25,699
Don't leave this room till I return.

451
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,199
Don't tell me that he was actually provoked

452
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:31,099
by Mr. Hiramune who appeared on TV a while ago,

453
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,899
and really decided to come?

454
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,799
The serial killer?

455
00:23:58,699 --> 00:23:59,799
Mr. Hiramune.

456
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,299
It seems that the culprit was whistling

457
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,099
even when Morimura approached that car.

458
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,199
And, he was shedding tears.

459
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,399
So enthusiastic.

460
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:16,599
Maybe it worked a bit too effectively.

461
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,199
I've finally figured out the connection of the four victims!

462
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,699
Next Conan,

463
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:26,599
"A New Scar and the Whistling Man."

464
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,699
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,699
"Z".

466
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:48,399
Ayumi, I'm with you!

467
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,299
Aren't you going to protect me?

468
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,599
Mitsuhiko, what're you going to do?
