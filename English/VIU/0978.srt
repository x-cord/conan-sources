1
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,552
Found a heron.

2
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:10,652
That's a sandpiper, isn't it?

3
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,912
Those are mallards. There're a bunch of them!

4
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:19,131
Look! There's a kingfisher.

5
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:21,771
What? Where? Where is it?!

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,172
Huh? What?

7
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:23,882
Let's see...

8
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:27,162
Now this is a rare find.

9
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,842
That's a thrush.

10
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,552
A woodpecker, maybe?

11
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:38,081
And... a turtle dove.

12
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:39,902
Just kidding.

13
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:43,611
Hey, Conan-kun!

14
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:44,542
Huh?

15
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,692
Conan-kun, what are you doing?

16
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,942
P-People watching...

17
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:57,681
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

18
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,461
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

19
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,581
A case breaks out in a pair of binoculars!

20
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,501
Use your powers of observation to catch the culprit!

21
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,071
Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:06,901
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

23
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,172
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:53,192
The Case On the Opposite Shore

25
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,068
Didn't we agree to go bird watching together today?

26
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,148
Why are you looking at people when we came to look at birds?

27
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:10,068
Sorry. I couldn't help it.

28
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,139
Please, Conan-kun.

29
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,769
But this seems pretty interesting, too.

30
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,269
People watching.

31
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,118
Oh? Looks like they're arguing.

32
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,019
What?

33
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,529
You're right. It looks like that woman is mad at that man.

34
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:32,408
"I'm sorry. Please cheer up."

35
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,389
"Tell me. What's more important, me or your job?"

36
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:39,468
"I don't know what to say."

37
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,938
"I don't like men who don't communicate clearly. Hmph!"

38
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,539
"Hey, wait!"

39
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,549
That's not what this is about.

40
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,799
What is it about, then?

41
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,179
Basically, for example...

42
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,099
See that man in the white polo shirt playing with the child by the slide?

43
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,439
What about him?

44
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,818
You observe him and guess his profession.

45
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,679
What?

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,778
How?

47
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,489
That's impossible.

48
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,529
It's not impossible.

49
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,289
Huh?

50
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,949
First, that watch on his left arm is a luxury watch that costs several million yen.

51
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:27,169
All the clothes he's wearing are simple, but they're designer brands.

52
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,229
Based on that, we can reason that he works a high-paying job.

53
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,108
And more than anything, there's the red strap hanging from his neck.

54
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,639
At the end of it is...

55
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,818
A cell phone for medical use.

56
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,988
In other words, this man is...

57
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,649
This man is?

58
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,468
A doctor.

59
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,868
That's right.

60
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,029
A cell phone for medical use?

61
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,948
Because the waves they transmit are weak,

62
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,909
they're widely used for internal communication systems within hospitals.

63
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,329
Really? Is that right?

64
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,389
You know those signs in hospitals and trains telling you to turn off your phone?

65
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,718
They're warnings intended to prevent adverse effects

66
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:12,339
on people with pacemakers and hospital equipment.

67
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:17,849
Additionally, that red strap indicates that he's a healthcare worker.

68
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,648
Conan-kun, that's amazing!

69
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,219
I can't believe you figured that out just by looking at him.

70
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,478
You guys could do it, too.

71
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,099
What?

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,399
Really?

73
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,769
Yeah. When you observe carefully, you can figure out all kinds of things.

74
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,309
Let's all try it to improve our detective skills.

75
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,969
Yeah!

76
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,188
Okay, then...

77
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:55,869
Let's look at that woman in the light blue dress carrying that big bag.

78
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,578
She's a singer-songwriter!

79
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,208
A makeup artist!

80
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,828
No, she sells eels!

81
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,618
You're all wrong.

82
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,259
Any hints?

83
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:13,569
You should focus on her unique way of walking and her large bag.

84
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,168
She's slender but muscular overall.

85
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,699
You're right.

86
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,768
That's a bold way of walking.

87
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:26,108
But what's inside that bag?

88
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,608
Perhaps a stage costume, like a tutu.

89
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,959
What's a tutu?

90
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,549
I've got it! She's a ballerina.

91
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,828
Correct, Ayumi-chan.

92
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,049
Yes!

93
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,368
The basic position of ballet is called "en dehors."

94
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,158
It means turning your feet outwards.

95
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:52,439
So even while walking, she points her toes outwards and maintains a straight posture.

96
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:56,258
Not only does ballet use a lot of costumes and equipment,

97
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,248
but most people have to carry their own things,

98
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,948
so they tend to carry large bags.

99
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,699
Really?

100
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,308
See?

101
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:10,079
When you observe carefully, you can figure out all kinds of things, right?

102
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,348
Yes, you're right.

103
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,499
All right! I'll guess the next one.

104
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,498
Hey, Edogawa-kun.

105
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,639
Look at the hedges to the right of the water fountain.

106
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,168
Huh? Isn't that...?

107
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,718
I-Is that Detective Takagi?

108
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:42,679
Yes.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,029
And look at the cardboard box behind the fountain.

110
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:47,768
Huh?

111
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,748
Behind the fountain?

112
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,049
Let's see...

113
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:54,799
That's Detective Chiba.

114
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,538
Why is he dressed like that?

115
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,298
Maybe they're on a stakeout.

116
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,009
A stakeout?

117
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,309
If we follow their gaze, we'll find their target.

118
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,859
Let's see...

119
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,059
There! In front of the fountain!

120
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,718
He looks the part.

121
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,958
What does that mean?

122
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,788
He's delivering the ransom in a kidnapping case.

123
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,699
What?!

124
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,999
All officers, report.

125
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:31,999
Nothing strange here.

126
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,739
Nothing strange.

127
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,159
Nothing strange.

128
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:41,699
Nothing strange.

129
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,508
What should we do?

130
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,938
Is there anything we can do to help?

131
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,128
Are we going to the other shore?

132
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,269
But in order to cross the river,

133
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:57,858
whether we go upstream or downstream,

134
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,029
it would take a lot of time.

135
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:06,288
We can't go over there and cause confusion.

136
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,859
Let's watch from here.

137
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:10,038
You're right.

138
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,039
Yeah.

139
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,019
Two guys are coming down the stairs in the middle.

140
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:21,688
They're probably construction workers building houses in the area.

141
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,409
They're unrelated to the case.

142
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,049
One person is coming from the left.

143
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,029
It's hard to imagine a kidnapper dressed in a sailor uniform.

144
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,218
Huh? What's that?

145
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:35,858
It's a boat.

146
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:39,078
Now we can't see the opposite shore.

147
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,899
Hurry up and move!

148
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,408
Hurry.

149
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,909
Hurry.

150
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,409
Hurry up!

151
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,639
All right.

152
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,679
That running woman is heading towards the fountain.

153
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,109
No, it's not her.

154
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,669
She's meeting the man by the river.

155
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,569
Edogawa-kun, what about the man next to the swings?

156
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:25,459
Huh?

157
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,789
He looks the part.

158
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,899
He's clearly watching his surroundings and acting suspiciously.

159
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,849
Is that man the kidnapper?

160
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,619
Bingo. It's him.

161
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,099
Excuse me.

162
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,609
Yes?

163
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,358
I represent Iwabe-san.

164
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,029
Could you hand over the money?

165
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,219
What?

166
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:11,619
Arrest him!

167
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:17,409
No, wait!

168
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:24,919
You're under arrest for the kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!

169
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:29,039
They got him!

170
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,759
Case closed!

171
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,719
Yes!

172
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:42,049
The culprit's been arrested, but something not right.

173
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,416
I knew it!

174
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:01,516
Is something wrong?

175
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,836
It's not him.

176
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:05,625
What?

177
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,625
He's probably not the kidnapper.

178
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,676
Huh?

179
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:13,865
I mean, he is a culprit, but not of this case.

180
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,125
What are you saying?

181
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,466
I don't understand.

182
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:22,945
That man is probably a communications fraud con artist.

183
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:24,265
A con artist?

184
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,446
Huh?

185
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:30,906
I thought it seemed strange for a kidnapper to behave so apprehensively.

186
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,456
That man was probably shocked to hear the charges.

187
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,585
You're right.

188
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:40,955
Now that you mention it, he doesn't seem like a kidnapper.

189
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:42,966
I need to let them know immediately.

190
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,966
It looks like you won't need to.

191
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,096
Look.

192
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:55,916
I told you, I don't know anything about a kidnapping.

193
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,675
Lying about it won't help.

194
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,226
I'm not lying.

195
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:06,085
Yes. Yes, I see. Understood.

196
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,775
I got confirmation.

197
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:13,246
They've got an elderly woman named Iwabe Sayuri-san at Beika Bank.

198
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:16,625
I-In other words, it's unrelated to the kidnapping?

199
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:18,976
That's what I've been saying.

200
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:22,756
Take him away.

201
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:23,676
Yes, sir.

202
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,955
All officers, regroup.

203
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,815
Return to your positions quickly.

204
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,576
Got it.

205
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,896
Did it work out okay?

206
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:40,705
The kidnapper probably hadn't come to the hand-off location yet.

207
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:41,436
What?

208
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,936
The suspect doesn't seem to have noticed.

209
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:53,446
No movement.

210
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,455
I wouldn't say that.

211
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,206
What? Did the kidnapper show up?

212
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:02,586
I don't know that, but look.

213
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,786
The police officers are on edge.

214
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,476
The kidnapper should make his move soon.

215
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:22,806
All right.

216
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,986
Then I'll observe the scene carefully and find the kidnapper.

217
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,805
Me, too.

218
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:31,526
It's time to demonstrate the results of our training.

219
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,216
Me, too.

220
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:43,046
All right. I'll start.

221
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:49,035
I've chosen that man sitting on the bench to the left.

222
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:53,725
Why? Because he hasn't done anything in a while.

223
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,806
If he works in an office, he wouldn't be hanging around a park.

224
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,686
I'm next.

225
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:05,446
I've chosen the large man wearing a yukata in the field.

226
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,715
At first glance, it looks like he's searching for a four-leaf clover,

227
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,366
but he has an evil-looking face.

228
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,116
I've chosen that person.

229
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:22,796
That man wearing a hat who's been doing exercises by the horizontal bars.

230
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:27,876
Since he's been doing warm-ups for so long, he must intend to do something after this.

231
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:31,166
Well? What's your deduction?

232
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:39,355
If the police are on edge,

233
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,396
it must mean that it's nearly the time scheduled by the kidnapper.

234
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:48,136
It's likely the kidnapper is already in the park.

235
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,276
Who is the kidnapper?

236
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:01,076
It's an emergency!

237
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,866
Someone fell in the river!

238
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,666
Someone help!

239
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:11,975
I can't swim!

240
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,296
I'm going.

241
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:15,375
Call the emergency line!

242
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,296
And the police!

243
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,736
Give me the bag!

244
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:32,446
Who are you?

245
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:34,236
Tell me! Where is Mika?

246
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:37,015
Where is she? Is she all right?

247
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,196
Shut up!

248
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,485
That's definitely him this time.

249
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,456
Arrest him!

250
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:42,326
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,326
Gotcha!

252
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:50,836
You're under arrest for the kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!

253
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,466
Yes!

254
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,265
This time the case is closed!

255
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,915
That's great!

256
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:00,846
You're wrong.

257
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:01,766
Huh?

258
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:06,266
That's a decoy. There's another culprit.

259
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:17,526
That's definitely him. He's the culprit!

260
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,906
He, who?

261
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:20,386
I'll tell you later.

262
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,165
Where is Mika-chan?

263
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,225
How should I know?

264
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,166
I was just asked to receive the money here!

265
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:37,325
Don't play dumb! You can't talk your way out of this!

266
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:39,176
Confess!

267
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,495
Detective Takagi, please! Answer your phone!

268
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,895
What? He's in the middle of arresting the kidnapper!

269
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,555
He's not noticing!

270
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:48,345
Detective Takagi!

271
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,166
What are we going to do?

272
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,686
All right. How about this?

273
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,576
Hey!

274
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,946
That's Conan-kun and his friends.

275
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:10,906
Someone's calling.

276
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:13,775
There's no time. Listen quietly.

277
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:14,716
Huh?

278
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,585
The kidnapper isn't that man. There's someone else.

279
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,835
What?

280
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,735
Run to the swings immediately.

281
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,056
O-Okay.

282
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:25,515
The man who fell in the river

283
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:29,415
and the man who came to get the ransom money were probably just hired.

284
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,156
They shouldn't know anything about the case.

285
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,606
How do you know about the kidnapping?

286
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:37,995
Just be quiet and listen.

287
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:40,065
Since time is short, I'll start from the conclusion.

288
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:43,265
The culprit is the man wearing the gray jacket.

289
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:44,305
Arrest him immediately!

290
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,676
G-Got it.

291
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:52,336
The kidnapper first had a hired man jump into the river to distract you.

292
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:57,376
While that was going on, he had another man attempt to seize the ransom money.

293
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,746
The kidnapper himself isn't going to receive the money because he's cautious of the police.

294
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:08,636
But how did you figure out that the man in the gray jacket is the kidnapper?

295
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:13,146
Normally, when a person falls in a river, everyone looks that way out of surprise.

296
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:20,515
If after that, someone attempted to steal an old man's bag, naturally you'd look at that, too.

297
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,775
Y-Yeah.

298
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:26,045
But the man in the gray jacket wasn't surprised at all.

299
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:27,295
I see.

300
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:30,615
That man knew that someone would fall into the river

301
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,655
and that there'd be an attempted robbery.

302
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,536
That's right.

303
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,705
The kidnapper is attempting to flee the park.

304
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:41,316
He's surely mad at the victim for breaking their promise.

305
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:48,005
If you don't arrest him here, the kidnapping victim's life could be in danger.

306
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:50,786
So you can't let him escape!

307
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:54,065
I know, but Conan-kun...

308
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:54,866
Huh?

309
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:59,346
He's not here. The man in the gray jacket is gone!

310
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,066
That's not possible. How?

311
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,746
What? He was there until a second ago.

312
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,086
I can't believe I lost him in the second I looked away.

313
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,435
A reversible.

314
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:17,706
The culprit flipped his jacket inside out.

315
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,966
Damn! That means...

316
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,466
Did he have any other distinctive qualities?

317
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:26,466
Other distinctive qualities?

318
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,976
Remember. Did he have any other distinctive qualities?

319
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:44,796
Those are nice sneakers. Are they limited edition?

320
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:58,746
Could I ask you a few questions about the kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan?

321
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:10,516
You're under arrest for the kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan.

322
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:23,776
Later, after questioning the kidnapper,

323
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:28,185
they learned that both the drowning man and the man who attempted to steal the money were,

324
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,786
as I had deduced, hired by the kidnapper.

325
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:39,476
Kidnapping victim Shibata Mika-chan was discovered safe in the kidnapper's home.

326
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:09,365
Another case closed.

327
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:12,305
And the communications fraud case was resolved, too.

328
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:13,806
That's great.

329
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,806
But we barely did anything.

330
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:21,055
Why not learn from the experience for next time?

331
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:25,066
You're right. After all, that's why we're training.

332
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,815
That person's acting weird.

333
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:30,016
What?

334
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,895
That person is a photographer.
