1
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,848
Ayumi-chan, it's past your
bedtime. Go take your bath.

2
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,723
Just a little more! It's just getting good!

3
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,847
You have swim practice tomorrow, don't you?

4
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,871
Okay...

5
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,847
Who are you? Mr. Dracula?

6
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,122
No.

7
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:05,765
Just a simple wizard resting his
tired wings after flying for so long...

8
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,372
...Miss.

9
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:15,847
There he is! That's him!
Don't let him escape!

10
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,847
Catch the Kaito Kid!

11
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,872
See you, Miss.

12
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,539
Eh? You saw the Kaito Kid?!

13
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,539
Are you serious, Ayumi?!

14
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,664
Yeah! He was so cool!

15
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:46,438
He really is the modern-day Arsene Lupin!

16
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:51,246
So, what is the modern-day
Holmes going to do?

17
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,270
Don't be stupid! I'm gonna
catch him someday, obviously!

18
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:20,830
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.

19
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:24,622
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

20
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:28,270
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal with a man dressed in black!

21
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,246
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

22
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,354
that I didn't notice a second man
sneak up from behind me!

23
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,914
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

24
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:44,246
...my body had shrunk!

25
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,246
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

26
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,246
putting all the people around me in danger!

27
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,455
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

28
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,914
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

29
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,622
To get information on the men,

30
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:04,270
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

31
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,270
I'm the great detective, Mori Kogoro...

32
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:21,246
He's known as "Sleeping Kogoro."
This is because...

33
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,246
...I put him to sleep
with my stun-gun wristwatch

34
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,830
and use my voice-changing bowtie
to solve cases with his voice!

35
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:33,497
These two gadgets are Dr. Agasa's inventions!

36
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,246
Despite how it seems, he's a real genius,

37
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,246
and he's always making
me new, unique gadgets,

38
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,246
such as a Turbo-Engine
Skateboard, Tracking Glasses,

39
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,146
and Power-Assisted Kick Shoes!

40
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,705
In particular, he upgraded the skateboard

41
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,063
so it can run for 30 minutes at
night if it's charged during the day!

42
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,246
But there are two others besides
the doc who know my true identity.

43
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,414
Hattori Heiji, high school
detective from the west,

44
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,330
and Haibara Ai, a transfer student.

45
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:13,246
She originally worked with the men
in black, but to escape from them,

46
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,354
she took the same poison I did and shrank!

47
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,747
While following their organization,

48
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:25,270
I stand up to difficult cases
that happen one after the other!

49
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,563
And now... a new rival has appeared!

50
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,497
I find the ray of light in the
darkness of confusion and suspicion!

51
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:37,246
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

52
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,896
There is always only one truth!

53
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:52,379
Kaito #1412, AKA "Kaito Kid,"
has struck 134 times thus far!

54
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:55,379
15 of those have been overseas,
in 12 different countries,

55
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,797
including America, France, and Germany!

56
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:05,672
152 jewels have been stolen in all!
Total loss of 38,725,000,000 yen!

57
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,755
The truth is, a new warning letter

58
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,403
arrived from the Kaito Kid yesterday.

59
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,755
"When time moves from the twilight
of Leo to the daybreak of Virgo.

60
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:21,047
When a clock with no second
hand inscribes the 12th letter,

61
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:23,463
at a tall building shining in the heavens

62
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,838
I shall appear and take the Memories Egg.

63
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,880
From the Last Wizard
of the Century, Kaito Kid."

64
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,588
Kaito Kid?!

65
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:36,379
The "Memories Egg" in the letter
refers to an Imperial Easter Egg,

66
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:40,379
a treasure of the Romanov
Dynasty, found last month

67
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,838
in the Suzuki Zaibatsu's storehouse.

68
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:47,838
The Imperial Easter Eggs are
eggs made by the jeweler Fabergˇ,

69
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:52,672
as Easter presents for the
Russian empress, from the emperor.

70
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:58,463
Fifty were made between 1885 and 1916.

71
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:03,255
Therefore, this
newly-discovered egg is the 51st.

72
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,255
The Suzuki Zaibatsu will be putting
the 51st egg on display August 23,

73
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,379
at the new Suzuki Modern Art
Gallery in the Osaka Castle Park.

74
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:16,547
Now, as for the coded
message... Nakamori-kun.

75
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,403
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:22,963
First, "...Moves from the twilight
of Leo to the daybreak of Virgo."

77
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:27,379
This refers to the evening of
August 22, the last day of Leo,

78
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:30,379
and the dawn of August 23,
the first day of Virgo,

79
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,838
and indicates the date of the crime.

80
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:37,380
Next is, "When a clock with no second
hand inscribes the 12th letter."

81
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:41,297
It's believed this indicates
the time of the crime,

82
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,379
but it has yet to be deciphered!

83
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:46,047
Lastly is, "A tall building
shining in the heavens."

84
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,588
This is a castle tower!

85
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:52,379
It indicates the Kaito Kid
will appear at Osaka Castle!

86
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,297
In short, this letter says,

87
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:59,005
"Between the evening of August
22 and the dawn of August 23,

88
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,963
I will appear at the tower of Osaka Castle

89
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:05,904
and steal the Imperial Easter Egg!"

90
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:13,088
We will be investigating in
collaboration with the Osaka police.

91
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:16,588
In addition, Mr. Suzuki has
personally asked for the help

92
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,904
of the private detective, Mr. Mori Kogoro!

93
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,379
H-Hi!

94
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:27,672
Our objective here is to
keep the egg safe at all costs!

95
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:32,237
Even if it means letting him get
away, we must keep the egg safe!

96
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:38,880
Don't give me that wimpiness!
The egg comes second! Got it, men?!

97
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:41,379
For our pride and dignity,

98
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:49,279
we police must throw that snobby
sneak-thief into a freezing jail cell!

99
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:57,862
I think I just accepted one hell of a job...

100
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:10,255
Ran! Over here!

101
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,403
Sonoko!

102
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,645
Oh! A limousine, huh?!

103
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,645
That's the Suzuki Zaibatsu for ya!

104
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,563
Today is a special day, after all!

105
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:25,645
Special?

106
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:30,645
I gotta be posh if I'm meeting
my beloved Kaito Kid-sama today!

107
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,146
You're so silly, Sonoko!

108
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,729
"Beloved Kid-sama"?

109
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:39,645
Oh, right! Our driver is
Nishino-san, Daddy's secretary.

110
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:40,729
Nice to meet you!

111
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:44,521
He's traveled all over the world,

112
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:48,063
so he speaks English,
French, and German fluently!

113
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,503
Wow! That's amazing!

114
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,729
It's not fair, Doc!

115
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,645
Conan went to Osaka all by himself!

116
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,104
I wanted to see the Kid again...

117
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:02,938
Running off all by himself is his specialty!

118
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,645
Now, now. Don't be like that.

119
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,645
Here, have some watermelon
and cool your anger.

120
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,896
Alright!

121
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,646
- Thank you for the food!
- Hold it!

122
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,729
You can eat after you've solved my riddle.

123
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:18,645
You can't be serious, Doc!

124
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:20,645
Don't be silly.

125
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,645
You're children. I can't give you
the impression it's easy to get things.

126
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,063
Here goes!

127
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:30,729
"I [washi] have many grandkids
[ooku no mago]. How old am I?"

128
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:34,645
Whoa! You have grandkids, Doc?!

129
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,170
It's just a riddle!

130
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:42,146
I guess it's no use without Conan-kun here...

131
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,645
What happens to this watermelon, then?

132
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,646
Zero.

133
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,896
You're still an egg.

134
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,813
"Washi" can also mean "eagle."

135
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,521
"Ooku no mago" can be
changed to "tamago." [egg]

136
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,729
And you're zero years old if you're in an egg.

137
00:10:55,753 --> 00:11:02,563
Absolutely correct! Well done, Ai-kun!
I knew you could solve it!

138
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:05,645
- Haibara-san is...
- ...amazing...

139
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:09,896
Haibara's part of our Junior
Detective League, right?

140
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,146
Which means...

141
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,670
Thanks for the food!

142
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:25,128
Now let's see how you handle
that other egg, Kudo-kun.

143
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,645
They're really being cautious...

144
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:13,854
I doubt even an ant could
crawl though unnoticed...

145
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:18,271
But of course! We are dealing
with Kaito Kid-sama here! He's...

146
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,645
...an elusive, ever-changing, gentleman thief.

147
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:26,645
He easily breaks through tough
security and safes with his magic,

148
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:32,645
plus he can completely alter his
face, voice, and personality as well.

149
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:38,645
One thing's for sure: that's one
heck of an enemy you've made...

150
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,021
...Kudo.

151
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,271
Hattori!

152
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,021
Him again?!

153
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:49,146
Sheesh! Why do you always
call Conan-kun "Kudo"?!

154
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,645
My bad! It's just that his eyes
remind me of Kudo's, you see.

155
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:55,645
So I always call him that, on accident.

156
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,854
You're so dumb!

157
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:02,438
You kept saying all morning that
Kudo's coming, Kudo's coming.

158
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,645
I think you should probably see a doctor.

159
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:11,438
Hey, is he Hattori Heiji-kun,
the high school detective of the west?

160
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,645
He's a real stud!

161
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:18,645
Don't even try! He and
Kazuha-chan grew up together!

162
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:22,645
They're bickering like that now,
but they're really close!

163
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:27,669
Yeah, I can tell.
They're just like you and Shinichi.

164
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:34,669
If only I had a boy I grew up with, too...

165
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,295
Why, hello there, Mori-san!

166
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,329
Thank you for coming all this way!

167
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,912
No, it's my pleasure.

168
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:58,329
Thanks for coming, Ran-san and Conan-kun!

169
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,412
Say, Sonoko. Who might these two be?

170
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:04,911
Hattori Heiji-kun and
Toyama Kazuha-san, Daddy.

171
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,912
Heiji-kun is known as the
"high school detective of the west."

172
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,329
He's famous in the Kansai area!

173
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,370
That's quite something! I'm depending on you!

174
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,911
Yeah! You can count on me, old man!

175
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:20,329
Hey, you! Don't call the chairman
of the Suzuki Zaibatsu "old man"!

176
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:23,829
Now, now, Mori-san.
Anyway, let me introduce you.

177
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:26,579
This is Sergei Ovchinnikov-san,

178
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,787
1st Secretary of the Russian Embassy.

179
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,995
Nice to meet you.

180
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,911
Next to him is the fine art
dealer, Inui Shouichi-san,

181
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:36,704
who is already asking to purchase it.

182
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:38,911
She's Hoshi Seiran-san,

183
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,911
a researcher of the Romanov Dynasty.

184
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:42,911
Ni hao.

185
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:46,911
And this is Sagawa Ryu-san,
the freelance cameraman and writer

186
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,079
I've hired to film and document the egg.

187
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,704
Hiya!

188
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:54,912
But... purchase? For what sort of price?

189
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,412
800 million.

190
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,620
E-Eight hundred million?!

191
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:01,787
I can pay more, if you'll let me have it.

192
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:06,704
Chairman! The Imperial Easter Eggs
originally belonged to Russia!

193
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:09,911
Don't sell yours to this sleazy broker!

194
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,911
Please donate it to one of Russia's museums!

195
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,412
Who're you calling sleazy?!

196
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,911
Great! That's it!

197
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:21,911
Filming you people might be more
fun than filming the egg itself!

198
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:26,995
You're acting like you don't care,
but if you're a Romanov researcher,

199
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,787
shouldn't you desperately
want the egg for yourself, too?

200
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:36,787
Yes... But I can't
compete with 800 million...

201
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,912
Yeah, huh? 200 million is
the most I could scrounge up.

202
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:46,911
Hey, now. The Kid's not the only
one after the egg! They all are...

203
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:50,911
In any case, we can save discussion
about the egg for a later day.

204
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,079
Understood.

205
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:56,436
Very well. I suppose I'll leave for today.

206
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,829
Chairman! I've brought the egg!

207
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:16,911
Oh, thank you. Put it on
the table, if you would.

208
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,911
Yes, sir!

209
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:21,579
Come, everyone.

210
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:24,787
Wow! He's going to show us the egg!

211
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,911
It's nothing that fancy on the outside.

212
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:30,911
In fact, I unknowingly played
with it as a toy when I was little!

213
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:32,853
A toy?

214
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:46,911
So this is an Imperial Easter Egg?

215
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,954
Nishino-kun, could you
get us some cold drinks?

216
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:50,329
Yes, sir.

217
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,911
I dunno, it's less exciting than I expected.

218
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:56,579
Yeah. It's like an ostrich egg.

219
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:57,995
It opens up, right?

220
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,394
That's right! I'm impressed you knew!

221
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:07,995
Inside is a solid gold model
of Emperor Nicholai's family.

222
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,204
That's really somethin'!

223
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:13,936
This egg does something interesting, too.

224
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,579
Whoa! This thing's cool!

225
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:32,079
In Fabergˇ's old notes was the
design for the inside of this egg.

226
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:35,911
This is what proved it was a legitimate egg.

227
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:40,911
Is "Memories Egg" the English
translation of its Russian name?

228
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,620
Yes, that's right.

229
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:47,911
In Russian, it's
"vospominaniya," or "memories."

230
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:51,829
Say. How is flipping through a book a memory?

231
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:58,537
You idiot! The emperor reading
a book to his kids is the memory!

232
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,911
Are those jewels shining
underneath the egg's lid?

233
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:04,329
No, it's only glass.

234
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,370
Eh?

235
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,579
Even though it's a present
from the emperor to the empress?

236
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:11,537
Doesn't that seem strange?

237
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:17,704
Apparently, Russia was in financial
trouble when the 51st was made.

238
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:20,745
No, the Kid's letter is what seems strange.

239
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,912
"A tall building shining in the heavens."

240
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,911
Why would Osaka Castle shine?

241
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:29,579
You dummy. The retired
emperor who built Osaka Castle

242
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,995
built it as the foundation
for all of Osaka's development!

243
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,329
So it's like the light of Osaka!

244
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,412
Exactly!

245
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:40,911
The Kid will appear in Osaka
Castle's tower! No doubt about it!

246
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:41,912
But...

247
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:45,911
"When a clock with no second
hand inscribes the 12th letter."

248
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:48,579
We just can't figure out what that means.

249
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:53,995
Could it be the 12th letter
in the Japanese alphabet?

250
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,829
The 12th letter?

251
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:59,603
"Shi"? Could it mean 4 o'clock, then?!

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,400
No, that's too simple
for one of the Kid's codes.

253
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,678
I've figured it out, Superintendent.

254
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:10,345
It's not the Japanese alphabet,
but the English alphabet!

255
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,095
The English alphabet?!

256
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,201
The 12th letter in the English
alphabet is L! In other words...

257
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,177
...3 o'clock?!

258
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:23,201
Impressive, great detective! Well done!

259
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,095
That's gotta be it! 3:00 a.m. is before sunrise

260
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,553
and matches perfectly with "dawn of Virgo"!

261
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:37,035
Just you wait, Kaito Kid!
We'll get you this time, for sure!

262
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,553
I got "great luck"!

263
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,177
Let me see!

264
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:48,177
"Waiting: You will reunite
with the person you love."

265
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,177
Could that mean Shinichi-kun?!

266
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,177
- Eh?
- Oh! Good for you!

267
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:55,345
Introduce him to me sometime!

268
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,053
He's right here.

269
00:19:57,077 --> 00:20:02,345
Now, then! The question is how
we pass the time until 3:00 a.m.

270
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,494
For now, I guess we should eat...

271
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,177
Kazuha, show those two around, will ya?

272
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,178
What about you?

273
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,470
I'm gonna show this runt around the place.

274
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:17,428
How come? Come on, let's go together!

275
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:22,553
This is just how men are sometimes.
Right, C-C-Conan-kun?

276
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,177
Yeah!

277
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,636
You're gonna fix that soon, I hope?!

278
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,470
Oh? What's with the attitude?
I can tell 'em the truth, if you want.

279
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,470
P-Please assist me!

280
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,970
Yeah, that's more like it!

281
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:36,177
Can't forget to smile when
asking people for something!

282
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,785
You jerk...

283
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:44,845
It's strange seeing those two get along...

284
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,595
Oh, who cares! We can have a girls' day out!

285
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:52,095
Let's find some hot Osaka men
and have them pay for our meals!

286
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,636
In that case, let's check out Pick-Up Bridge!

287
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,177
You're thinkin' about that
12th letter thing, aren't ya?

288
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:04,095
Yeah. I know what "L" is in
the Russian alphabet, but...

289
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,053
The Russian alphabet?

290
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:08,095
The Russian "L" is the English "K."

291
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,177
Hmm, clock hands can't make a "K" shape...

292
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:17,177
Plus, the "Last Wizard of the Century"
at the end of the letter bugs me.

293
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,595
He's such a snob.

294
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,595
He's never called himself that before.

295
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,177
Plus, the Kid's only ever gone
after jewels. So why the egg now?

296
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,177
Check!

297
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:34,177
Anyways, what fortune did you get earlier?

298
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:36,177
I haven't looked at that stupid thing yet.

299
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:40,970
Why not? It's gonna tell you how
your duel with the Kid goes, right?

300
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,785
Ugh...

301
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:48,944
Oh? "Some luck," huh?
That's a pretty vague fortune.

302
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:54,443
There's no telling if you'll win
or lose your duel with the Kid now.

303
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,443
"The one you wait for will come"?

304
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:02,443
"Travel: Your secret will
come to light. Avoid traveling."

305
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,944
Hey, now!

306
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,676
Don't tell me that means...

307
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,611
Yeah, right.

308
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,361
The fortunes here are right a lot.

309
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,443
What?! No way!

310
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,468
Yes way!

311
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,944
A traditional Japanese restaurant?

312
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:21,443
Yes. We now know the Kid will
appear at 3:00 tomorrow morning,

313
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,694
so what do you say until then?

314
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,443
Sounds great to me!

315
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,069
Chairman! It's time.

316
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:31,443
Oh, yes! I appreciate your help!

317
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:35,443
Oh? Are you moving it to the exhibition room?

318
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,111
- The fake will go there.
- Fake?

319
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:42,611
All previous times, we naively left
the Kid's prey where he indicated

320
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:45,819
in his warning letters,
and he swiped it anyway.

321
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:50,443
This time, we're making it so he
doesn't know where the real one is.

322
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,944
Good thinking! So, where will it be?

323
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:59,444
I'm afraid I can't tell you!
Only my two men and I know!

324
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:02,260
Of course...

325
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:07,760
...I've already made sure
they're not the Kid in disguise!

326
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:11,819
What are you...

327
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,819
There's a chance that you're the Kid, too!

328
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:20,093
In that case, I better
make sure you're not the Kid!

329
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:38,361
My name is Kosaka Natsumi.
This is my butler, Sawabe.

330
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,361
I'd very much like to meet the chairman

331
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:45,319
in regards to the Imperial
Easter Egg in this pamphlet.

332
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:48,361
I'm sorry. The chairman is out at the moment.

333
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,443
I can speak with you, if you'd like.

334
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,468
The egg in this photo is different

335
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,377
from the picture my great-grandfather left!

336
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:02,361
Oh! That's neat! If 3:00 a.m. is
an "L," right now's a Japanese "he"!

337
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:03,443
"He"?!

338
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:09,093
It's 7:13 right now.
At 7:20 will be a perfect "he"!

339
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:17,443
The 12th Japanese letter in that
twilight and dawn line is a "he"!

340
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:22,444
Hattori! The Kid didn't mean
3:00 a.m.! He meant 7:20 p.m.!

341
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:25,443
Say what?! Hey! Where are you going, Kudo?!

342
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,944
Osaka Castle! You guard the egg!

343
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:33,611
Rain? The weather forecast
said it'd be clear...

344
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,443
Wait, Kudo!

345
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,443
The "tall building" isn't the castle tower!
It's the Tsutenkaku Tower!

346
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,444
The Tsutenkaku?!

347
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:43,361
A weather forecast shines
at the top of the Tsutenkaku!

348
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,467
What?!

349
00:24:56,385 --> 00:25:00,885
Ladies and gentlemen!

350
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:10,135
Okay! Let the show begin!

351
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,467
W-What the...

352
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,694
Oh, fireworks!

353
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:34,135
Truly a summer tradition!

354
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:44,111
They're so pretty!

355
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:47,111
Even Osaka's fireworks are flashy!

356
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:50,551
That's strange. Today's not a fireworks day.

357
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:58,085
Inspector! Fireworks are being
launched over by Osaka Castle!

358
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,709
An incredible amount, too!

359
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:02,418
Calm down! That's not the Kid.

360
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:06,709
We still have over 7 hours
until the time he specified.

361
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,709
I doubt he'll ever suspect
that the egg is being hidden

362
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,733
in a warehouse-like place such as this!

363
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,710
Hattori! Which way is the Tsutenkaku?!

364
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,210
That way!

365
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:20,127
There aren't any fireworks over there...

366
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:24,709
The fireworks at Osaka Castle are
to take all eyes off the Tsutenkaku!

367
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:28,377
But why?! Why would he be at the Tsutenkaku?

368
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:32,002
Damn! We can't make it
to the Tsutenkaku in time!

369
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,585
Wait for the Kid here!

370
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,709
Nishino-san! Where's the egg right now?!

371
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:41,085
Inspector Nakamori apparently
took it to a different location.

372
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,151
W-What?!

373
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:50,151
Next up is...

374
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:02,733
A blackout?!

375
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,442
What's going on?! What is this?!

376
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:11,733
Something's not right about this!

377
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,709
Oh! A drink in the moonlight!

378
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:20,026
This is even more elegant!

379
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,709
Stay calm! Switch to the private
generator at once! Quickly!

380
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,710
Yes, sir!

381
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,942
I know what he's after!

382
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:36,734
H-Hey!

383
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,709
The Hoenzaka Mikado Hospital.

384
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,918
The Dojima Century Hotel.

385
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,709
The Tenman Emergency Medical Center.

386
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,709
The Chanel Ten Hotel.
The Naniwa TMS Hospital.

387
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,734
The Kansai World Hotel.

388
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:57,734
Bingo.

389
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:11,317
- Move! How'm I supposed to turn right?!
- Through-traffic gets the right-of-way!

390
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,210
He found out the real egg had
been moved to another location!

391
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:25,127
So he blacked out the whole town
to make them switch to a generator

392
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,085
so he could locate them!

393
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:31,733
It'd be the only place besides
hotels and hospitals with lights on!

394
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,567
The Kid! Dammit!

395
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,793
Crap! A dead-end!

396
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:49,984
Hop on, Kudo!

397
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:53,710
I get it!

398
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:58,085
The Tsutenkaku'd be the perfect
place to see where lights come on!

399
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:02,709
Which means he anticipated all
this when he wrote his letter!

400
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:06,127
And, to keep the hiding
place less conspicuous...

401
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,151
...security would be light!

402
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,733
He's gonna get it if we don't hurry!

403
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,127
Hattori!

404
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:33,192
- You stay here!
- What?! Hey! Kudo!

405
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:49,627
Kid!

406
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:51,127
Damn!

407
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:52,734
Crap!

408
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,234
Hurry, Kudo!

409
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,960
Hang gliders fly best with light headwinds!

410
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,526
Meaning he's flying upwind, huh?!

411
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:40,002
He's starting to lower his altitude!

412
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:44,733
Osaka Bay is up ahead!
The Kid's definitely gonna land!

413
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,127
Hattori! You okay?!

414
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,877
W-What're you doin'?! Get going!

415
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,234
Let 'im get away and I'll kick your ass!

416
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,109
Hattori...

417
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,709
A-Are you alright?!

418
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:09,709
- Call the police and an ambulance!
- Y-Yeah...

419
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,109
Just hold on, Hattori!

420
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,526
What was that?

421
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,192
This injury...

422
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,733
The egg's alright!

423
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,710
That's the Kid's monocle!

424
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,192
Did he get shot and fall into the ocean?!

425
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,733
In which case, who was that man just now?

426
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:19,127
That night, despite their
exhaustive search efforts,

427
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,026
the police couldn't tell
if the Kid survived or not.

428
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,793
The next day, to ascertain
if the egg was undamaged,

429
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:31,793
its display was canceled,
and it was to be taken back to Tokyo

430
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,776
aboard a Suzuki family ship.

431
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,359
My great-grandfather's name was Kiichi.

432
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:57,108
He worked as a craftsman
at Fabergˇ's workshop.

433
00:32:57,132 --> 00:32:59,817
He married a Russian woman there,

434
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:01,109
and the year after the revolution,

435
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,108
they returned to Japan,

436
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:06,359
where my great-grandmother had a baby girl.

437
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:10,776
But my great-grandmother died
shortly after, and 9 years later,

438
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,108
my great-grandfather also
passed away, at the young age of 45.

439
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:18,109
And this baby would be...

440
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,108
My grandmother.

441
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:24,776
My grandfather and my parents
died in an accident when I was five,

442
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,108
so I was raised by my grandmother.

443
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:32,108
She passed away this past month.

444
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:35,984
I was working as a pastry chef in Paris,

445
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:39,817
but I returned here to tend
to her personal belongings,

446
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:44,108
when I found this old drawing
I think my great-grandfather did.

447
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:47,567
The middle is torn out, but...

448
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,108
"Memories..."

449
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:55,942
Indeed, it is the Memories Egg.
But this one has jewels on it.

450
00:33:55,966 --> 00:34:01,341
Maybe it had jewels originally,
but they got taken at some point?

451
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,276
Say. Could there have
been two eggs, actually?

452
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,110
Eh?

453
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:16,108
I mean, look. The contours are
too different to be only one egg.

454
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:19,609
It was actually a bigger piece
of paper with two drawn on it,

455
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:23,108
but a huge part in the middle is missing now.

456
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:25,108
I see!

457
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:29,484
But why is it "Memories"?

458
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:31,550
There's a mirror here...

459
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,609
Oops! It came out!

460
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,984
What are you doing?!

461
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:40,108
There was a mirror in it, but it came out...

462
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,109
What?!

463
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,359
Conan-kun!

464
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:47,484
No, it's okay! That mirror's
made to come out easily!

465
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:50,758
I guess it was added afterwards or something.

466
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,692
Huh? There's an image of something!

467
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:57,216
Could this be...

468
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,298
Nishino-san! Turn off the lights!

469
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:00,489
Eh? O-Okay.

470
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,305
Hey, you! What do you think you're...

471
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,984
H-How is there a picture?

472
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:24,901
- It's a "Magic Mirror."
- Magic Mirror?

473
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,526
I've heard of those!

474
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,109
They're from Japan and China,
where people worshipped mirrors!

475
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:34,108
Yes. They're specially-crafted mirrors.

476
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,108
They say covert Christians in
Japan secretly prayed to crosses

477
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:41,108
that they projected onto walls using them.

478
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:42,984
Sawabe-san, is this castle...

479
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:46,484
Yes. Without question,
it is the Yokosuka Castle.

480
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:52,108
Eh? Yokosuka Castle? The one
often used for commercials and such?

481
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:55,401
Yes. My great-grandfather
was the one who built it.

482
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:58,108
My grandmother looked after it all this time.

483
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:01,108
So that was a Kosaka family castle!

484
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:07,758
Natsumi-san, could your
great-grandfather have made the two eggs?

485
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,108
After the Russian Revolution,
your great-grandfather and his wife

486
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,108
returned to Japan with the two eggs he made.

487
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:23,108
He likely sold many of the
jewels on this second egg,

488
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:28,609
built a castle in Yokosuka,
and hid the egg somewhere inside it.

489
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:33,609
And then he left a message saying
that he hid it inside the castle

490
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:36,192
in a Magic Mirror in another egg.

491
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:41,108
Actually, I also found this
old key with the drawing.

492
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,609
Could it mean something, too?

493
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:48,526
There's no question that that key
is for the second egg's hiding spot!

494
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,317
A mysterious egg, encrusted with jewels...

495
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:58,109
If it's found, it'd be worth
over 1 billion... no, 1.5 billion!

496
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,132
Is that why the Kid went after it?

497
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,776
No...

498
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,693
Mori-san.

499
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:08,108
Could you accompany me to the
castle when we arrive at Tokyo?

500
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:09,609
But of course!

501
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:12,317
- Please allow me to come, as well.
- Me, too!

502
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:15,942
- Yeah! Lemme get it on film!
- I'd love to come, too!

503
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:18,132
Sure! We can all go together!

504
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,454
What the... Everyone's got
a new look in their eye!

505
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:25,545
Are they going after the second egg too?!

506
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:36,556
- There we go.
- Good bird.

507
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,769
Okay! I stopped the bleeding!

508
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:42,311
As long as we keep the wound
wrapped, it'll fly again!

509
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,752
Really?! That's great!

510
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:49,728
Luckily, Hattori-kun only
suffered some light sprains,

511
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:51,996
but do you suppose the Kid is dead?

512
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,939
He would never die like that.

513
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,255
Who knows, maybe he's already on this ship?!

514
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,334
Coming!

515
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:09,418
That's a great expression! Thanks for the shot!

516
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:14,088
What was that?

517
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,310
Hi, Ran! We came to visit!

518
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:21,334
Natsumi-san and Nishino-san, too! Come on in!

519
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:23,934
Sorry to disturb you!

520
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:26,252
Sorry to bother you!

521
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,310
I think I'll pass, after all!

522
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:31,310
Huh?

523
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:34,310
Oh, I get it! He's embarrassed
being around so many beautiful girls!

524
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,793
How cute!

525
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,987
I forgot the other beautiful girl!
I'll go get her!

526
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,930
Okay! Seiran-san, right?

527
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:45,070
- Let's go, Squirt!
- I'm coming too?

528
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:50,102
Yes! Thank you!

529
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:54,019
I'll be ready soon. Just a minute.

530
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:56,228
"Grigorii..."

531
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,310
Oh! Is that a photo of your boyfriend?

532
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:03,478
Eh? Oh, yes.

533
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:06,310
Everyone's got a man. They're so lucky...

534
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:10,228
I totally should've gotten my hands
on the Kid when I had the chance.

535
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:13,960
If you could get him, the police
wouldn't be having so much trouble.

536
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:22,517
So you lived in Paris since
you were 20, Natsumi-san?

537
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,726
That's right.
So sometimes I use strange Japanese.

538
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,517
Speaking of strange Japanese,

539
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:34,517
there's a phrase I heard
as a child and never forgot.

540
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,226
Oh? What is it?

541
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,393
"Barushe niku katta be ka?"

542
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,518
Eh?

543
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:43,517
I think it means, "Did Barougier buy meat?"

544
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:47,517
But I don't know whose name that could be.

545
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,517
Huh? Natsumi-san, your eyes are...

546
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:55,185
Yep! They're gray! The same
as my mother and grandmother!

547
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:58,517
I think we got it from my great-grandmother!

548
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:02,541
Now that you mention it,
your eyes are gray too, Seiran-san!

549
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:07,976
So they are! Do Chinese
people have gray eyes, too?

550
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,435
Say, "Seiran" is written
as "blue orchid," right?

551
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:14,517
My name means "orchid," too!

552
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:19,517
"Seiran" is the Japanese reading.
It's really "Chinran."

553
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,518
Chinran?

554
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:23,435
"Sei" is "Chin," "Ran" is "Ran."

555
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:26,517
"Hoshi" is "Pusu," so it's Pusu Chinran.

556
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:29,517
So "Ran" is pronounced "Ran" in Chinese, too?

557
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:32,435
That's right. "Mori" would be "Maori."

558
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:35,517
So my name would be Maori Ran!

559
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,517
I like how cute that sounds!

560
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,185
Oh, oh! How about me?!

561
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:43,517
Suzuki Sonoko would be "Lingmu Yuanzi."

562
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,935
L-Lingmu Yuanzi...

563
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:51,185
Say, I think we may be about
the same age, Seiran-san.

564
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:53,517
Yes. I'm 27.

565
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,517
I knew it! What month?!

566
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,560
May. May 5th.

567
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:01,685
Eh?! I'm May 3rd! We're only two days apart!

568
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,541
Oh, then you're both one day apart from me!

569
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:11,068
One day apart? That would mean May 4th...

570
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:13,674
That's the same as Shinichi!

571
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:18,967
That's a big coincidence... Could it be?

572
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:22,674
Could Conan-kun actually be...

573
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:34,674
That's so dumb. That couldn't possibly be true.

574
00:41:35,883 --> 00:41:42,883
That's what I get for obsessing
about him. I really am dumb.

575
00:41:56,674 --> 00:41:57,651
Oh!

576
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:01,651
Natsumi-san and Seiran-san!
Why don't you join us?

577
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:05,092
- You don't mind?
- No, be my guest!

578
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:15,568
Wow! You're so nice and sexy!

579
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:17,650
This old man's a lost cause...

580
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:19,443
There you are!

581
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,674
Thank you!

582
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,359
Sagawa-san! That pendant!

583
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:30,568
Oh? I'm impressed. You're definitely
a Romanov Dynasty researcher.

584
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:31,650
Wanna look?

585
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,050
Huh? Was he always wearing that?

586
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:40,650
"Maria"?

587
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:45,568
Is this the ring of Maria,
Nicholai II's third daughter?!

588
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:48,151
I suppose so, if that's what you say.

589
00:42:48,175 --> 00:42:49,883
Where did you get it?!

590
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:57,068
Do you think it's real?

591
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:01,650
I don't know. I would need
to do a more detailed check.

592
00:43:01,674 --> 00:43:05,276
Hey, Nishino-kun.
Your pen's about to fall out.

593
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,508
Oh. Thanks.

594
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,651
Mori-san! Are you there, Mori-san?!

595
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,318
Oh, dinner finally ready?

596
00:43:58,342 --> 00:44:02,526
It's terrible! Sagawa-san is...
Sagawa-san is dead in his room!

597
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,383
What?!

598
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:15,258
Sagawa-san...

599
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:24,650
He was shot in the right eye.

600
00:44:24,674 --> 00:44:26,693
The Kid was shot in the right eye, too!

601
00:44:26,717 --> 00:44:29,967
Hey, you! Butt out, kid!

602
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:33,383
Are you okay?

603
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:40,650
His cheeks are just starting to stiffen.
It's been less than 30 minutes.

604
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:43,758
His ring pendant is gone!

605
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:49,901
Chairman Suzuki! This was a murder!
Contact the police!

606
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:51,842
R-Right!

607
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:54,883
Got it. I'll be right there.

608
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,859
Oh, Inspector Megure.

609
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:03,650
Shiratori-kun!

610
00:45:03,674 --> 00:45:06,359
Weren't you going on vacation to Karuizawa?

611
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:08,651
I find cabin life boring.

612
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:12,842
- Did something happen?
- Perfect timing. Come with us, too.

613
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:32,568
Inspector! We've been expecting you!

614
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:36,650
Honestly! Why do incidents
always happen wherever you go?!

615
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:40,674
I suppose it's a message from God?

616
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:44,284
Are you sure you're not the god, Mori-san?

617
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,225
The god of death.

618
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:53,451
Assistant Inspector Shiratori is harsh!

619
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:56,201
Huh? What's with that bandage?

620
00:45:56,225 --> 00:46:00,391
No, uhh, I had a bit of a scuffle
with a criminal yesterday...

621
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:07,784
The victim was Sagawa Ryu-san,
age 32. A freelance filmographer.

622
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:13,159
Inspector! This was a murder-robbery!
The killer stole a ring!

623
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:14,160
A ring?

624
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:17,783
Yes! It originally belonged to Maria,
third daughter of Nicholai II!

625
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:21,451
Sagawa-san had it on a pendant
he wore around his neck!

626
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:25,576
If it was about the ring, the person
could've just taken the pendant.

627
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,576
But it's weird...

628
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,701
...not only is the room in shambles,
but even the pillow's been cut open!

629
00:46:29,725 --> 00:46:31,784
Are you scampering around again?!

630
00:46:31,808 --> 00:46:34,201
Inspector Megure! This was on the floor!

631
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,701
A pen, huh?

632
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,807
"M. Nishino"?

633
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:46,659
This is definitely your pen,
correct, Nishino-san?

634
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:50,783
Y-Yes. But what was it
doing in Sagawa-san's room?

635
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,784
You're the one who found his body, yes?

636
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:57,784
That's right. Dinner was ready,
so I went to get him.

637
00:46:57,808 --> 00:47:01,201
- Did you enter the room then?
- No.

638
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:06,576
Then why was your pen in his
room if you hadn't gone inside?

639
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,783
I don't know.

640
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,576
Then, what were you doing at around 7:30?

641
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,783
Let's see... I was in my room,
taking a shower at about 7:10,

642
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:17,308
and I took a short break after that.

643
00:47:17,574 --> 00:47:20,050
Daddy, you don't think Nishino-san...

644
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:22,883
No. I don't think he would.

645
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:26,967
If Nishino-san did kill Sagawa-san,

646
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:31,073
then it's possible he's the
one who shot the Kid, too.

647
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,049
Inspector Megure!

648
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:39,049
We've found that all the victim's
videotapes are gone from his room.

649
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:40,883
- What?!
- I get it!

650
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:43,217
That's why the room was ransacked!

651
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,925
Hold it, Conan! Quit running around!

652
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,116
It's okay. I'll get him.

653
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:10,258
Ran-san, the killer could be
wandering around with a gun.

654
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:12,717
Please return to the others.

655
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:14,467
B-But, Conan-kun is...

656
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,050
I'll bring him back myself. Go on, now.

657
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:21,491
- Umm...
- Please let me handle it.

658
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:30,866
Oh, Doc? It's me. I need you
to look up something right away.

659
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:35,425
What? A sniper who shoots right eyes?

660
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,782
Got it. I'll look into it.
Call back in 10 minutes.

661
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:49,699
10 minutes...

662
00:48:58,073 --> 00:48:59,699
Just my imagination?

663
00:49:00,073 --> 00:49:02,467
I got it, Shinichi!

664
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:06,050
I checked the ICPO's criminal database

665
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:09,508
and a criminal with unknown
age and gender popped up!

666
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:13,217
He's known as the Scorpion!

667
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,574
Scorpion?

668
00:49:29,324 --> 00:49:32,550
Inspector! I found it!
It was under Nishino-san's bed!

669
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:34,467
That's impossible!

670
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:37,049
It seems we have conclusive evidence now.

671
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,925
Please, wait! I didn't do it, Inspector!

672
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:44,049
If you're not the killer,
then why did you have the ring?!

673
00:49:44,073 --> 00:49:46,300
I don't know, either!

674
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:49,425
It's almost for certain that
the Scorpion is the killer.

675
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:54,049
Which would mean
Nishino-san is the Scorpion...

676
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,074
Huh?

677
00:49:58,073 --> 00:49:59,550
A rice hull pillow...

678
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:02,049
Conan!

679
00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:05,342
Say! Are you allergic to feathers, Nishino-san?

680
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:07,050
Eh? Yes, that's right...

681
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:10,049
Then you can't be the killer!

682
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,282
What?!

683
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:16,342
Go ahead. Continue.

684
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:17,343
O-Okay...

685
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:21,049
After all, Sagawa-san's room
was filled with feathers!

686
00:50:21,073 --> 00:50:23,925
The killer even cut up the feather pillow!

687
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:27,925
Someone allergic to feathers
wouldn't have done that!

688
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:30,675
Are you really allergic to feathers?

689
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:34,050
Yes. I can vouch for him.

690
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:38,217
Even just a feather or two will
make him sneeze uncontrollably.

691
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:42,049
Which is why he doesn't use a feather pillow!

692
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:48,073
Oh! So that's why he ran from
Ran's room! Because of the dove!

693
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:51,316
So who is the killer, then?

694
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,316
Inspector, have you heard of the Scorpion?

695
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,983
Scorpion?

696
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:59,983
A bad guy who goes to lots of
different countries and always shoots

697
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:04,315
people's right eyes and kills them
to get Romanov Dynasty treasures!

698
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,108
Oh! Now that you mention it,

699
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:09,566
there was someone like that on
the international wanted list.

700
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,108
Eh?! Does that mean our killer here...

701
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:18,315
I believe it's this Scorpion.
He probably shot the Kid, too.

702
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:19,316
Come again?!

703
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,315
The Kid's monocle was cracked, right?

704
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:28,315
The Scorpion shot the Kid down
trying to steal the egg from him.

705
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:31,233
And how do you know about the Scorpion?!

706
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:35,339
- No, I, uhh...
- Dr. Agasa told him.

707
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:39,315
Isn't that right, Conan-kun?

708
00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:41,315
Y-Yeah.

709
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,566
Yikes!

710
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:47,423
So it was Detective Shiratori I
sensed watching me during that call!

711
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,315
"Your secret will come to light!"

712
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:55,757
Was that referring to Detective Shiratori?

713
00:51:58,257 --> 00:52:01,315
But if the Scorpion is the killer,

714
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:06,315
why'd he steal Sagawa-san's ring
and hide it in Nishino-san's room?

715
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:08,566
Beats me...

716
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:15,315
Damn. I can't use the stun-gun
wristwatch in front of Det. Shiratori.

717
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:16,691
I have no choice.

718
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:20,733
Say, you and Sagawa-san
knew each other, right?

719
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:21,316
Huh?

720
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,108
Sagawa-san was shocked when
he saw you at the gallery yesterday!

721
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:27,315
Really?

722
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:31,315
You traveled all over the world, right?

723
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:34,340
You must've met him somewhere, then!

724
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:40,024
You knew Sagawa-san?!

725
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:44,691
Yes! It happened when I was
touring Asia three years ago!

726
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:49,316
He was filming a little girl whose
house burned down in a civil war.

727
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,315
He refused to stop when I told him to,
so I punched him unthinkingly!

728
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:57,149
So Sagawa-san must've
held a grudge against you, then!

729
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:02,315
I got it! Nishino-san! You're the Scorpion!

730
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:03,316
Oh, geez...

731
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,983
Mori-kun, the feather thing
already proved it wasn't him.

732
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:09,816
Oh. Right.

733
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,315
But you really lucked out, Nishino-san.

734
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:13,691
Eh?

735
00:53:13,715 --> 00:53:18,024
After all, had the Scorpion
not killed Sagawa-san,

736
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:20,315
you would've been framed as the ring thief!

737
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,340
Huh? Hold on a sec.

738
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:25,316
That's it!

739
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:31,315
Just like the two eggs, there are
two overlapping incidents here!

740
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:33,233
Two incidents?

741
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:35,024
Now you got it.

742
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:40,316
In the first incident,
Sagawa-san tried to frame Nishino-san!

743
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,774
In order to frame
Nishino-san as the ring thief,

744
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:47,733
Sagawa-san showed the ring off to everyone.

745
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:50,315
Then, while Nishino-san was showering,

746
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:56,149
he snuck into his room and hid
his own ring under the bed.

747
00:53:56,173 --> 00:54:04,108
And then he took the pen.
All to make Nishino-san look like the thief.

748
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:07,983
However, that's when the
second incident took place.

749
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:14,315
Sagawa-san was shot
to death by the Scorpion.

750
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:17,315
The Scorpion was most likely after the ring

751
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:21,315
and a tape that revealed his identity somehow.

752
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:25,691
But the ring hanging from his neck was gone,

753
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:29,315
so the Scorpion ransacked
the room in search of it.

754
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,983
Wow, old man! That's amazing logic!

755
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:35,983
For me, this is child's play!

756
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:41,316
Which means the Scorpion is still
lurking on this ship somewhere?!

757
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,941
About that...
an emergency life raft is missing.

758
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:47,315
What?!

759
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:50,399
So the Scorpion escaped in that?!

760
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:55,024
I put out an emergency APB, but I
believe finding him may be difficult.

761
00:54:55,048 --> 00:54:57,316
Slipped right through our fingers...

762
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,757
Did the Scorpion really escape?

763
00:55:07,132 --> 00:55:12,399
In any event, it's a relief to know
the murderer is no longer on board.

764
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:14,316
Right?

765
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,483
Yes. Very relieved.

766
00:55:16,507 --> 00:55:20,315
But there's still a chance
the Scorpion will appear

767
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:23,733
at the Kosaka family castle for the other egg.

768
00:55:23,757 --> 00:55:25,315
Eh?

769
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:28,315
No, he may be headed there already.

770
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:31,315
Inspector Megure, as soon as
we arrive in Tokyo tomorrow,

771
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:35,191
I'd like to go to the castle
with Natsumi-san and the others.

772
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:37,233
Understood. Do that.

773
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:38,941
Hey! You heard him!

774
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:42,315
You're absolutely not coming along this time!

775
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,816
No. Let's take Conan-kun, too.

776
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,233
What?!

777
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:49,524
His unique ideas could prove useful.

778
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:52,233
His?

779
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:53,507
Yes.

780
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:09,774
That dumb Conan makes me so mad!

781
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:14,233
Yeah! He doesn't contact us
even once after going to Osaka!

782
00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:19,315
He doesn't realize he's a member
of the Junior Detective League!

783
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:23,315
Doctor, have you still not
found your driver's license?

784
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,983
I know I put it around here somewhere...

785
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:30,048
Edogawa-kun's going to
beat us there if we don't hurry.

786
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:42,339
You're so good at finding things, Ai-kun!

787
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,315
It would seem I've found
another bit of trouble.

788
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:50,339
- Eh?
- Tada!

789
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,983
Mori-san, do you think
Sagawa-san's ring really belonged to Maria?

790
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:11,399
I dunno. Inspector Megure
took it in to have it looked at, but...

791
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:16,315
Supposedly, Maria was the
kindest of the four sisters

792
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:19,608
and had large, gray eyes.

793
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:24,774
Gray eyes? That's just like
Natsumi-san and Seiran-san!

794
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,108
I believe you know that the entire
imperial family was shot to death

795
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:31,315
after the Russian Revolution,

796
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:35,983
but the bodies of Maria and the
crown prince were never identified.

797
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:38,339
Really?

798
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,241
It's such a pretty castle!

799
00:58:24,265 --> 00:58:28,116
It's similar to the
Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany.

800
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,324
It's said that it was the model
for the Cinderella Castle.

801
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:36,448
Huh? Come to think of it,
why is it a German-style castle?

802
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:39,723
Natsumi-san's
great-grandmother was Russian...

803
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:47,449
Yo! Conan!

804
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:49,907
Conan-kun!

805
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:53,282
- How are you?
- Doc! Why are you here?

806
00:58:53,306 --> 00:58:59,306
Oh, I got a call from Conan-kun.
So I dropped by while on a drive.

807
00:59:00,472 --> 00:59:04,473
Here. I upgraded them just like you asked.

808
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:06,449
Thanks!

809
00:59:06,473 --> 00:59:09,448
But why'd you hafta bring them?

810
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:13,324
They snuck into the car
while I wasn't watching.

811
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:15,324
This is almost like right out of a fairytale!

812
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:17,616
The treasure must be hidden inside!

813
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,741
I wonder how many boxed
eel lunches it could buy!

814
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:23,448
Listen, you!
You're absolutely not allowed inside!

815
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:26,448
- Yes!
- We know!

816
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:30,448
Oh, geez. They're being
a little too well-behaved.

817
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:32,116
Inui-san is late.

818
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,472
Yes. He said he had to drop
by somewhere along the way.

819
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,324
Sorry about that!
Took me a while to get ready!

820
00:59:48,348 --> 00:59:53,473
What's with the bag?
Are you going exploring or something?

821
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:58,379
It's like they say,
"You can never be too prepared."

822
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:04,173
You'd best be careful. The Scorpion
could be closer than you think.

823
01:00:04,197 --> 01:00:06,738
Yeah. I know.

824
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:27,714
- Please lock the door.
- Huh?

825
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:31,738
- To keep the kids out.
- Yes.

826
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:37,590
- Alright! Let's go, too!
- What are you planning to do?

827
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:39,632
We're gonna find the treasure first!

828
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:42,714
There must be another entrance! Let's find it!

829
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:44,738
Hey!

830
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,714
This is the Room of Knights.

831
01:00:50,738 --> 01:00:54,738
It's decorated with Western
suits of armor and tapestries.

832
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,965
This is the Noble Women's Room.

833
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:06,715
The late mistress often
spent much time in here.

834
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:10,738
She said this was the most comfortable room.

835
01:01:11,738 --> 01:01:15,090
This is the Emperor's Room.

836
01:01:15,114 --> 01:01:18,215
Say. I need to use the restroom...

837
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,738
The restroom is in the hallway,
the furthest room on your right.

838
01:01:48,364 --> 01:01:50,364
Just as I thought!

839
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:18,822
Doesn't look like the egg
is here, but that's okay!

840
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:32,656
What in the world?!

841
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:40,007
This is a security device
Kiichi-sama built 80 years ago.

842
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:43,715
There are many such traps
planted throughout the castle,

843
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:46,714
so please be careful.

844
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:52,590
In short, trying to beat
everyone to it is forbidden, Inui-san.

845
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:55,822
A flashlight should be the only tool you need.

846
01:02:57,656 --> 01:03:03,138
Kiichi-san sure loved his
contraptions. Which means...

847
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,898
Say. Does this castle have a basement?

848
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:07,573
No.

849
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,442
Then where on the first floor
is the great-grandfather's room?

850
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:14,041
Oh, that would be his office.

851
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,148
Please, come in.

852
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:28,980
Photographs of Kiichi-sama
and daily scenes from the time

853
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:31,088
are on display in here.

854
01:03:36,005 --> 01:03:38,980
Say, Natsumi-san. Where are the
pictures of your great-grandmother?

855
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:45,004
Actually, there aren't any.
So I don't know what she looked like.

856
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:50,838
That's odd. There are all these
pictures of Kiichi-san, though...

857
01:03:52,004 --> 01:03:55,394
Hey! Isn't this man Rasputin?!

858
01:03:57,004 --> 01:04:02,622
Yes. That's definitely him.
The signature even says "G. Rasputin."

859
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,942
G. Rasputin?

860
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:08,148
Hey, Dad. Who's Rasputin?

861
01:04:08,172 --> 01:04:13,436
O-Oh, uhh, all I know is he was one
of the century's greatest villains...

862
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:17,189
He was known as Rasputin, the Mad Monk.

863
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:19,273
He won favor with the imperial family,

864
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:22,981
then caused the downfall
of the Romanov Dynasty.

865
01:04:23,005 --> 01:04:25,648
He ruled as he saw fit for a short while,

866
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:31,981
but ultimately, Prince Yusupov,
a relative of the emperor, killed him.

867
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:35,980
When his body was found in
the river, his skull was caved in,

868
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:40,148
and one of his eyes had been...
crushed, or so they say.

869
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:41,980
One of his eyes?!

870
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:46,255
Inui-san, the other egg is more
important than Rasputin right now.

871
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:57,564
Even so, how are we supposed
to find it in this huge house?

872
01:04:57,588 --> 01:04:58,980
Old man! Let me have that!

873
01:04:59,004 --> 01:04:59,981
H-Hey, you!

874
01:05:00,005 --> 01:05:01,898
There's wind coming from below!

875
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:04,023
There's a secret basement under here!

876
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:05,713
What?!

877
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:10,980
And, given that Kiichi-san
loved making contraptions,

878
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:15,005
there's gotta be a switch somewhere!

879
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:20,898
What is that?!

880
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:22,773
The Russian alphabet!

881
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:25,981
That opens the door to the secret basement?!

882
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,231
I think there's a password.

883
01:05:28,255 --> 01:05:30,980
Sergei-san! Try typing in Russian words!

884
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:32,981
Right.

885
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:36,980
It's gotta be "memories"! "Vospominaniya!"

886
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:40,505
Vospominaniya...

887
01:05:43,004 --> 01:05:43,981
Huh?

888
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:46,856
Then try "Kiichi Kosaka"!

889
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,297
Kiichi Kosaka...

890
01:06:00,615 --> 01:06:02,017
Nothing's happening.

891
01:06:02,424 --> 01:06:06,648
Natsumi-san, are there any words
that were passed down to you?

892
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,689
No. Nothing.

893
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:10,980
"Barushe niku katta be ka?"

894
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,980
Eh?

895
01:06:13,004 --> 01:06:17,189
That phrase you mentioned
might actually be Russian!

896
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:20,981
- Hey. What's he talking about?
- Shh! Quiet!

897
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:24,231
Natsumi-san, "Barushe..." what?

898
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:25,856
"...niku katta be ka?"

899
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,980
"Barushe niku katta be ka?"

900
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:31,868
The spaces in the words might be different!

901
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:35,754
"Baru sheni kukatta bekka..."

902
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,060
"Barusheni..."

903
01:06:38,413 --> 01:06:43,979
Could it be "Volshebnick Consta Veka"?

904
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:47,630
Yes! Volshebnik Consta Veka!

905
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,583
What does that mean?!

906
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:55,505
In English, "The Last Wizard
of the Century." In Japanese...

907
01:06:55,718 --> 01:06:58,205
"...Seikimatsu no Majutsushi."

908
01:06:59,218 --> 01:07:03,244
The Last Wizard of the Century?
Why does that sound familiar?

909
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,856
The Kid's warning letter!

910
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,698
That's right! Talk about a big coincidence!

911
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:12,196
Coincidence? Is it really?!

912
01:07:13,004 --> 01:07:15,004
In any case, I'll try typing it in.

913
01:07:15,237 --> 01:07:18,655
Volshebnik Consta Veka...

914
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,917
W-What's that sound?!

915
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:44,877
I didn't know about this!

916
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:51,138
Well done, boy!

917
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:09,630
No luck! This one's locked, too!

918
01:08:09,654 --> 01:08:14,379
Darn it! They're gonna beat us
to the treasure if we don't hurry!

919
01:08:14,403 --> 01:08:17,672
Hey! Ai-kun! Where are you going?!

920
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:20,963
Just going to check out that tower.

921
01:08:20,987 --> 01:08:24,672
Haibara! Is there something there?!

922
01:08:24,696 --> 01:08:27,696
- I bet there's treasure!
- That would be great!

923
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:32,379
It's open!

924
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:33,588
Huh?

925
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:36,379
What's the deal, Haibara? There's nothing here.

926
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,672
I never said there was anything.

927
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:42,403
Hey! We should just give up and leave now!

928
01:08:48,196 --> 01:08:49,779
What?!

929
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:54,987
O-Oh no!

930
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,379
That hurt, you guys...

931
01:09:08,403 --> 01:09:13,297
- You have a soft stomach!
- It saved us from getting hurt!

932
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:14,379
What's this?

933
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:16,403
Snake!

934
01:09:23,403 --> 01:09:26,379
It's not a snake. It's a rope ladder.

935
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:28,482
It's rather old, too.

936
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:32,357
It looks like it originally
hung from up there, but snapped.

937
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,365
Stupid thing, scaring us like that...

938
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,944
What'll it be? Wait here
for the doc to rescue us?

939
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:40,476
Or keep going forward?

940
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:44,107
- That goes...
- ...without asking.

941
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:46,289
Let's go!

942
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,265
- Still, Natsumi-san...
- Yes?

943
01:09:56,289 --> 01:10:00,056
Why was the password
"The Last Wizard of the Century"?

944
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,556
I think my great-grandfather
might have been called that.

945
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:10,515
When he was 16, he exhibited
wind-up dolls at the 1900 Paris Expo,

946
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,265
and then went to Russia after that.

947
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:18,914
I see. 1900 truly was the end of the century.

948
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:30,871
It still keeps going?
This place is really far down...

949
01:10:32,705 --> 01:10:33,682
What is it?

950
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:36,431
- I heard a faint noise!
- The Scorpion?!

951
01:10:36,455 --> 01:10:38,723
- I'll check it out!
- Conan-kun!

952
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,265
I'll go!

953
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:42,847
Mori-san, please stay here with the others.

954
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,122
Got it!

955
01:11:04,664 --> 01:11:05,955
You?!

956
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,847
You guys?!

957
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:19,098
Conan-kun!

958
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:21,515
Geez...

959
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:28,556
? The thing that can attain
your love in this world!?

960
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,847
What are they doing?

961
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:34,015
Come now, Mori-san! The more, the merrier!

962
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,847
Still...

963
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:41,640
♪ The mystery begins to unravel! ♪

964
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,847
♪ You still don't suspect a thing... ♪

965
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:47,080
- Huh?
- A dead-end!

966
01:11:47,313 --> 01:11:49,636
Did we take a wrong turn somewhere?

967
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:53,765
That can't be. There was only one passageway.

968
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:56,529
Which means there's some
kind of mechanism here, too...

969
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,436
Wow! Look at all the birds!

970
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:04,847
Huh? That's strange!
The big bird has two heads!

971
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:08,122
A double-headed eagle... An imperial crest.

972
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:09,243
Yeah.

973
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:12,040
Is that the sun behind the crown?

974
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:15,093
Sun... Light?

975
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:17,289
Could it be?!

976
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:23,872
Shiratori-san! Try putting a
narrow beam of light on that crown!

977
01:12:24,098 --> 01:12:25,503
O-Okay.

978
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:32,497
It shined! What the...

979
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,871
Everyone get back!

980
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,348
An entrance! Now I see...

981
01:12:48,372 --> 01:12:52,871
There's a photometer in this crown.

982
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:06,640
Whoa...

983
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:08,914
What a contraption...

984
01:13:22,299 --> 01:13:25,132
It's like we're inside an egg...

985
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,410
What's this?

986
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:35,765
It appears to be a coffin.

987
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:39,871
It's Western in design, but made of paulownia.

988
01:13:40,304 --> 01:13:42,495
That's a huge lock, though...

989
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:45,231
Natsumi-san! That key!

990
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,164
Oh, right!

991
01:13:56,104 --> 01:13:57,791
So this is what it opens...

992
01:13:58,577 --> 01:14:01,689
Which means inside the coffin is...

993
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:06,497
- May I open it?
- Y-Yes.

994
01:14:09,122 --> 01:14:11,664
It's pretty heavy...

995
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:17,871
One corpse... and the egg.

996
01:14:18,098 --> 01:14:20,300
It's as if the person's
holding the egg while asleep.

997
01:14:20,871 --> 01:14:23,871
Natsumi-san, is this your great-grandfather?

998
01:14:24,186 --> 01:14:27,871
No. I think it might be great-grandmother.

999
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,765
My great-grandfather has
a lone grave in Yokosuka,

1000
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:33,372
which I always thought was strange.

1001
01:14:33,606 --> 01:14:38,348
It's possible that she couldn't
be buried in the ancestral plot

1002
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:41,847
because she was Russian.

1003
01:14:41,871 --> 01:14:48,039
Natsumi-san, I know this is hardly
the time, but may I see the egg?

1004
01:14:48,398 --> 01:14:49,078
Yes.

1005
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,872
Here you are.

1006
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,334
There is a small hole in the bottom.

1007
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,539
It's empty inside?!

1008
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:05,871
That can't be!

1009
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:07,446
What does this mean?!

1010
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:08,871
Inside?

1011
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,247
Is that a matryoshka?

1012
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:13,664
- Eh?!
- A matryoshka?!

1013
01:15:13,688 --> 01:15:16,246
I have one at home!

1014
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,914
My dad's friend bought us
one as a souvenir from Russia!

1015
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:24,246
What's a matryo... shka?

1016
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:29,638
A Russian doll in which smaller
and smaller dolls are placed inside.

1017
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:33,396
Yes, it could be possible! Have a look!

1018
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:38,824
It appears the notches inside are
meant to keep the inner egg in place.

1019
01:15:39,805 --> 01:15:43,781
Damn! If only we had
that egg, we could find out!

1020
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:46,138
We do have the egg.

1021
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:52,905
I thought this might happen,
so I borrowed it from Chairman Suzuki.

1022
01:15:53,137 --> 01:15:57,198
Hey, now. You didn't borrow it
without telling him, did you?!

1023
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:01,137
O-Oh, come now.
You know I would never do that...

1024
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,420
Let's test it out, then.

1025
01:16:07,602 --> 01:16:09,185
It fits perfectly!

1026
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:13,826
In other words, Kiichi-san
didn't make two separate eggs,

1027
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,137
he made the two eggs as one.

1028
01:16:17,499 --> 01:16:19,616
- You seem dissatisfied.
- Yeah.

1029
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:24,906
I can't shake the feeling there's
more to the eggs than just that.

1030
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:29,138
Something worthy of the name
"The Last Wizard of the Century..."

1031
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:32,537
Those are some incredible diamonds!

1032
01:16:32,562 --> 01:16:35,358
No, I don't think they're diamonds.

1033
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,137
Huh?

1034
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,513
I think they might be ordinary glass.

1035
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,747
Glass?!

1036
01:16:40,497 --> 01:16:43,013
Wait a minute! Come to think of it...

1037
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:46,555
The glass on the inside of the egg's lid...

1038
01:16:46,788 --> 01:16:47,779
Kiichi-san's room...

1039
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,781
The mechanism with the light...

1040
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:53,716
And that pedestal!

1041
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:59,091
It has to be! The pieces of glass
in the eggs are meant to be lenses!

1042
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:02,247
Sergei-san! Let me see the egg!

1043
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:03,664
Not more of your...

1044
01:17:03,688 --> 01:17:06,438
Hold on, Mori-san!

1045
01:17:06,618 --> 01:17:08,116
Can I help somehow?

1046
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:09,696
Bring your light!

1047
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,747
Narrow the beam, and put it in the pedestal!

1048
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:17,646
Understood!

1049
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:21,621
Sergei-san! Seiran-san! Put out the candles!

1050
01:17:25,915 --> 01:17:27,914
What's this all about?

1051
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:29,521
Just watch.

1052
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:41,536
I can see inside the eggs!

1053
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:48,020
The imperial family figure is
rising without any winding-up!

1054
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,202
There's a photometer inside the Egg.

1055
01:18:04,537 --> 01:18:06,512
W-What the...

1056
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:08,454
T-These are...

1057
01:18:16,536 --> 01:18:19,305
...photographs of
Emperor Nicholai and his family!

1058
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:25,512
I see! The figures inside the egg
weren't looking at an ordinary book!

1059
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,512
It was an album!

1060
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,513
So that's why it's the "Memories Egg..."

1061
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:37,221
Had the imperial family
survived to receive this,

1062
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:41,388
never would they have
been given a greater present!

1063
01:18:41,412 --> 01:18:48,388
Your great-grandfather truly
was the last wizard of the century!

1064
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:52,512
I think my great-grandmother
would be delighted to hear that.

1065
01:18:52,536 --> 01:18:55,013
Say, Natsumi-san.

1066
01:18:55,037 --> 01:18:59,120
Isn't that your
great-grandfather in that photograph?

1067
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:03,230
That one with two people sitting in a chair.

1068
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:08,802
It is! That must be my
great-grandmother with him, then!

1069
01:19:10,015 --> 01:19:14,713
My great-grandmother... I finally
get to see what she looks like...

1070
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,836
This must be the only
photograph taken in Japan.

1071
01:19:19,389 --> 01:19:22,081
Kiichi-sama must've added it in afterward.

1072
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:25,954
Huh? She...

1073
01:19:30,329 --> 01:19:34,412
...looks just like Natsumi-san...

1074
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:48,220
It seems this egg is Kiichi-san's...
no, Japan's... treasured legacy.

1075
01:19:49,195 --> 01:19:53,653
Russia hereby forfeits the
ownership rights of both eggs.

1076
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:56,592
It appears they are worth
their most in your hands.

1077
01:19:57,615 --> 01:19:59,203
Thank you.

1078
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:03,143
But the inner egg
belongs to Chairman Suzuki...

1079
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:06,512
I'll speak with Chairman Suzuki myself!

1080
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:08,763
I'm sure he'll understand!

1081
01:20:08,787 --> 01:20:12,178
Huh? Come to think of it,
where'd Inui-san go?

1082
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:15,162
Rasputin.

1083
01:20:16,204 --> 01:20:17,702
He wasn't in any of the photographs,

1084
01:20:18,536 --> 01:20:20,381
even though he was close
to the imperial family.

1085
01:20:20,712 --> 01:20:24,628
Yeah. He was in a photo in Kiichi-san's room...

1086
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:31,512
That Russian "G"! It couldn't be!

1087
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:35,512
In any case, all has ended well!

1088
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:37,013
That's...

1089
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:38,512
Now, then!

1090
01:20:38,536 --> 01:20:40,329
Look out!

1091
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:44,721
What's the big idea?!

1092
01:20:44,745 --> 01:20:47,512
Don't pick it up, Ran!

1093
01:20:47,536 --> 01:20:48,888
Ran!

1094
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:50,536
Shinichi?!

1095
01:20:53,537 --> 01:20:55,537
Everyone get down!

1096
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:01,995
The egg!

1097
01:21:03,536 --> 01:21:05,013
Dammit! You're not getting away!

1098
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:06,536
Don't!

1099
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,513
Mori-san! You take care of things here!

1100
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:10,787
Yeah...

1101
01:21:16,215 --> 01:21:17,713
Shinichi?

1102
01:21:43,536 --> 01:21:45,512
Inui-san!

1103
01:21:45,536 --> 01:21:46,745
Dammit!

1104
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:06,709
Crap!

1105
01:22:20,245 --> 01:22:23,814
There has to be a switch
to open it from the inside!

1106
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:27,370
This one spot is a different shape!

1107
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,146
Hold it right there!

1108
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:59,688
You're expecting too much
if you think we'll just let you go!

1109
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,438
We know who you really are.

1110
01:23:02,462 --> 01:23:06,645
You pretend to be Chinese,
but you're really actually Russian.

1111
01:23:06,669 --> 01:23:07,962
Isn't that right...

1112
01:23:09,128 --> 01:23:12,313
...descendant of "Mad Monk" Rasputin...

1113
01:23:12,337 --> 01:23:14,295
...Seiran-san?

1114
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:27,313
W-What's this?! The path's sealed!

1115
01:23:27,337 --> 01:23:29,563
Does that mean we can't get out?!

1116
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,146
Follow me, everyone!

1117
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:31,647
Eh?!

1118
01:23:31,671 --> 01:23:33,063
What?!

1119
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:35,563
Just do what I say!

1120
01:23:35,587 --> 01:23:37,253
O-Okay!

1121
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,645
I didn't realize it at first.

1122
01:23:46,669 --> 01:23:48,563
That voice! Sagawa?!

1123
01:23:48,587 --> 01:23:50,645
When you rearrange your

1124
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:52,938
Chinese name of "Pusu Chinran,"

1125
01:23:52,962 --> 01:23:55,813
you get "Rasputin"!

1126
01:23:55,837 --> 01:24:00,378
I-I killed you!

1127
01:24:06,837 --> 01:24:11,813
The Romanov Dynasty's treasures
were supposed to go to Rasputin,

1128
01:24:11,837 --> 01:24:15,223
who shared a deep connection
with the imperial family.

1129
01:24:16,106 --> 01:24:19,284
Convinced of that, you decided to
gather all those treasures yourself

1130
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:22,142
for your ancestor's sake.

1131
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:25,438
Your insistence on shooting
people in the right eye

1132
01:24:25,462 --> 01:24:29,438
is to avenge your
savagely-murdered ancestor, isn't it?

1133
01:24:29,462 --> 01:24:31,669
I-Inui?

1134
01:24:39,587 --> 01:24:42,063
- I'm alone.
- What?!

1135
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:45,645
This is called a voice-changing bowtie.

1136
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:48,337
It can produce all kinds of voices.

1137
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:50,813
Who are you?!

1138
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:54,378
Edogawa Conan. A detective.

1139
01:24:55,930 --> 01:25:01,062
You killed Sagawa-san because
your identity could've been revealed.

1140
01:25:01,308 --> 01:25:06,263
Because he went to people's
rooms and filmed them on tape.

1141
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,912
It happened so quick that you forgot
to turn the photo upside-down.

1142
01:25:10,936 --> 01:25:17,228
It wasn't a photo of your lover.
It was of Grigorii Rasputin!

1143
01:25:17,935 --> 01:25:23,370
Grigorii starts with a G, and looks
like an upside-down L in Russian.

1144
01:25:23,394 --> 01:25:27,704
So his Russian signature on
the photo in Kiichi-san's room

1145
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:30,579
didn't make the connection obvious.

1146
01:25:30,603 --> 01:25:35,787
Convinced that Sagawa-san
caught your Rasputin photo on video,

1147
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:38,204
you went to kill him.

1148
01:25:38,228 --> 01:25:41,079
Isn't that right, Seiran-san?

1149
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:44,436
Or should I say, Scorpion?!

1150
01:25:45,436 --> 01:25:47,911
I'm impressed, little boy.

1151
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,911
I take it you killed Inui-san

1152
01:25:49,935 --> 01:25:55,079
because he saw you attaching
the silencer to that gun?

1153
01:25:55,103 --> 01:25:58,411
My, my. It's almost
as if you saw it yourself.

1154
01:25:58,978 --> 01:26:03,533
But you went after the old man
because he insulted Rasputin.

1155
01:26:04,436 --> 01:26:06,288
Hey, Dad. Who's Rasputin?

1156
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:11,918
O-Oh, uhh, all I know is he was one
of the century's greatest villains...

1157
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:16,226
And then you even tried to kill Ran...

1158
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:19,374
That's enough talk now.

1159
01:26:19,735 --> 01:26:23,028
It's a real shame, but now
it's your time to die, too!

1160
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:26,428
That gun's a Walther PPK/S, isn't it?

1161
01:26:27,228 --> 01:26:30,433
It holds eight bullets per magazine.

1162
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:36,961
One each for Inui-san, the old man,
and Ran, and the five just now...

1163
01:26:37,103 --> 01:26:38,902
You're out of bullets.

1164
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,941
Here's an interesting tidbit for you.

1165
01:26:43,169 --> 01:26:47,759
If a bullet's already loaded when
you insert an 8-bullet magazine,

1166
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:50,721
you get 9 shots.

1167
01:26:52,353 --> 01:26:56,753
In other words, there's
one more bullet in this gun.

1168
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:00,615
Shoot, then.

1169
01:27:03,194 --> 01:27:05,465
If there really is a bullet left.

1170
01:27:16,706 --> 01:27:18,283
Foolish little boy.

1171
01:27:23,144 --> 01:27:24,811
How?!

1172
01:27:40,186 --> 01:27:42,911
Too bad, Scorpion.

1173
01:27:42,935 --> 01:27:48,795
I asked the Doc to remodel these
glasses with especially hard glass.

1174
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,279
Conan-kun! Are you okay?!

1175
01:27:52,394 --> 01:27:54,811
Y-Yeah! I guess!

1176
01:27:59,353 --> 01:28:02,353
Alright! Let's get out of here!

1177
01:28:04,935 --> 01:28:06,935
Conan-kun!

1178
01:28:24,034 --> 01:28:25,035
I'm saved...

1179
01:28:25,302 --> 01:28:29,135
O-Oh no! The castle is on fire!

1180
01:28:43,412 --> 01:28:45,161
Conan-kun!

1181
01:28:53,102 --> 01:28:55,102
Shinichi...

1182
01:28:56,144 --> 01:28:57,829
You dummy...

1183
01:28:57,853 --> 01:29:00,495
- Conan-kun!
- Conan!

1184
01:29:00,519 --> 01:29:02,779
What? Quit yelling.

1185
01:29:04,935 --> 01:29:06,911
Conan-kun!

1186
01:29:06,935 --> 01:29:10,911
Detective Shiratori took this
egg back from the Scorpion.

1187
01:29:10,935 --> 01:29:14,911
Shiratori did?!
What happened to the Scorpion, then?!

1188
01:29:14,935 --> 01:29:19,704
He arrested the Scorpion, Seiran-san,
and took her away in his car.

1189
01:29:19,728 --> 01:29:20,787
What?!

1190
01:29:20,811 --> 01:29:22,911
Seiran-san was the Scorpion?!

1191
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:26,911
Here! He told me to give
it to you, Natsumi-san!

1192
01:29:26,935 --> 01:29:28,186
Thank you!

1193
01:29:29,728 --> 01:29:31,911
I can't believe Seiran-san was the Scorpion.

1194
01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:34,519
She had such beautiful legs...

1195
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:47,787
Natsumi-san, I'm sorry
it turned out like this...

1196
01:29:47,811 --> 01:29:50,329
Not at all! The castle may've burned down,

1197
01:29:50,353 --> 01:29:55,579
but I still have this precious
egg my great-grandfather made!

1198
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:59,620
Besides, I think the basement will be safe.

1199
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,704
Yes. Once everything has calmed down,

1200
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:07,092
we'll bury your great-grandmother
next to Kiichi-sama.

1201
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:11,935
So the Kid never showed up at all...

1202
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:14,436
Do you think maybe he really is dead?

1203
01:30:14,682 --> 01:30:16,817
No. He's alive.

1204
01:30:42,002 --> 01:30:45,917
The old guy's already asleep.
He seemed really exhausted.

1205
01:30:46,502 --> 01:30:50,400
Yeah. I can't blame him. A lot happened.

1206
01:30:55,214 --> 01:30:56,400
Ran-neechan?

1207
01:30:57,782 --> 01:31:00,684
Thanks for saving me at the castle.

1208
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,263
You were really cool then, Conan-kun.

1209
01:31:06,835 --> 01:31:08,694
You were just like Shinichi!

1210
01:31:11,387 --> 01:31:14,186
You were really just like Shinichi...

1211
01:31:17,543 --> 01:31:18,691
Ran...

1212
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:25,355
But you're different people, right?

1213
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,433
You're different, right...

1214
01:31:32,334 --> 01:31:33,508
...Conan-kun?

1215
01:31:41,331 --> 01:31:43,092
I can't do it anymore.

1216
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,918
L-Listen, Ran...

1217
01:31:52,287 --> 01:31:55,624
The truth is, I'm actually...

1218
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,310
Shinichi?!

1219
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:00,543
Eh?!

1220
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,310
Is that really you, Shinichi?!

1221
01:32:07,334 --> 01:32:09,596
What kind of hello is that?

1222
01:32:09,923 --> 01:32:14,520
I came to check on you after I
heard you got caught in an incident...

1223
01:32:16,127 --> 01:32:18,127
This... can't be!

1224
01:32:20,752 --> 01:32:24,310
You dummy! What were you doing?
Why didn't you ever call?!

1225
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:27,007
Sorry 'bout that.
It's just case after case, so...

1226
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:30,519
I have to leave again tonight.

1227
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:33,168
Wait here! I'll get you some dry clothes!

1228
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,419
Not so fast, Kaito Kid.

1229
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,310
You had me completely fooled.

1230
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:56,682
I never suspected you were on the ship,
disguised as Det. Shiratori.

1231
01:33:08,543 --> 01:33:12,103
Oh! Shiratori-kun!
You did a great job this time!

1232
01:33:12,127 --> 01:33:19,186
Huh? What do you mean?
I just got back from Karuizawa...

1233
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,309
Huh?!

1234
01:33:20,603 --> 01:33:25,168
You knew something
would happen on that ship.

1235
01:33:25,615 --> 01:33:31,835
I wasn't really sure of it, but I
bugged the ship's phone line anyway.

1236
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:33,040
One other thing.

1237
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:37,310
You tried to steal the egg so you
could return it to Natsumi-san,

1238
01:33:37,334 --> 01:33:38,708
its true owner.

1239
01:33:39,515 --> 01:33:43,147
You knew that Kosaka Kiichi-san made it,

1240
01:33:43,627 --> 01:33:47,334
and that he was known as
"The Last Wizard of the Century."

1241
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:50,310
That's why you used it in that letter.

1242
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:53,597
Oh? Anything else you've realized?

1243
01:33:54,898 --> 01:33:58,603
Do you mean how Natsumi-san's
great-grandmother was Maria,

1244
01:33:58,627 --> 01:34:01,710
the third daughter of Emperor Nicholai II?

1245
01:34:04,993 --> 01:34:07,204
Maria's body was never found.

1246
01:34:07,825 --> 01:34:11,310
That's because Kiichi-san
helped her flee to Japan

1247
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:13,285
before she was shot and killed.

1248
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:17,752
Love blossomed between them,
and they had a baby.

1249
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:22,103
But immediately after, she passed away.

1250
01:34:22,127 --> 01:34:26,104
To protect Maria's body from
the Russian revolutionary army,

1251
01:34:26,504 --> 01:34:29,470
Kiichi-san sold her jewels and built a castle.

1252
01:34:30,593 --> 01:34:35,019
But he chose a German-style
castle rather than a Russian one

1253
01:34:35,043 --> 01:34:39,104
because her mother,
Empress Alexandra, was German.

1254
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:46,018
So Maria and the egg were buried
in the secret underground room.

1255
01:34:46,838 --> 01:34:51,304
And in the other egg,
he left a clue about the castle.

1256
01:34:52,127 --> 01:34:55,627
In the hope that a descendant would find it.

1257
01:34:55,828 --> 01:34:58,927
In this way, all the mysteries are solved.

1258
01:34:59,503 --> 01:35:01,809
I have one piece of advice for you.

1259
01:35:02,334 --> 01:35:05,893
There are some mysteries
in the world best left alone.

1260
01:35:07,826 --> 01:35:12,589
Yeah, it might be best to leave
this particular mystery a mystery.

1261
01:35:14,043 --> 01:35:16,335
Then, can you solve
this mystery, great detective?

1262
01:35:16,683 --> 01:35:23,335
Why did I show up as Kudo Shinichi
and help you, a dangerous foe?

1263
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:26,931
Shinichi!

1264
01:35:40,111 --> 01:35:43,464
Don't be stupid. That's no mystery at all.

1265
01:35:44,604 --> 01:35:51,558
You only helped me as thanks for
tending to this guy. Isn't that right?

1266
01:38:45,393 --> 01:38:49,494
Urgh! Why didn't you
stop him for me, Conan-kun?!

1267
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:52,968
But Shinichi-niichan said he'd come back again!

1268
01:38:54,407 --> 01:38:57,739
Good! The next time I see him...

1269
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:06,820
...I'm gonna do that to him!

1270
01:39:08,713 --> 01:39:11,368
I guess I can't turn back to
normal for a while, then...
