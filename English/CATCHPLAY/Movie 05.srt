1
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:29,443
- Wow! It's Mt. Fuji!
- it's so pretty!

2
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:32,154
It's definitely the best mountain in Japan!

3
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:33,805
What's that?

4
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:40,311
Oh, those are the new Twin
Tower Buildings in West Tama City.

5
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:47,068
319 meters and 294 meters in height,
and the tallest twins in Japan!

6
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,237
I wish I could visit!

7
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:53,074
Doc! Let's stop by on our way
home from camping tomorrow!

8
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:58,204
Hmm. It's a little out of the way, but sure.

9
00:00:58,246 --> 00:01:00,748
West Tama City...

10
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,085
That's where I exposed
the former mayor's crimes,

11
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:08,172
and where Moriya Teiji
tried to get the best of me...

12
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:13,553
Still, these guys sure love camping...

13
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:16,723
Camp tomorrow! Camp the day after tomorrow!

14
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,518
"Camp Grounds"

15
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,111
Thank you for the food!

16
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:33,239
Hold on! You still have rice left!

17
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:37,553
My mom said it's bad luck to
waste even one grain of rice!

18
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:43,875
That's correct! Rice farmers
work hard 88 times to make rice!

19
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,418
88 times?

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,794
Yes!

21
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:52,234
If you cut up the character for " rice,"
you get " 88" out of it, right?

22
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:53,468
You do?

23
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,738
- Oh, you do!
- You're right!

24
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,867
That's why the age of 88
is called the " rice age."

25
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:03,311
While we're at it, 77 is
called the " happiness age,"

26
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:06,189
and 99 is the "white age."

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,275
Do you know why 77 is the " happiness age"?

28
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:13,196
Because the character for
"happiness" looks like " 77" in cursive.

29
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:14,214
Right?

30
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:17,825
The "white age" is 99 because
"white" is " 100" with one line missing.

31
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:22,330
Wow! You two always know so much!

32
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:26,501
I bet you guys are
actually lying about your ages!

33
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,252
You got that right...

34
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,606
So now I have a riddle for you!

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,277
Can you guess what age 44 is called?!

36
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:38,221
44?

37
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,283
Here's a hint! One kanji
and three katakana characters!

38
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,725
You don't need to add " age" to the end!

39
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,267
H44"
You don't need to add " age" to the end!

40
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:46,729
H44"
One kanji and three katakana characters...

41
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,064
H44"
What could it be?

42
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:48,606
What could it be?

43
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:54,403
44... 88... Oh, geez.

44
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:58,634
Doc, I figured it out, but man, that's stupid.

45
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,493
You think so?

46
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,955
How about you, Ai-kun?
Have you figured it out?

47
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,266
- I don't know, either!
- Me neither!

48
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,667
Likewise!

49
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:13,548
Then here's the answer! 44 is half of 88, right?

50
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:20,847
88 is " rice." And since this is
half of that, it's " a half bowl of rice"!

51
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,516
Just as I thought...

52
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:26,227
What? What's wrong?

53
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,397
♪ A half bowl of rice!
Let's have two each! ♪

54
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:30,398
Get it?

55
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,326
"Restrooms"

56
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,513
"Restrooms"
I peed my pants a little...

57
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:45,204
"Restrooms"

58
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:53,296
Brr!

59
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,297
It looks like I'll be going

60
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,985
to the Twin Tower Building
in West Tama City tomorrow.

61
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,636
He'll be coming too, of course.

62
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:10,396
Got it, boss! The Twin Tower
Building in West Tama City!

63
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:17,379
They say that's the closest
place to heaven, as I recall!

64
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:21,574
Perfect. It's closest to the afterlife.

65
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:24,243
Let's use it to hold an execution!

66
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,814
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.

67
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:57,818
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,365
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal with a man dressed in black!

69
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,593
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

70
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:09,830
that I didn't notice a second
man sneak up from behind me!

71
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:14,669
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

72
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,773
...my body had shrunk!

73
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:21,300
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

74
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:24,404
putting all the people around me in danger!

75
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:28,224
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

76
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:32,246
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

77
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,521
To get information on the men,

78
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:36,857
I wound up living with
Ran and her detective father.

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,798
Okay!

80
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:46,242
I'm Agasa Hiroshi, genius inventor!

81
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:49,203
Let me use this chance to
introduce my masterpieces!

82
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:53,249
The Stun-Gun Wristwatch!
The Voice-Changing Bowtie!

83
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,310
The Power-Assisted Kick Shoes!

84
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,813
The Turbo-Engine Skateboard!

85
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:01,215
And the Criminal Locator Glasses!

86
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:06,220
One of the lenses has another
new gizmo attached, as well!

87
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:11,726
Infrared Telescopic Vision!

88
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:16,272
I made these all for the now-little Shinichi!

89
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:21,503
He uses these gadgets to
solve cases using Mori-kun's voice

90
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:23,779
and catch bad guys!

91
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:25,114
Take this!

92
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:32,306
Oh, yes! I nearly forgot!

93
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,977
I also invented the Detective
Badges and Wristwatch Flashlights

94
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,713
that he and his classmates use
for their Junior Detective League!

95
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:46,302
Incidentally, besides me,
there are four others who know who he is.

96
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:50,306
His father and mystery writer, Kudo Yusaku,

97
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,327
his mother and former actress, Kudo Yukiko,

98
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:56,479
high school detective of
the west, Hattori Heiji-kun,

99
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,399
and his classmate, Haibara Ai-kun.

100
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,735
Her real name is Miyano Shiho.

101
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,488
She used to work with the men in black,

102
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,618
but after they killed her sister,
she tried to flee the organization.

103
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:17,392
She took the same poison as Shinichi...
and wound up shrinking.

104
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:22,338
The men in black are
relentlessly pursuing Haibara!

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,386
And now, unbeknownst to me,
something's about to happen!

106
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:32,741
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

107
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,726
There is always only one truth!

108
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,484
I feel squished in here...

109
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:48,072
It's because you're sitting in the back!
You sat in the front last time!

110
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,950
It seemed more fun back here...

111
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,327
Hey, Conan. Scoot over more.

112
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,498
Sheesh. It's because you ate 5 bowls
of rice first thing in the morning!

113
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,167
Sorry, I gotta scoot over, Ayumi-chan.

114
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,338
Mitsuhiko! Let's play a game!

115
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,007
Then let's play the ISO-second game!

116
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:11,679
You count 30 seconds in your head,
and then stop the stopwatch.

117
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,515
Cool! Let's all play!

118
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,077
I'm busy driving.

119
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:18,436
I'll pass, too.

120
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:24,650
28.29.30!

121
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:27,820
40 seconds! 10 seconds over!

122
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,801
29.30!

123
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,493
27 seconds!

124
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:35,828
So close!

125
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:38,998
30!

126
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,416
Yikes!

127
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,378
59 seconds?
Are you sure this thing isn't busted?

128
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,380
I think it might be you, Genta-kun!

129
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:52,052
28! 29! 30!

130
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:53,929
30 seconds exactly!

131
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:57,516
- Wow, Ayumi-chan!
- You must be psychic!

132
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,162
It was just luck...

133
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:05,608
Say, Haibara. Who were
you calling so late last night?

134
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,445
I didn't call anyone. Are you sure
you weren't dreaming, Kojima-kun?

135
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,447
Eh? Was I?

136
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,180
It's so tall!

137
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,040
I can't see the top!

138
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,542
It's like it even goes above the clouds!

139
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,759
Is that you, Conan-kun?!

140
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,553
Huh? Ran-neechan! What's going on?

141
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,598
Hey, you! What're you doing here?!

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,643
We came to check out the buildings
on our way home from camping.

143
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:42,645
What about you?

144
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:47,209
Tokiwa Mio-kun, the owner
of this Twin Tower Building,

145
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,944
was a junior student of
mine in college, you see,

146
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:54,448
and she specially invited me
for next week's grand opening!

147
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,717
Oh? I never heard about that.

148
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:59,828
Right?! He didn't even tell me, either!

149
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,790
He only confessed after I grilled
him about his strange behavior.

150
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,501
Confessed?! I wasn't hiding anything!

151
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:09,856
I get it! You two came to keep an eye on him!

152
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,926
After all, Tokiwa Mio-san is the rich
daughter of the Tokiwa zaibatsu,

153
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,803
and still single!

154
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:19,473
And since Ram's parents are
currently separated, she's worried!

155
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,645
Excuse me, but might
you be Mori Kogoro-sama?

156
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,980
Yes.

157
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:29,918
I'm Sawaguchi, the president's secretary.

158
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:35,239
She's with guests at the moment,
so I'll show you the showrooms first.

159
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,119
Building A is entirely for business offices,

160
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,933
and floors 31 and above
are all occupied by Tokiwa.

161
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,751
The showrooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floors.

162
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:50,504
Hey. What kind of company is Tokiwa?

163
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,673
Mostly computer software,

164
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:56,010
but they do all sorts of computer-related stuff!

165
00:10:56,051 --> 00:11:00,014
Does that mean they got
video games, too?! I can't wait!

166
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:10,024
Just look at all these interesting things!

167
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,627
Hello, everyone! Welcome!

168
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,029
This is Hara, our managing
director and programmer!

169
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,530
Nice to meet you!

170
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:19,301
- What is this?
- Is it an arcade machine?

171
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,701
Wanna try it out?

172
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:24,997
This uses a computer to predict
what you'll look like in 10 years!

173
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,126
Oh? What you'll look like
in 1O years? That's amazing!

174
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,878
Doc! Let's try it!

175
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,006
Please sit in the seats, then.

176
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:38,820
I wouldn't wanna see my old
face from 10 years in the future...

177
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:41,472
Are you ready? Here we go!

178
00:11:55,653 --> 00:12:00,616
Here is how you two will look in 1O years' time!

179
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:03,243
Huh? It's no different at all...

180
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:05,663
This machine is broken!

181
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:08,582
No, it's not.

182
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,751
Check out Ayumi-chan's.

183
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,634
So cute!

184
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:22,596
You're way cuter than this girl!

185
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:25,265
Kids don't know
anything about grownup charm!

186
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,601
- Anyways, let's try it, too!
- Yeah!

187
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:33,107
- Eh?!
- Not good...

188
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:35,109
I totally know high-schoolers like this!

189
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,654
Oh! I think you both look nice!

190
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:39,697
Really?!

191
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes!

192
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:43,242
You and me are next!

193
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:49,683
I totally know old ladies like that!

194
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,958
Oh, shut up.

195
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,960
30 pretty!

196
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,063
Oh?!

197
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,297
Looks just like Eri when she was young!

198
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,676
- Almost too good for Shinichi!
- Eh?!

199
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:04,072
It makes me mad to think that
jerk's stringing this girl along!

200
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,849
Don't say that, Sonoko!

201
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,892
Come on, now...

202
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,769
What?

203
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:16,251
- Why are you embarrassed?!
- No, it's not like that...

204
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,819
Next is Conan and Haibara...!

205
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:19,714
Huh?!

206
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:21,655
Hey! Haibara!

207
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:23,323
I'm fine.

208
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:24,950
I'll pass, too.

209
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,661
After all, in 1 O years, I'll look like Shinichi,

210
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,831
and Haibara'll look like Miyano Shiho.

211
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,708
Come on, you!

212
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,837
I'm gonna see what kind of
punk you look like in 1O years!

213
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,672
You too, Haibara-san!

214
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,066
Hold on!

215
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,842
Oh, crap!

216
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,178
I wonder what you'll look like, Conan-kun!

217
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:53,187
Error?! That's strange...

218
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:54,772
Lucky!

219
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,108
It might mean neither of us
will exist 10 years from now...

220
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:04,907
Yes! Certainly!

221
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:09,161
Everyone! I'll show you to
the party room on the 75th floor!

222
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:11,806
Please follow me to the elevators-

223
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,916
- I'm sorry!
- Not at all...

224
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,334
There it is!

225
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:20,106
She was born in the year of the boar,
so she tends to rush recklessly!

226
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,466
Oh, I see! You do that often?

227
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:36,730
This elevator goes directly to the 75th floor?

228
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:42,402
Yes. This elevator is for VIPs,
so it goes directly to the desired floor.

229
00:14:42,444 --> 00:14:46,406
The only place it can be
stopped from the outside

230
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:49,284
is the concert hall on the 66th floor.

231
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,513
So high up!

232
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,789
What an amazing view!

233
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,124
It's like we're getting closer to heaven!

234
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:14,393
We're preparing for the grand
opening party, so it's a little crowded.

235
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,040
Mori-senpai!

236
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,774
Tokiwa-kun! It's been a while!

237
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,777
Thank you for coming all this way!

238
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,280
Yeah, I was planning to come alone, but-

239
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:30,117
I'm his daughter, Ran!
My mother also sends her regards!

240
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,553
Hey now, Ran!

241
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:32,953
Let me introduce you!

242
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:35,080
- My classmate, Suzuki Sonoko!
- Hello!

243
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,058
- Dr. Agasa, the inventor!
- Hello!

244
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:41,855
And Edogawa Conan-kun,
Haibara Ai-chan, Yoshida Ayumi-chan...

245
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,398
- ...Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko-kun...
- Hello!

246
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:46,008
- ...and Kojima Genta-kun!
- Hi.

247
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:49,303
It's nice to meet you all! I'm Tokiwa Mio.

248
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,430
Now let me introduce you!

249
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:57,144
My art instructor and Japanese-style painter,
Kisaragi Hohsui-sensei.

250
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:01,875
Kisaragi Hohsui? The one
famous for his Mt. Fuji paintings?

251
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,484
I know about you, too!

252
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,237
You're Kogoro the
Catnapping Detective, aren't ya?!

253
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,032
That's " Sleeping Kogoro!"

254
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,326
This guy reeks of booze!

255
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:16,330
This is Oki lwamatsu-sensei,
a councilman of West Tama City.

256
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:21,460
He assisted with the construction
of this building in many ways.

257
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:27,174
And this is Kazama Hidehiko-san,
the architect of these buildings!

258
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:31,845
I have a small connection to you, Mori-san.

259
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:35,974
I'm actually a pupil of Moriya Teiji.

260
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,517
Mori ya Teiji?!

261
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,519
But there's no need to worry.

262
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:43,291
I won't blow up these buildings like Moriya.

263
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,943
B-Blow up?

264
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:49,905
Because they're different
heights and unsymmetrical, right?

265
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,240
Oh? You know a lot, little boy.

266
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:59,039
Hurry! Hurry! You can see it so close up!

267
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,041
- It's so pretty!
- it's huge!

268
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:10,509
Oh! This is an incredible view!

269
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,012
You can even see Fuji at night here.

270
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,305
Even at night?

271
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:18,058
What does that mean?

272
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,560
What can you see from the other side?!

273
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:28,110
- What's that?
- It looks like a dome roof...

274
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:30,445
Tower B is for commerce.

275
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:35,009
The lower area is for shops,
and the upper area is a hotel.

276
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,911
There's an indoor pool on the top floor,

277
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,664
and the dome can open and close!

278
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,916
Wow! That's really something!

279
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,963
Say, Mio-kun. Could you let me
stay in the hotel this weekend?

280
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:50,090
But we still haven't opened...

281
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,360
No, in other words?!

282
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:58,032
Very well. I'll prepare
a suite on the 67th floor.

283
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:02,662
I'd like to have dinner
with you too, if possible...

284
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:06,356
That's a strange brooch.

285
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:08,543
A present from someone nice?

286
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,070
No, I got it for myself.

287
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:14,990
Mio-kun! I'll be leaving now!

288
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,575
Oh, I'll accompany you!

289
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:18,577
You needn't see me off!

290
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,058
He seems angry about something...

291
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:28,086
Mio-san bought up all of his
paintings and then sold them for a lot.

292
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:30,088
He wasn't happy about that...

293
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:37,804
Chocolate!

294
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:44,144
Oh, you caught me! I'll let you have some, too!

295
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,146
Yay!

296
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:48,148
- Here you are!
- Thank you!

297
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,984
- Thank you!
- Thanks!

298
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,714
He's a brilliant programmer,
but also very childish...

299
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:58,116
Oh, but that's how he can make fun games!

300
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,159
Oh, yes!

301
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:05,082
I'm working on a new video game;
could I ask for your opinions?

302
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,268
- For a game?!
- Certainly!

303
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:10,045
I live in Soho.

304
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,755
We live in Beika!

305
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,609
That's not far, then! Just a quick bus ride!

306
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,177
Want to come by next Sunday?!

307
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,680
Yes! We'll be there!

308
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,450
What's wrong, Ai-chan?

309
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,767
Nothing.

310
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:32,126
Ran-san.

311
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,154
There's something I'd like
to talk to you about alone.

312
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,466
Could we meet tomorrow?

313
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,468
Sure, that's fine.

314
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:43,120
I'll let you know the time and place later.

315
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:48,166
Ran-oneesan.

316
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,436
There's something I
wanna talk to you about alone.

317
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,795
Eh?

318
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,926
It's the hair. That's the problem...

319
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,682
Maybe I'll try a wave, too!

320
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:09,729
Never thought I'd see a
car like that these days!

321
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:13,191
- What was it again?
- A Porsche 356A!

322
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,276
What?!

323
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:18,113
Hold it! That elevator is for VIPs only!

324
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:20,574
Employees use the general elevators!

325
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:23,136
- Y-Yes, ma'am!
- Our apologies!

326
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,454
Tell me! Where did you see
that car?! What color was it?!

327
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:30,792
Oh, it was stopped in front
of this building. It was black.

328
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,794
It's Gin's car!

329
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,215
Wait, Conan-kun-!

330
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:39,217
Hey! Where are you going?!

331
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,854
Hurry! Hurry!

332
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,900
There it is'.!

333
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,496
Damn!

334
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:11,833
But... Why'd they come to this building?!

335
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:32,872
The truth is, I've always liked
Ayumi-chan since kindergarten.

336
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:37,251
But she seems to like Conan-kun...

337
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,236
Please tell me, Ran-san!

338
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,421
How can we go

339
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:44,383
from childhood friends to
lovers like you and Shinichi-san?

340
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:48,411
H-Hold on! Shinichi and I aren't like that!

341
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:54,227
And, I've started to notice
Haibara-san lately, too...

342
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:59,256
Am I a horrible man to be
fond of two girls at once?!

343
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:09,933
It's not horrible at all!
Liking someone is a very good thing,

344
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:13,246
and I think you should treasure such feelings!

345
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,396
Then...?!

346
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:17,583
But maybe you should just
be close friends for right now?

347
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,627
With Ayumi-chan and Ai-chan,

348
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:23,613
and Conan-kun and Genta-kun too, of course!

349
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,466
I understand!

350
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,535
Half off five donuts!

351
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:29,953
Welcome!

352
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:34,207
I really like Conan-kun.

353
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,210
But he likes someone else.

354
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,480
Do you mean Ai-chan?

355
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:42,424
No. You, Ran-oneesan!

356
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:44,259
Don't be silly!

357
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:47,947
Conan-kun likes you! I know it!

358
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:54,352
So I'd like you to tell him
you already have Shinichi-san

359
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:56,831
so he should give up!

360
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:59,274
U-Uhh...

361
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:02,336
Otherwise, I'll feel so bad for him...

362
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,406
But we don't know for sure
that Conan-kun likes me...

363
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,283
I do!

364
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,409
HOW?

365
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:12,305
My woman's sixth sense!

366
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,663
O-Oh...

367
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,687
Huh? What?!

368
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:23,798
I'm telling you, I think
Conan-kun has a crush on me!

369
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,594
What?! He does not! Don't be stupid!

370
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:30,889
Oh? And how do you know that?

371
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:37,371
No, uhh, childhood love is like the
measles! There's no need to worry!

372
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:42,942
Come on, now! Think seriously!

373
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:47,447
In that case, don't make any strange lies,
and be honest with yourself.

374
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,824
Be honest with myself?

375
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:54,412
If you do that, the answer
should turn up on its own.

376
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:56,414
See ya! I'll call later!

377
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:08,385
I'm the one who needs to be honest...

378
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,649
W-What are you doing?!

379
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,452
I've asked you here for but one reason.

380
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,455
The truth is, a man was found stabbed to death

381
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:39,416
in a suite in the Twin Tower Building.

382
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:41,042
- Eh?!
- That's...!

383
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:44,295
Oki lwamatsu, the West Tama City councilman!

384
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:50,343
I hear you were there when he
asked Tokiwa Mio-san for a room.

385
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,345
- Chiba-kun.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:57,475
Mr. Oki's estimated time of death
is between 10:00 PM and midnight.

387
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,438
We believe a knife was used,
but it wasn't at the scene.

388
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:06,067
But there was an " o-choko" cup
by Mr. Oki's hand, split in two.

389
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,402
O-choko?

390
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,445
This.

391
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,322
This o-choko is quite expensive.

392
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:16,369
There's a good chance Mr. Oki,
fond of sake, brought it with him,

393
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:20,874
and that it's a dying message
indicating who the killer is.

394
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:27,547
In other words, the police think the
suspect is one of those five people?

395
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:33,988
The building still hasn't been
opened to the public, you see.

396
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:39,660
Oh! I got it! The " o-choko"
refers to " chocolate"!

397
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:43,456
The killer was the
chocolate-loving Hara Yoshiaki!

398
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,832
- Eh?!
“No way!

399
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,733
It wasn't Hara-san!

400
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:50,945
He's a nice person!
He shared his chocolate with us!

401
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:51,696
Yeah!

402
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,740
Hey! Quiet, you!

403
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:56,910
Hara-san is most likely in the clear.

404
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:01,474
Of the five people we questioned,
he was the only one with an alibi.

405
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,541
Alibi?

406
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:07,879
That's not nice, Inspector!
You should've said so at the start!

407
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,757
Could " o-choko" refer
to " ochokochof'? [clumsy]

408
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,528
If so, then Mori-san would
be the most suspicious of all.

409
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,429
Hold on, Shiratori!

410
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,056
It's a joke.

411
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:19,724
Honestly, now...

412
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:21,976
What about motive?

413
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:24,103
We're investigating that as we speak.

414
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:30,527
Although a councilman, Mr. Oki
held more sway than the mayor.

415
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:36,115
Supposedly, he even forced
the revision of a city ordinance

416
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,785
preventing skyscrapers
from being built in the area.

417
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:40,787
So that's why Mio-san couldn't say no

418
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:45,625
when Oki-san asked for a hotel
room before the grand opening.

419
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,796
Come to think of it, the brooch she had on

420
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:52,215
looked like that broken o-choko.

421
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,902
Just a minute! Mio-kun couldn't have-!

422
00:26:54,926 --> 00:27:00,557
No. It would've been the
easiest for her to commit the crime.

423
00:27:00,598 --> 00:27:05,478
After all, she lives on
the 68th floor of Tower B,

424
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,749
one floor above the room he was staying in.

425
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:11,067
B-But...

426
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,486
Say. Doesn't that o-choko
look like the small bowl used

427
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:16,906
when doing Japanese-style paintings?

428
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:20,034
My daddy does
Japanese-style paintings as a hobby.

429
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:24,914
It reminds me of a mortar
used to grind the powder!

430
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:28,102
So the o-choko links to Mr. Kisaragi...

431
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:34,674
But it doesn't seem to link to
Sawaguchi-san or Kazama-san...

432
00:27:34,716 --> 00:27:39,846
Shiratori-san, is it true
Kazama-san is Moriya Teiji's pupil?

433
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:41,180
It's true.

434
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:45,911
But he's more of the technical
type than the artistic Moriya,

435
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:48,146
so he doesn't have a preferred style.

436
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:52,585
As for Sawaguchi Chinami-san,
her father was a newspaper reporter,

437
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,195
and he died from overwork when
she was in her 4th year in college.

438
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:59,699
But we've yet to find a
connection between him and Mr. Oki.

439
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:01,034
Inspector.

440
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:05,204
In my opinion, this incident
was meant to disrupt the-

441
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:08,583
Only the lower part of the
closet has blood splatters...

442
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,252
And it's in a strange shape...

443
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:15,006
That isn't for a child's eyes.

444
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,550
Sorry...

445
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:22,281
Still, what were Gin and Vodka
doing at the Twin Tower Building?

446
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:23,681
Wait!

447
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:27,328
O-choko cups are for holding alcohol!

448
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:31,939
Hey, Haibara. Could it have been them?!

449
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:34,901
It's true that they have alcohol codenames.

450
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:40,239
But they'd never be foolish enough
to leave such an obvious message.

451
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,994
...as possible. Got it?

452
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,714
Mitsuhiko-kun! Over here!

453
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,758
You two are early!

454
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,176
This is too exciting!

455
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:03,638
I'm so happy to think we'll
beat Conan to the punch!

456
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,640
Who are you beating to the punch?

457
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:13,940
How did you know?!

458
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:17,836
You guys are always so predictable!

459
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,281
You thought I'd stop you from
investigating the case yourselves

460
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,158
because it's too dangerous, right?

461
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,160
B-Bingo!

462
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,796
It's too late this time, but don't
do stuff on your own anymore!

463
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:38,673
Okay!

464
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,759
Do these guys really understand anything?

465
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,637
So? Who're we seeing today?

466
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,307
Kazama-san and Kisaragi-san!
And tomorrow is Hara-san!

467
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,144
Kazama-san lives in Setagaya,

468
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:55,732
but he has a workroom in Asahino,
just before West Tama City!

469
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:58,651
He's staying there until
the building's grand opening!

470
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,278
Kisaragi-san is single

471
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,824
and built a house in Asahino
with a studio three years ago!

472
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:08,286
Wow. They really did their homework.

473
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:11,956
It's too bad Haibara-san didn't
come too, since we're all going!

474
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:14,268
Huh? You invited her, too?

475
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,209
Yes!

476
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:19,213
But she said she was
busy cleaning house today!

477
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,688
Brother!

478
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:41,277
I guess this is what traitors get...

479
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,156
Brother! Brother!

480
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:56,751
I believe Kazama-san's
apartment is right by the station.

481
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:58,711
And Kisaragi-san's house is...

482
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:02,149
Yeah! Up on that hill!

483
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:05,468
Let's go see Kazama-san first!

484
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:16,020
Wow! This is a CAD system, right?

485
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:18,731
Blueprints are all done on computer, right?

486
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,794
Oh! You know a lot!

487
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:25,112
No one uses drafting boards these days.

488
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,342
What's a drafting board?

489
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:31,869
I see! You've actually never heard of them?

490
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,206
In the old days, you'd put a
piece of paper on a big board

491
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:37,792
and draw with a pencil and ruler.

492
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,877
Oh? Really?

493
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,005
So, do you kids need something?

494
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:44,882
C'mon! Hurry and ask!

495
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:49,095
- M-Me?
- You suggested this!

496
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:51,764
Fine.

497
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:55,434
Actually, Kazama-san! We...

498
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,896
...think this is a nice place you have here!

499
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:02,775
You have fresh air, and you can see Mt. Fuji!

500
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,002
Oh, geez.

501
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:06,505
We're the Junior Detective League!

502
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:07,989
Eh?

503
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,325
We're investigating Oki-san's murder!

504
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:15,413
That's reassuring to hear!

505
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:21,460
Sure! Ask anything you want, little detectives!

506
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:26,465
Okay, then. What was your
opinion of the late Oki-san?

507
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,135
Right off the bat, I see.

508
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:31,429
A rude old man, I suppose.

509
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,142
But I got this job because he
revised the city building ordinance,

510
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:38,412
so in that sense, I'm thankful to him.

511
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:43,566
Did you argue with him about
anything during the drafting stage?

512
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,818
Nothing with Oki-san...

513
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,904
You argued with someone else, then?

514
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:51,240
Eh? No, that's not what I meant...

515
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,120
Oh? That photo...

516
00:32:56,162 --> 00:33:00,917
Oh. He's my son. Cute, isn't he?

517
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:05,880
I really miss his voice when
I'm working alone at night.

518
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:10,217
I sometimes call when I know
he's asleep. I'm such a doting father!

519
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:23,314
C'mon...

520
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:30,112
Umm... We're the Junior Detective League...

521
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,409
We're investigating Oki-san's-

522
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,372
Children have no place
acting like the authorities!

523
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:41,040
No, uhh-!

524
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:50,216
But it would be a shame
to leave empty-handed.

525
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:58,891
I appreciate the drawing, but...

526
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,227
We didn't get to ask about the incident.

527
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:04,397
I guess the police should handle it, huh?

528
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:07,000
Exactly.

529
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:08,985
It's 6:00. Let's head home now.

530
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,166
W-What was that sound?!

531
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,544
Oh, just me snoring?

532
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:42,995
Haibara was on the phone
in the middle of the night?

533
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,541
Remember what Genta-kun
said when we went camping?

534
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:51,378
I guess she really was on the phone...

535
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:55,489
But she has no one to call, right?

536
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,950
I trust her.

537
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:02,222
But there is a small chance
that her fear of the men in black

538
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,207
could've made her join
the organization again...

539
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,379
It's okay, Doc. There's no need to worry. Later!

540
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:17,970
Hey! You're all early!

541
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:19,138
Good morning, Conan-kun!

542
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,974
- What took so long?!
- We've been waiting!

543
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,393
Haibara-san wants to visit Hara-san, too!

544
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,979
Eh? Oh.

545
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:32,651
What's wrong with that?
I'm interested in his video games, too.

546
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,038
Room 407. This is Hara-san's apartment!

547
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,585
Huh? The door's open...

548
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,004
That's careless of him!

549
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:54,006
Hara-san! We're here!

550
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:59,303
C-Conan-kun! Hara-san is...!

551
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:02,723
Police and ambulance!

552
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:12,650
He was shot in the chest!
He died almost instantly!

553
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,087
A knife?!

554
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:17,113
He was about to have cake?

555
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:22,761
An o-choko cup!

556
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:25,246
Which means it was the same killer!

557
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:34,380
Well, Examiner?

558
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:38,092
We'll need to do an autopsy to be sure,

559
00:36:38,134 --> 00:36:43,055
but he died between yesterday
afternoon and yesterday evening.

560
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:47,059
It appears he was about to
have some chocolate cake.

561
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:53,566
Then, when the killer entered,
he tried to fight with his silver knife...

562
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:58,070
But what should we think
about this o-choko cup?

563
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:03,135
Isn't it obvious? It's a serial
murder committed by Mr. Oki's killer.

564
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,581
It's now likely the o-choko cups
are not the victims' dying messages,

565
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:11,750
but rather messages from the killer.

566
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,520
Hey there, kid!

567
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:15,522
Are you done already, Tome-san?

568
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:19,675
Yeah. Say, I hear you
were the ones who found him?

569
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:22,154
Yeah. It was a shock.

570
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:24,096
Oh, is that the o-choko cup?

571
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,532
That's right.

572
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:27,850
Huh? There's no blood on it.

573
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:32,730
Say, Tome-san. Is that all of the cup?

574
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:36,650
Of course! Nothing escapes Tome the Examiner!

575
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:38,110
Bye, now!

576
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:43,115
Now is it clear it's not them?
They'd never leave those behind.

577
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:52,875
After conducting an autopsy,
we know his approximate time of death.

578
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,562
Yesterday evening, between 5:00 and 6:00.

579
00:37:55,586 --> 00:38:00,633
Also, all of Mr. Hara's
computer data had been erased.

580
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:04,136
It's possible that was the motive.

581
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,639
Mr. Kisaragi was with
Conan-kun and his friends

582
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,308
between 5:00 and 6:00, so he's in the clear.

583
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,687
On the other hand, Mr. Kazama
could've driven there in time

584
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:15,773
after Conan-kun and the others left.

585
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:18,150
What about Mio-kun?

586
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:22,238
Neither Tokiwa-san nor
Sawaguchi-san has a clear alibi.

587
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:25,157
I'm sorry, Mori-kun, but I think the killer is

588
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:31,163
Tokiwa Mio-san, Kazama Hidehiko,
or Sawaguchi Chinami-san.

589
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:35,769
And it's very possible that
these incidents will continue.

590
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:41,924
So Inspector Megure suggested
postponing the party this Saturday,

591
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,717
but she wouldn't listen.

592
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:46,720
Not only that, she gave me this to give to you.

593
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:53,245
This is an invitation to the party...

594
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:57,856
And Conan-kun, the children,
and I are all listed, too!

595
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:59,650
Eh?! Us too?!

596
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:02,987
Honestly! What is she thinking?

597
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,349
Boss'.!

598
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,827
This the place?

599
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,730
The manager confirmed her picture.

600
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:43,277
To think she holed up in this dump
to hide from the organization...

601
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,821
The rent was paid an entire year in advance,

602
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,240
and nobody ever answers the phone.

603
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:53,996
The neighbors say messages
get left on it sometimes,

604
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:57,916
but strangely enough,
when I checked the machine...

605
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:00,919
...There were no messages recorded.

606
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:06,550
Eh?! Y-Yes. What's that all about?

607
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:10,429
Women will be women.

608
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:14,892
There's a computer in the car. Go get it.

609
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:18,270
The organization's phone-tracing program.

610
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:22,566
With this, we can trace calls in 20 seconds.

611
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:23,901
Gotcha!

612
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:10,864
Hello, this is Miyano. I'm not home right now.

613
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:14,868
Please leave your name
and message after the beep.

614
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:19,706
Sister? It's me.

615
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:23,710
I'm going to the Twin Tower
Building's opening party-

616
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:26,422
"Unable to trace"

617
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:32,779
Kudo-kun...

618
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,848
So you were calling your sister.

619
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:41,353
The phone in the apartment
she used when she was alive.

620
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:45,691
Now I see! You wanted
to talk to your late sister.

621
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:51,131
I can imagine how you feel,
but it's too dangerous-

622
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,782
No one knows how I feel!

623
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:58,579
- Hey, Haibara!
- Hold on!

624
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,581
Let her be for now.

625
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:21,727
Damn! Just a few more
seconds and we would've had it!

626
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:22,686
Boss'.!

627
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:28,501
Hello, this is Miyano. I'm not
home right now. Please leave-

628
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:30,670
She erased the message!

629
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:34,615
You don't think she knows we're here, do you?!

630
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:41,455
No, that's not it. She erased the
message so no one will hear it later.

631
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:44,416
Never in her dreams would she
think we're sitting next to the phone,

632
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,711
listening in on her.

633
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:50,255
Think she'll call again?

634
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:52,799
I doubt it.

635
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:58,472
But it sounds like the heavens
are offering us their support!

636
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:01,141
The Twin Tower Building's opening party...

637
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,106
I'll finally get to see it, Sherry.

638
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:11,777
Your cold, dead face...

639
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,187
I'm sorry about last night.

640
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:36,468
I knew it was dangerous, too.
I knew I had to stop at some point.

641
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,807
Even so, whenever I would
feel especially alone or afraid,

642
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:44,643
I would pick up the phone without thinking...

643
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:48,647
Just to hear those 10 seconds
of my sister's voice...

644
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:51,650
Don't be stupid. You're not alone.

645
00:43:55,571 --> 00:44:00,617
I figured it was about time
to call it quits, so I'll stop.

646
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:03,453
Don't worry. I deleted the message.

647
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:10,961
But lately, I wonder who I am...

648
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,052
I wonder who I am, and where I belong...

649
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:21,948
I have no place to be.

650
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:24,808
Eh?! You have no place?!

651
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,685
What're you talking about, Haibara?

652
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:30,814
You have a seat right there!

653
00:44:30,856 --> 00:44:32,566
This is mine!

654
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:34,026
This is my place!

655
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:36,028
And this is mine!

656
00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:41,074
See? I told you you're not alone.

657
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,793
"Central Surveillance Room"

658
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,913
C'mon! Where's the spoiled rich girl?!

659
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:29,706
She said she's on her way.

660
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:31,583
I can't wait for the party!

661
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:35,688
- I bet there'll be a lot of food!
- I want boxed eel lunches!

662
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,691
I don't think they'll have that.

663
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:41,593
Say. Do you think Hara-san,
the managing director,

664
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:45,639
could've been working with the men in black?

665
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:47,724
It's possible.

666
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:50,602
They've been bringing in
promising young people from all fields,

667
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:54,606
including politicians, businessmen,
doctors, scientists, and more.

668
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:56,334
Even Councilman Oki?

669
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,903
He didn't have much power,
but maybe when he was younger.

670
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:03,049
In any case, once inside the organization,

671
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:09,121
whoever tries to leave or betray
it can expect a death sentence.

672
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:11,790
Just like how they're trying to kill me.

673
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:16,169
In which case,
if the killer is one of those four...

674
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:16,962
Yeah.

675
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:20,966
There's a good chance they're
connected with the organization, too.

676
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:23,760
Hi! Sorry for the wait!

677
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:26,805
Sonoko! What happened to your hair?!

678
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:29,725
It's an image change!

679
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:32,978
I decided to take after her and try a wave!

680
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:35,647
Well? Does it look good on me?

681
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,987
Huh?! It looks like you wanna say something!

682
00:46:42,028 --> 00:46:43,756
N-No, I don't!

683
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,260
Oh! Fallen for Sonoko-san, have you?!

684
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:48,660
Are you serious, Conan?!

685
00:46:48,702 --> 00:46:50,662
L-it's not like that...

686
00:46:54,374 --> 00:46:56,668
Maybe I should try that, too...

687
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:06,303
Inspector! We should go to the party, too!

688
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:13,185
No! Seeing as Tokiwa-san said no,
all we can do is wait here!

689
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:16,521
All we can do now is pray nothing happens...

690
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:29,093
Wow! Caviar, foie gras, duck!

691
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:31,369
This is too much!

692
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:35,248
- I think I'll have some, too!
- No. You'll have Japanese food.

693
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,251
I'll get you some low-calorie dishes.

694
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:42,339
She acts like a wife...

695
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,925
I'm always starving because of her.

696
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:47,761
This car's so cool!

697
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:50,388
It's a Ford Mustang convertible!

698
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:53,767
But how'd they get something so big in here?

699
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,771
They probably put it together in here.

700
00:47:57,813 --> 00:48:00,899
No, they used a freight elevator.

701
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:03,235
Freight elevator?

702
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:05,278
We have one in our apartment building!

703
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,007
It's bigger than normal ones,
so dressers are easy to handle!

704
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:10,784
Could it hold an elephant too, then?!

705
00:48:10,826 --> 00:48:12,953
I think so...

706
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:15,956
I don't think anyone has a pet elephant.

707
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:25,966
It's so pretty!

708
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:29,177
"If Shinichi were hereto see
this beautiful view with me,

709
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:31,763
I'd be in such bliss!"

710
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:32,889
Right?

711
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:35,267
Oh, whatever.

712
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:39,163
I had wanted Mt. Fuji to be
viewable from that building too,

713
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:42,858
but the constituents wouldn't allow it.

714
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:46,528
Oh, right. You can't see Mt. Fuji from Tower B.

715
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:58,915
Thank you all for attending this,
the grand opening party

716
00:48:58,957 --> 00:49:01,060
of the Twin Tower Building!

717
00:49:01,084 --> 00:49:04,838
I would like to start
things off with a little game.

718
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,884
A game that takes after the name
of my late father Tokiwa Kanenari

719
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:12,971
and the 30 years of the Tokiwa Group!

720
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:16,808
A 30-second guessing game!

721
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,477
Just like the one you thought up!

722
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,940
Whoever counts 30 seconds
exactly or gets the closest

723
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:31,573
will receive the Mustang
convertible on display there!

724
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:33,926
- Awesome!
- A car!

725
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,246
- It's a foreign convertible!
- That's so cool!

726
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:43,001
However, if there are two winners,
rock-paper-scissors will take place,

727
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:49,567
and the loser will have to
tolerate a mountain bike and a helmet!

728
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:52,570
- I'd rather have the mountain bike!
- Me too!

729
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:55,138
We can't drive cars!

730
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,911
- Alright, Mitsuhiko!
- We have Ayumi-chan with us!

731
00:49:59,935 --> 00:50:02,520
Victory is as good as ours!

732
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:05,190
Where could Conan-kun be?

733
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:09,861
I ask those of you playing the game
to let us hold on to your watches.

734
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,867
They'll be returned shortly with
gems that suit them perfectly!

735
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:19,537
Wow! Gems!

736
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:22,308
The Tokiwa zaibatsu doesn't mess around...

737
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:25,001
Here we are!

738
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:27,253
Take a flag if you put one in!

739
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:28,588
Here you are!

740
00:50:31,257 --> 00:50:33,319
- Here you are!
- No, I'm okay!

741
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,011
Same here.

742
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:39,158
I have no watch, nor any desire to play games.

743
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:42,811
Now, then! Could the children
please come up to the front!

744
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:51,820
Huh? Conan and Haibara aren't playing?

745
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,074
Now let's begin!

746
00:50:56,116 --> 00:51:02,038
Once you've counted 30 seconds
from her mark, raise your flag!

747
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,957
Bring it on!

748
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,292
Ready... Start!

749
00:51:12,132 --> 00:51:14,092
- A. 9.10.
- 15.16.

750
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,094
21.22.23.

751
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:22,201
- 7.8.9. - 8.9.10.
- 6... 7.8...

752
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:26,938
24.25.26.27-

753
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,315
Oh no! I lost count!

754
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:30,650
Here!

755
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:32,003
- Here!
- Here!

756
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:35,447
Uh oh! I'll have to go when someone else does!

757
00:51:35,488 --> 00:51:36,406
Here!

758
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:40,076
- Done!
- That blue flag there!

759
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:44,456
Congratulations! You're the grand prize winner!

760
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:46,082
Dad!

761
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:48,043
Are you serious?!

762
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:52,023
It's you, Mori-senpai! Come right up!

763
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,716
Excuse me!

764
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:58,362
Everyone! This is the great
detective, Mori Kogoro-san!

765
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:01,139
Could you say a little something?

766
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:04,809
Now I can say goodbye to the rental car life!

767
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:09,272
Oh, Dad...

768
00:52:09,314 --> 00:52:14,027
- I got it wrong...
- I was still on 25...

769
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:15,695
I was on 12.

770
00:52:22,035 --> 00:52:23,536
Great. Then I'd be delighted-

771
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:26,724
Excuse me. Kazama-san, if you would...

772
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:28,083
Excuse me.

773
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:39,177
And now, for the works of today's main guest,

774
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:48,019
our country's master Japanese-style painter,
Kisaragi Hohsui-sensei!

775
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:51,082
Kisaragi-sensei deeply loves Mt. Fuji,

776
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:55,568
and has painted its majestic
figure for over 30 years!

777
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,572
And this time, he's donated his
latest work to celebrate the opening

778
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:04,661
of the Twin Tower Building,
owned by his pupil, Tokiwa Mio!

779
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:08,331
I present to you, " Mt. Fuji in the Spring Snow"!

780
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:15,463
Is that-?!

781
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:16,798
What?!

782
00:53:21,094 --> 00:53:22,387
M-Ma'am!

783
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,474
Damn!

784
00:53:28,393 --> 00:53:31,062
Get her down! Lower Mio-kun down!

785
00:53:31,104 --> 00:53:32,790
And shut the curtains!

786
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:34,149
Right!

787
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,079
It's too late...

788
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,085
Piano wire in her pearl necklace?!

789
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:58,381
The piano wire leads up there?!

790
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:00,091
That's...

791
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,718
...an o-choko cup!

792
00:54:01,759 --> 00:54:03,720
Could it be?! Is this also...?!

793
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:07,515
Say what?! Tokiwa Mio-san?!

794
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:08,850
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

795
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:30,556
The picture of Mt. Fuji...

796
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:34,500
You can even see Fuji at night here.

797
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:37,629
So this is what she meant?

798
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:43,426
Basically, this piano wire hook
was attached to Mio-kun's necklace.

799
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:45,470
The wire went over the catwalk,

800
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:49,307
so when the painting was lowered,
she was pulled up.

801
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:52,477
I see. Who else was on the stage then?

802
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:55,188
Just me and Kisaragi-sensei.

803
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,565
Then please stand where you were.

804
00:54:57,607 --> 00:54:59,442
Chiba-kun, you stand where Tokiwa-san was.

805
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:00,420
Yes, sir.

806
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:03,738
These lights were our markers.
The middle was Mio-san's.

807
00:55:05,615 --> 00:55:07,700
I was over here.

808
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:10,703
Meanwhile, you were in the
stage wing, Sawaguchi-san?

809
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:14,874
Yes. I was in charge of lowering
and raising the painting...

810
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,876
And the pearl necklace?

811
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:21,714
She said it was a present from someone,
but I don't know who...

812
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:23,633
When was this picture brought here?

813
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:29,264
Last night. I brought it in here in
the presence of Kisaragi-sensei.

814
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:33,518
Meaning the piano wire
would've been most easily set by...

815
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,520
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

816
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:37,915
Come to think of it, Kisaragi-san.

817
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:41,192
I hear you were mad that
Mio-kun bought all your paintings up

818
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,736
and then sold them at high prices.

819
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:47,800
I hardly think that would be
cause to murder someone!

820
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:54,807
But, from what you said earlier,
this appears to be a serial murder...

821
00:55:54,831 --> 00:56:02,940
If so, seeing as I have an alibi
for the second murder, it can't be me.

822
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:06,551
We never showed
Kisaragi-san the last two o-choko cups,

823
00:56:06,592 --> 00:56:10,555
so he couldn't have known to
leave a similar one here to fool us.

824
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:12,390
Umm...

825
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:13,766
Just after the lights went out,

826
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:18,313
I did sense someone approach
Mio-san and say something.

827
00:56:18,354 --> 00:56:21,625
- Really?!
- Was it a man or a woman?!

828
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:25,278
I did get a quick whiff of perfume...

829
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,506
Yes! I was the one who talked to her!

830
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:32,327
But I only went to
double-check things with her...

831
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:33,411
Aha!

832
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:36,247
Inspector! I know who did it!

833
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:38,416
Eh?!

834
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:43,588
The killer is you, Sawaguchi Chinami-san!

835
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:46,424
N-No! How can you say that?!

836
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:48,259
Sawaguchi-san.

837
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:52,323
I'm told your father was a reporter
with a strong sense of justice,

838
00:56:52,347 --> 00:56:56,976
and that he was always chasing
after politicians' wrongdoings.

839
00:56:57,018 --> 00:57:00,331
After he died, you went to work for Tokiwa,

840
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:02,333
and became the president's secretary.

841
00:57:02,357 --> 00:57:05,401
However, during the construction
of the Twin Tower Building,

842
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:07,904
wrongdoings took place.

843
00:57:07,945 --> 00:57:12,408
Mio-kun and Hara-san got together,
handed Councilman Oki money,

844
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,454
and asked him to revise
the city building ordinance.

845
00:57:16,496 --> 00:57:20,792
Having inherited your father's
character, you couldn't forgive that.

846
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,628
So you killed all three of them!

847
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:26,631
N-No!

848
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:28,341
But, Mori-kun.

849
00:57:28,383 --> 00:57:31,344
I thought there weren't
any connections between her

850
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:34,406
and the o-choko cups left at each crime?

851
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:39,310
No, Inspector! "O-choko" is
written as " mouth of the boar"!

852
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:43,314
Sawaguchi-san was born
in the year of the " boar,"

853
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:46,734
and has " mouth" in her name!

854
00:57:46,776 --> 00:57:53,759
In short, she left the shattered
o-choko cups at the scenes as messages

855
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:57,995
of the crushing anger she
inherited from her father!

856
00:57:58,037 --> 00:58:00,724
Oh! Brilliant!

857
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:03,209
It all fits, and you're not even asleep!

858
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:11,610
That's nothing but a
skillfully-forced interpretation.

859
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:12,736
Say What?!

860
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,013
After all, this latest o-choko wasn't shattered!

861
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:18,349
If she wanted to express her crushing anger-

862
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:21,018
Shut up, you!

863
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:25,398
OWW!

864
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,400
You seem to be having a hard time.

865
00:58:27,442 --> 00:58:29,861
If you know something, say so!

866
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:31,446
I don't know.

867
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:36,367
All I can say is that Mio-san
must've been very drunk at the time.

868
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,785
Eh?

869
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:41,140
Otherwise, don't you think she
would've noticed when the piano wire

870
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,791
was hooked to her necklace?

871
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:53,986
A pearl! What's it doing here?!

872
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,929
Wait a minute! Could it be...?!

873
00:58:56,971 --> 00:59:00,057
Kazama-san! I didn't do anything! Right?!

874
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,644
No, it was too dark to see anything...

875
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:06,314
If that person is the killer, then...

876
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:26,459
Now I see! This was the motive!

877
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:29,128
But, if so, then that incident...

878
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:43,494
Ah! So that's what that meant!

879
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,436
I've figured it all out!

880
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:48,940
The whole picture of all
three mysterious incidents!

881
01:00:09,877 --> 01:00:11,837
W-What's that?!

882
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,808
- What's this shaking?!
- An earthquake?

883
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:26,811
What on earth is happening?!

884
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:28,604
"Explosions?!
- -What?!"

885
01:00:28,646 --> 01:00:29,522
Where at?!

886
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:34,586
The B4 electric room and
the 40th floor computer room!

887
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,988
- The computer room?!
- Eh?!

888
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:40,616
Kazama-san! Tokiwa's main computer is in there!

889
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:43,035
All our essential data will be destroyed!

890
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:45,913
A fire has also broken out
from the rear of the 40th floor!

891
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:48,499
Please evacuate the building immediately!

892
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:49,875
Right!

893
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:53,230
Inspector! It sounds like
we should evacuate at once!

894
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:58,092
If the electric room's blown up,
emergency power's been cut too!

895
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:00,553
Then the elevators don't work, either?!

896
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:01,780
No.

897
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:05,617
Wait! The observation elevator might work!

898
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:06,767
Really?!

899
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,770
It has a different power source
in case VIPs need to evacuate!

900
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:15,526
It works!

901
01:01:15,568 --> 01:01:17,987
- What's the maximum occupancy?
- 9 adults.

902
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:20,615
It'll take too long to get everyone out!

903
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:22,742
Are there any other escape routes?!

904
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:25,077
If you take the emergency
stairs down to the 60th floor,

905
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,265
you can cross the bridge to get into Tower B!

906
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:32,668
Okay! The women, children, and
elderly will take the elevator down!

907
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,671
Everyone else will take the emergency stairs!

908
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:00,738
What's the situation?!

909
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,701
The electric room exploded, and
the sprinklers and such don't work!

910
01:02:05,743 --> 01:02:07,953
- The fire doors?!
- Closed!

911
01:02:07,995 --> 01:02:10,915
Can we get to that bridge from Tower B?!

912
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:12,309
There's a direct elevator!

913
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:16,146
Alright! Teams A and B to the electric room!

914
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,131
Team C and I will cross the
bridge from the other building

915
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:20,591
and go to the 40th floor!

916
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:21,926
Yes, sir!

917
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:26,198
Go on, Conan-kun!

918
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:28,224
You get on first, Ran-neechan.

919
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:29,558
Just go!

920
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:34,730
Over the weight limit!

921
01:02:34,772 --> 01:02:35,773
Conan-kun!

922
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:38,651
I'll be fine! I'll take the next one!

923
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:40,653
Please go now!

924
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:46,117
The remaining women,
Conan-kun, and Kisaragi-san

925
01:02:46,158 --> 01:02:48,160
will take the next elevator down!

926
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:51,622
I will take the stairs.

927
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:54,750
But, aren't you...?

928
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,836
Don't treat me like a senior citizen!

929
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,630
Right! As you wish!

930
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:02,133
Alright, Kazama-san. Please go ahead.

931
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:08,264
Alright, everyone! I'll lead the way!
Please follow me!

932
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:12,935
Shiratori-kun, you guys go, too.
I'll catch up with you later.

933
01:03:12,977 --> 01:03:14,645
All right!

934
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,647
Doc, I hate to ask, but...

935
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,567
Alright. Got it.

936
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:25,114
Huh?

937
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,160
I'm sorry!

938
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:33,706
- Go ahead!
- But...

939
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:34,999
We'll be fine!

940
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,670
We'll use the bridge on the 60th
floor to go to the next building!

941
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:42,399
See you at the bottom!

942
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:45,402
Go on, now!

943
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:46,761
Thank you, children!

944
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:54,119
Oh no! It's pitch dark!
I can't tell where anything is!

945
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:59,315
Hey! Now what? We gave
them our Wristwatch Lights earlier...

946
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,902
Oh! This is bad!

947
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:07,299
Honestly, now. You should've
thought of that before getting off.

948
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:11,786
Oh, yeah! You and Conan-kun
didn't participate in the game!

949
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:13,430
Let's hurry, then!

950
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:18,125
Hold on. Can't we just
wait for the next elevator?

951
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:21,712
You're so dumb. The next one will be full, too.

952
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:24,381
In any case, let's hurry to the 60th floor!

953
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,703
Here we go!

954
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:08,759
The scale and timing of
these explosions were planned.

955
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:13,764
Could the men in black
have planted the bombs?!

956
01:05:13,806 --> 01:05:18,161
If so, I can imagine why they
blew up the computer room...

957
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:19,520
But why the electric room?

958
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:23,566
Get on, please!

959
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,446
You, too, Chinami-san.
We can talk in detail later.

960
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:30,781
All right.

961
01:05:47,506 --> 01:05:52,469
To keep the sprinklers from
activating? Or some other purpose?

962
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:56,974
Good thing this elevator
has its own power source!

963
01:05:57,016 --> 01:06:00,311
Otherwise, we'd have to
go down all those stairs!

964
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:03,647
C-Could it be?!

965
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:14,158
Gin!

966
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:33,761
Rest in peace, Sherry!

967
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,099
Sonoko-neechan! Your panties are showing!

968
01:06:45,189 --> 01:06:47,983
What?! What?! Why are we stopped?!

969
01:06:51,195 --> 01:06:54,156
It's someone else?

970
01:06:54,198 --> 01:06:58,494
The laser point is gone!
Did he realize it's the wrong person?!

971
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,550
It's no use! It won't move!

972
01:07:13,592 --> 01:07:15,886
- Ran-neechan! Lift me on your shoulders!
- Eh?! Right!

973
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,148
There you go!

974
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:32,653
Conan-kun! Let me do it!

975
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:40,577
You can do it, Ran-neechan!

976
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:41,912
Please!

977
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:48,252
Way to go, Ran!

978
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:05,662
- What floor is this?
- The 45th.

979
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:08,313
This floor has a bridge!

980
01:08:08,355 --> 01:08:09,982
Oh no! Smoke!

981
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:15,112
Let's run across the bridge
to the next building!

982
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:22,995
It's me. Any luck there?

983
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:28,000
No, only the men are coming across.

984
01:08:31,462 --> 01:08:35,025
She probably stayed up above
after realizing what we're after,

985
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:38,069
but she won't get away.

986
01:08:38,093 --> 01:08:40,012
Drop the bridges!

987
01:08:40,054 --> 01:08:43,015
Everyone! We can cross to
the next building from here!

988
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:54,359
Look! There's the bridge!

989
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:06,371
Look out, Conan-kun!

990
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:23,013
- What happened?!
- The bridges just fell!

991
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:25,617
Mori-san! The observation elevator is stopped!

992
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:26,934
What?!

993
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:30,354
Ran!

994
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:41,573
Ran! Are you alright?!

995
01:09:41,615 --> 01:09:45,369
We're okay!

996
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,263
What do we do now, Conan-kun?

997
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:50,040
This is bad! Our escape routes are cut off!

998
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:50,707
Eh?!

999
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,709
The other side of the fire
door is filled with smoke!

1000
01:09:57,214 --> 01:09:58,173
No...

1001
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:05,389
Now what?

1002
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:09,184
The battery ran out.

1003
01:10:09,226 --> 01:10:13,188
It's dangerous to move about recklessly.
Let's wait here for help.

1004
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:18,569
Are you all right, Conan-kun?

1005
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:35,169
Ran-neechan! You're not thinking of...?!

1006
01:10:36,378 --> 01:10:39,339
I don't know if it'll work
like in the movies, but...

1007
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:43,552
Hold on tight, Conan-kun!

1008
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:53,562
Oh! It's Ran-san!

1009
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:55,564
What?! Gimme those!

1010
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:01,153
W-What is she planning to do?!

1011
01:11:15,334 --> 01:11:18,521
Ran-neechan, you're not scared?

1012
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:20,547
I'm scared!

1013
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:26,553
But you're with me,
and Shinichi told me to wait for him...

1014
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:31,850
I have to live so I can wait for him...

1015
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:41,235
Conan-kun, I'm...

1016
01:11:41,276 --> 01:11:44,589
It'll be okay, Ran-neechan!

1017
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:47,908
I know how you feel, so much that it hurts...

1018
01:12:24,403 --> 01:12:26,363
Oh no! The hose is on fire!

1019
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,568
Are you okay, Conan-kun?!

1020
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:50,595
Y-Yeah! You're awesome, Ran-neechan!

1021
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:56,393
Mori-san!

1022
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:01,565
Ran!

1023
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:05,235
- Sonoko!
- Thank goodness you're alright!

1024
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,237
Geez! Just had to act crazy!

1025
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:13,952
Look out!

1026
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:18,915
Look! The observation elevator!

1027
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:26,506
Doc! Where is that person?!

1028
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:30,260
Eh? Oh, sorry! I lost sight of them!

1029
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:33,263
And I don't see the children, either!

1030
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:34,598
What?!

1031
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,268
Ayumi! Genta! Mitsuhiko! Do you read me?!

1032
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:42,332
We read you, Conan-kun!

1033
01:13:42,356 --> 01:13:44,316
Where are you?!

1034
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:48,379
Actually, right in front
of the 60th floor bridge...

1035
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:49,696
What?!

1036
01:13:51,907 --> 01:13:53,950
They're up there?!

1037
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:56,453
Takagi-kun! Call an emergency helicopter!

1038
01:13:56,495 --> 01:13:57,788
Y-Yes, sir!

1039
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:22,437
Mister! I'm borrowing your flashlight!

1040
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:23,772
Little boy! Stop!

1041
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:28,044
What the-?!

1042
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:30,487
- That sound!
- it's his skateboard!

1043
01:14:30,529 --> 01:14:31,822
Conan?!

1044
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:46,503
OWW!

1045
01:14:46,545 --> 01:14:47,838
You're awesome!

1046
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:49,381
You're so cool!

1047
01:14:49,423 --> 01:14:51,425
You're our savior!

1048
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:55,429
Geez! This is no time to be impressed!

1049
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:58,890
What the-?!

1050
01:14:58,932 --> 01:15:01,435
Conan-kun's skateboard!

1051
01:15:01,476 --> 01:15:04,855
Conan-kun just jumped
across the 60th floor bridge!

1052
01:15:04,896 --> 01:15:06,189
What?!

1053
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:09,526
Megure!

1054
01:15:09,568 --> 01:15:12,362
Inspector! We're going up to the top!

1055
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:13,905
Have the chopper land on the roof!

1056
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:15,907
"We"?! Where are you?!

1057
01:15:23,832 --> 01:15:26,877
Going up 15 floors is tough...

1058
01:15:26,918 --> 01:15:29,796
Hang in there, Genta-kun! We're almost there!

1059
01:15:29,838 --> 01:15:31,131
Y-Yeah...

1060
01:15:34,718 --> 01:15:36,612
You guys go on ahead.

1061
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:38,972
Eh? Where are you going, Conan-kun?

1062
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:46,104
Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

1063
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:49,024
What's the deal?

1064
01:15:49,065 --> 01:15:52,170
You know how Conan-kun is!
He must have an idea!

1065
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:54,488
Let's go on up to the roof!

1066
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:58,158
L-Let me think for a second!

1067
01:16:10,837 --> 01:16:12,088
Someone's in here!

1068
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,758
The person who murdered Oki-san and Mio-san.

1069
01:16:18,803 --> 01:16:21,866
He decided to kill Mio-san for a certain reason,

1070
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:24,869
so he gave her a pearl necklace as a present.

1071
01:16:24,893 --> 01:16:27,854
He told her to wear the
necklace at the opening party

1072
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:31,209
and show the painting he
gave as a gift to her on stage.

1073
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:33,193
Then the killer is...!

1074
01:16:36,696 --> 01:16:39,658
Yes. Mio-san's Japanese painting instructor...

1075
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,120
...Kisaragi Hohsui-san!

1076
01:16:56,841 --> 01:16:58,635
As I recall, you're...

1077
01:16:58,677 --> 01:17:02,556
...Edogawa Conan. A detective.

1078
01:17:02,597 --> 01:17:09,145
The necklace you gave Mio-san
was made to come undone easily.

1079
01:17:09,187 --> 01:17:14,526
And you had prepared another necklace.

1080
01:17:14,568 --> 01:17:18,488
During the party, you took that necklace out,

1081
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,490
and hooked it to the piano wire hook

1082
01:17:20,532 --> 01:17:25,555
hanging from the painting of Mt. Fuji
and hidden along a curtain fold.

1083
01:17:25,579 --> 01:17:29,499
Next, using the light on the floor,
you walked up to Mio-san

1084
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,228
and undid her necklace.

1085
01:17:32,252 --> 01:17:37,632
To the flustered Mio-san,
you said, " It's okay. I'll get it for you."

1086
01:17:37,674 --> 01:17:40,736
and then you put the other
necklace around her neck...

1087
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,514
...the piano wire necklace.

1088
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:45,181
In other words-

1089
01:17:45,223 --> 01:17:49,185
The hook wasn't attached to Mio-san's necklace.

1090
01:17:49,227 --> 01:17:52,897
The necklace had a hook on it from the start.

1091
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:55,859
That's why she never noticed it.

1092
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:02,782
This pearl I picked up fell off
when you took the first necklace off.

1093
01:18:02,824 --> 01:18:06,202
The o-choko cup on the stage
was purposely left there

1094
01:18:06,244 --> 01:18:07,954
to make it look like a serial murder.

1095
01:18:07,996 --> 01:18:12,542
Hold on. Kisaragi-san has
an alibi for Hara-san's murder.

1096
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:17,547
Of course he does.
Because someone else murdered Hara-san.

1097
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,578
The fire's reached the 70th floor!

1098
01:18:30,602 --> 01:18:32,937
Come on! Where's that emergency chopper?!

1099
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,981
I'll check, sir!

1100
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:36,316
Conan-kun. ..

1101
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:40,153
That night, after we left,

1102
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:44,324
you went to Hara-san's apartment to kill him.

1103
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,242
But...

1104
01:18:46,284 --> 01:18:50,348
...Hara-san was already dead, shot in the chest.

1105
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:54,250
Thinking quickly,
you disguised it as a serial murder,

1106
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:57,879
in order to create an alibi for yourself.

1107
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:01,317
Because with serial murders,
if you have an alibi for one incident,

1108
01:19:01,341 --> 01:19:03,927
you're no longer a suspect.

1109
01:19:03,968 --> 01:19:09,140
So you broke your o-choko cup there,
just like with Oki-san.

1110
01:19:09,182 --> 01:19:13,603
When you did, some of the
fragments fell on the dried blood.

1111
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:19,835
That's why none of the fragments
in Tome-san's bag had blood.

1112
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:24,239
And, in the photo from the scene
of Oki-san's murder in the hotel,

1113
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,076
only the lower part of the
closet was covered in blood.

1114
01:19:28,118 --> 01:19:33,081
It was probably because a wall scroll
you painted was hanging there.

1115
01:19:33,123 --> 01:19:38,229
You gave Oki-san that wall scroll
as a pretense to visit his room

1116
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,630
and catch him off guard.

1117
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:44,676
That's quite the interesting theory,
little detective.

1118
01:19:44,718 --> 01:19:46,678
But your theory has no-

1119
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,681
I do have proof. Right inside that cane.

1120
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:58,189
The first necklace Mio-san was
wearing should be hidden inside!

1121
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:15,373
How did you know I hid it in here?

1122
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:16,726
The sound.

1123
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:22,398
The sound of the cane slightly
differed before and after Mio-san died.

1124
01:20:22,422 --> 01:20:24,382
Truly the ears of a detective.

1125
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,265
Oh! Here it comes!

1126
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:42,150
But what was his motive?

1127
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:45,755
Because Mio-san bought all his
paintings and sold them for a lot?

1128
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:50,867
No. His motive was most
likely the Twin Tower Building.

1129
01:20:50,909 --> 01:20:55,747
As for the reason you killed
Oki-san and tried to kill Hara-san...

1130
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:59,209
At some point, all of your Mt. Fuji paintings

1131
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,772
were of the same angle and composition.

1132
01:21:02,796 --> 01:21:05,381
You painted them from the same location, yes?

1133
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:14,390
From a small hill I found on
the outskirts of West Tama City.

1134
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:19,729
For decades, I visited
that hill to do my paintings.

1135
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:24,943
But as I grew older, climbing
the hill became more difficult.

1136
01:21:24,984 --> 01:21:30,865
So, three years ago, I bought the
entire hill and built a house there

1137
01:21:30,907 --> 01:21:34,077
so I could paint Mt. Fuji
for the rest of my life.

1138
01:21:34,118 --> 01:21:39,874
I built my workroom in the very best spot.

1139
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:47,048
From that window,
I had a grand view of Mt. Fuji.

1140
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:50,385
And then that woman destroyed it!

1141
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:05,775
Then, does that mean those
broken cups represented Mt. Fuji?

1142
01:22:05,817 --> 01:22:07,777
Yeah. They were his messages of anger

1143
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:11,906
that the Twin Tower Building
had split Mt. Fuji in two.

1144
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:16,244
But the cup wasn't broken
when Mio-san was killed!

1145
01:22:16,286 --> 01:22:19,831
That was left to make it
look like a serial murder,

1146
01:22:19,873 --> 01:22:22,792
and there was no reason
to leave the message there.

1147
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:27,922
Because Mio-san had already
split the painting of Mt. Fuji in two.

1148
01:22:27,964 --> 01:22:31,068
Seeing as the necklace
evidence has been discovered,

1149
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:34,053
I won't be able to talk my way out of this.

1150
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:52,447
Sorry. As a detective, I can't allow you to die.

1151
01:22:55,992 --> 01:22:58,953
Hey! Down here!

1152
01:22:59,913 --> 01:23:04,417
How did you figure out
Kisaragi Hohsui's motive?

1153
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:08,504
It'd been bugging me ever
since we went to his house.

1154
01:23:08,546 --> 01:23:10,858
When we arrived at Asahino Station,

1155
01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:15,279
I saw the Twin Tower Building
split Mt. Fuji behind Mitsuhiko.

1156
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:19,265
And Kisaragi-san's house was
in the exact opposite direction.

1157
01:23:19,307 --> 01:23:24,437
But the large window in his
workroom was covered by curtains.

1158
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:30,878
So he didn't want people to see
his view of Mt. Fuji was obstructed...

1159
01:23:30,902 --> 01:23:34,989
- But there's one other thing.
- Hara-san's killer, right?

1160
01:23:35,031 --> 01:23:40,095
This is only conjecture,
but he was holding a silver knife.

1161
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:43,623
In Japanese, silver is " gin."

1162
01:23:43,665 --> 01:23:45,124
Look.

1163
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:50,272
When " gin" is on a liquor bottle,
it's pronounced differently.

1164
01:23:50,296 --> 01:23:51,631
Gin!

1165
01:23:55,593 --> 01:23:59,222
Gin most likely had a gun pointed at Hara-san,

1166
01:23:59,263 --> 01:24:03,059
who quickly picked up a knife on the table.

1167
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:07,313
Even Gin would've assumed he
was going to use it to put up a fight...

1168
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:10,900
...never realizing it was actually a message.

1169
01:24:10,942 --> 01:24:13,027
Hara-san was working with them?

1170
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:19,367
Yeah. He probably broke into
their computers and stole secret data.

1171
01:24:19,409 --> 01:24:23,913
That's why they killed him,
deleted all of his computer data,

1172
01:24:23,955 --> 01:24:31,295
and blew up the Tokiwa main computer,
where he may have copied it.

1173
01:24:31,337 --> 01:24:35,133
So that's what happened...

1174
01:24:35,174 --> 01:24:37,593
Oh no! The battery ran out!

1175
01:24:37,635 --> 01:24:40,948
I'll go up and get someone
to help carry Kisaragi-san!

1176
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:42,432
You wait here!

1177
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:15,631
- Yay!
- We're saved!

1178
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:18,634
There's no wind! It should be all right now!

1179
01:25:35,068 --> 01:25:37,361
Come back, guys! Hurry!

1180
01:25:46,412 --> 01:25:48,748
W-Who would do this?!

1181
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:54,337
That should keep the helicopter away.

1182
01:25:54,378 --> 01:26:00,093
Even if they wait around
for the fire to stop, it'll still be...

1183
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:01,427
...time up.

1184
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:05,389
I'm pooped...

1185
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:12,772
What's going on with this building?!

1186
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:16,275
We'll just have to wait for
the fire on the roof to stop now.

1187
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:18,611
I don't think we'll have the time for that.

1188
01:26:25,076 --> 01:26:26,369
A bomb?!

1189
01:26:27,495 --> 01:26:30,456
They're under all the tables. The timer is...

1190
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:37,338
Only four minutes left!

1191
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,675
Damn! They're going to
blow up the party room last

1192
01:26:40,716 --> 01:26:43,010
so it's not clear who they were after!

1193
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:57,483
Ran...

1194
01:26:57,525 --> 01:26:58,818
Hurry!

1195
01:27:08,161 --> 01:27:09,787
Captain! They're not reaching!

1196
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:12,081
Damn! It's no good!

1197
01:27:12,123 --> 01:27:14,750
Wait a minute! That roof!

1198
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:25,595
Yes! The key's here!

1199
01:27:25,636 --> 01:27:29,432
I get it! We're going to use this
car to jump to the next building!

1200
01:27:29,473 --> 01:27:31,100
It won't work.

1201
01:27:31,142 --> 01:27:37,440
The buildings are 50 meters apart.
60 if we're jumping across.

1202
01:27:37,481 --> 01:27:40,735
There's a 20 meter height
difference with the other building.

1203
01:27:40,776 --> 01:27:45,716
On Earth, an object can
move horizontally at one speed,

1204
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:51,537
but due to gravity, it will increase
vertical velocity at a specific rate.

1205
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:54,850
The equation for a 20-meter fall

1206
01:27:54,874 --> 01:27:58,127
is t equals the square root of 2s over g.

1207
01:27:58,169 --> 01:27:59,712
T being the time,

1208
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:05,176
g the acceleration due to gravity,
or 9.80665 m/s per second.

1209
01:28:05,218 --> 01:28:07,803
S is the distance fallen: 20 meters.

1210
01:28:07,845 --> 01:28:12,683
Plug these numbers in,
and you get 2.02 seconds.

1211
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:16,562
In other words, it would take
about 2 seconds to fall 20 meters.

1212
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:20,358
We have to travel 60 meters
in 2 seconds. Meaning...

1213
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:25,321
...30 meters in 1 second,
or 108 kilometers per hour.

1214
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:29,825
Given this room's size, we can
get up to 50 or 60 kph at most.

1215
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:34,747
We'd plummet before
reaching the other building...

1216
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:36,582
...but what if we did this?

1217
01:28:36,624 --> 01:28:39,335
Y-You're not thinking of going with the blast?!

1218
01:28:39,377 --> 01:28:42,213
Huh? What?! What're you talking about?!

1219
01:28:42,255 --> 01:28:47,176
Conan-kun is thinking of using the blast
from the explosion to fly further out!

1220
01:28:47,218 --> 01:28:49,262
What?!

1221
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:52,265
We're gonna die if we wait anyway!

1222
01:28:52,306 --> 01:28:53,599
Let's do it!

1223
01:28:56,686 --> 01:28:58,914
- Let's do it, Conan-kun!
- Let's do it!

1224
01:28:58,938 --> 01:29:00,856
Let's do it super-flashy!

1225
01:29:00,898 --> 01:29:04,193
The key to success will be in the timing.

1226
01:29:04,235 --> 01:29:09,198
The bombs have to go off just as
the car breaks through the window

1227
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,243
or it'll lose speed and plummet straight down.

1228
01:29:12,285 --> 01:29:16,872
Yeah. The problem is you
can't see the timer from the car.

1229
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:20,477
My watch's battery ran out, too...

1230
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,837
In that case, we have Ayumi-chan!

1231
01:29:22,878 --> 01:29:25,840
She might be able to count 30 seconds exactly!

1232
01:29:25,881 --> 01:29:28,443
But she got it wrong just a while ago...

1233
01:29:28,467 --> 01:29:30,303
Oh.

1234
01:29:30,344 --> 01:29:32,471
What do you think, Ayumi-chan? Can you do it?

1235
01:29:32,513 --> 01:29:37,286
L-I'm not very confident, but...
if you're with me, Conan-kun-!

1236
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:38,686
Eh?!

1237
01:29:38,728 --> 01:29:43,232
I think I can do it, if you're by my side!

1238
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:44,567
Ayumi...

1239
01:29:48,404 --> 01:29:52,968
In that case, how about I stay by
the timer and count until 30 seconds

1240
01:29:52,992 --> 01:29:56,579
and then get in the car?

1241
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,749
There's no time to think! Let's go with that!

1242
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:03,544
What?! There are bombs in the party room?!

1243
01:30:03,586 --> 01:30:05,880
Have them open the dome roof right away!

1244
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:08,608
- The roof?!
- Just hurry!

1245
01:30:08,632 --> 01:30:09,967
Kazama-san!

1246
01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:16,599
Hello?! It's me! Open the dome
roof immediately! Right away!

1247
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,933
Pardon me!

1248
01:30:17,975 --> 01:30:20,787
What are you doing, Conan-kun?!

1249
01:30:20,811 --> 01:30:24,333
Ran-neechan, I'm coming there now.

1250
01:30:24,357 --> 01:30:26,692
"Just hurry!
"Hello?! Conan-kun?!

1251
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:35,659
Alright!

1252
01:30:51,342 --> 01:30:53,386
55.54.

1253
01:30:53,427 --> 01:30:54,887
53.52.

1254
01:30:54,929 --> 01:30:57,306
51.50.

1255
01:30:57,348 --> 01:30:58,641
49.48.

1256
01:30:58,682 --> 01:31:01,602
47.46.45.

1257
01:31:01,644 --> 01:31:03,521
44.43.

1258
01:31:03,562 --> 01:31:05,540
42.41.

1259
01:31:05,564 --> 01:31:08,567
40.39.38.

1260
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:10,528
37.36.

1261
01:31:10,569 --> 01:31:13,572
35.34.33.

1262
01:31:13,614 --> 01:31:15,616
32.31.

1263
01:31:15,658 --> 01:31:16,617
30!

1264
01:31:16,659 --> 01:31:17,427
29!

1265
01:31:17,451 --> 01:31:18,327
28!

1266
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:19,453
Haibara-san!

1267
01:31:19,495 --> 01:31:20,538
What's going on?!

1268
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:23,624
It's Haibara-san! She won't stop counting!

1269
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:24,625
What?!

1270
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:27,545
Haibara! What're you doing?! Get over here!

1271
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:30,923
Don't be dumb. This way is more accurate.

1272
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:34,403
Don't tell me she's planning to
stay behind and sacrifice herself?!

1273
01:31:34,427 --> 01:31:35,404
21!

1274
01:31:35,428 --> 01:31:36,762
20!

1275
01:31:43,394 --> 01:31:44,103
What are you doing?!

1276
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:49,400
My mom said it's bad luck to
waste even one grain of rice!

1277
01:31:49,442 --> 01:31:50,526
11!

1278
01:31:50,568 --> 01:31:51,527
10!

1279
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:52,796
9! 8!

1280
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:54,363
- Here!
- 7!

1281
01:31:54,405 --> 01:31:56,365
- 6! 5!
- Here we go!

1282
01:31:56,407 --> 01:31:57,366
4!

1283
01:31:57,408 --> 01:31:58,367
B!

1284
01:31:58,409 --> 01:31:59,368
2!

1285
01:31:59,410 --> 01:31:59,929
1!

1286
01:31:59,953 --> 01:32:01,287
0!

1287
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:10,004
Haibara-san!

1288
01:32:12,673 --> 01:32:15,301
I absolutely won't let go!

1289
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:20,639
Oh no! At this rate,
she'll run into those pillars!

1290
01:32:22,016 --> 01:32:23,976
I'm borrowing this!

1291
01:32:54,089 --> 01:32:55,382
Conan-kun!

1292
01:32:58,177 --> 01:32:59,595
Ran-neechan!

1293
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:00,763
We're okay!

1294
01:33:00,804 --> 01:33:02,097
Yay!

1295
01:33:05,851 --> 01:33:08,979
Say, Conan-kun! Where did you learn to drive?!

1296
01:33:09,021 --> 01:33:10,981
My old man taught me in Hawaii-

1297
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:24,203
Boss, there were five kids
and an old man in the car.

1298
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:28,582
It appears she never came to the party.

1299
01:33:28,624 --> 01:33:32,461
No matter.
We accomplished our original objective.

1300
01:33:32,503 --> 01:33:37,007
Yes. But to think he'd betray us

1301
01:33:37,049 --> 01:33:41,530
and sneak into the organization's computers...

1302
01:33:41,554 --> 01:33:43,556
Got it, boss!

1303
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:47,077
The Twin Tower Building in
West Tama City's where the hacker is!

1304
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:49,520
It must be Hara's doing after all.

1305
01:33:49,562 --> 01:33:54,483
We took care of Hara,
and blew up Tokiwa's main computer.

1306
01:33:54,525 --> 01:33:57,486
The organization's
information won't leak outside now.

1307
01:34:01,782 --> 01:34:06,829
I had hoped to use that
building as her execution grounds,

1308
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:08,831
but I'll save that fun for another time.

1309
01:34:27,099 --> 01:34:29,852
I can't believe
Kisaragi-san was behind it all...

1310
01:34:29,893 --> 01:34:31,538
It's a shock...

1311
01:34:31,562 --> 01:34:35,816
You think? I suspected him from the very start!

1312
01:34:35,858 --> 01:34:38,878
This is probably as far as
the police will investigate.

1313
01:34:38,902 --> 01:34:44,575
Yeah. They'll likely never find
out Gin murdered Hara-san, either.

1314
01:34:44,617 --> 01:34:47,578
And the truth about the
bombing will remain in the dark...

1315
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:56,920
Thank you for earlier. You saved me.

1316
01:34:56,962 --> 01:35:00,609
No, I only did my duty as a man!

1317
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:04,094
You too, Kojima-kun.
So I'm the same as a grain of rice?

1318
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:12,311
Still, Ayumi! How did you
get 30 seconds exactly again?!

1319
01:35:12,353 --> 01:35:13,646
Just luck!

1320
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:21,153
The truth is, it's thanks to you, Conan-kun!

1321
01:35:21,195 --> 01:35:23,572
When you're by my side, I get excited

1322
01:35:23,614 --> 01:35:26,575
and I can count time using my heartbeat!

1323
01:35:26,617 --> 01:35:29,846
Come to think of it, the first
time you counted 30 seconds...

1324
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:33,040
28! 29! 30!

1325
01:35:33,082 --> 01:35:36,210
So that's why you wanted me with you...

1326
01:35:36,251 --> 01:35:38,712
You were so cool, Mitsuhiko-kun!

1327
01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:39,672
Oh, uhh...

1328
01:35:39,713 --> 01:35:41,090
You too, Genta-kun!

1329
01:35:41,131 --> 01:35:42,174
Yeah?!

1330
01:35:42,216 --> 01:35:46,655
- Hey! What're you gonna do now?
- What do you mean?!

1331
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:50,367
If you make Yoshida-san cry,
I'll make you regret it!

1332
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:51,684
Hey, now!

1333
01:36:08,367 --> 01:36:13,789
It's not too late yet, it won't be a waste

1334
01:36:13,831 --> 01:36:23,858
Come on, let's just do what
we can, the way we planned

1335
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:30,907
Until I met you, I had nothing,

1336
01:36:30,931 --> 01:36:33,475
but I would close my eyes and think

1337
01:36:33,517 --> 01:36:38,355
because we have a place where we live together

1338
01:36:38,397 --> 01:36:44,820
Always have love in your heart and be brave

1339
01:36:44,862 --> 01:36:49,450
even if it doesn't work out

1340
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:54,848
No, that's not all you are

1341
01:36:54,872 --> 01:37:01,545
Yes, now that the wind has
changed direction, let's take flight

1342
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:16,059
It's a dream, but you don't give up

1343
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:20,981
You don't until the very end

1344
01:37:21,023 --> 01:37:26,403
No one ever realizes it at first

1345
01:37:26,445 --> 01:37:31,033
but they always reach that point

1346
01:37:31,074 --> 01:37:36,079
There's hope in your heart,

1347
01:37:36,121 --> 01:37:40,977
so your wishes will come
true when you're hurting

1348
01:37:41,001 --> 01:37:47,424
Always believe that and take a good look

1349
01:37:47,466 --> 01:37:52,012
even if it's painful

1350
01:37:52,054 --> 01:37:57,267
No, that's not all you are

1351
01:37:57,309 --> 01:38:03,941
Yes, this single moment will be you tomorrow

1352
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:19,915
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose, it doesn't matter

1353
01:38:24,294 --> 01:38:26,981
You make mistakes, but for a reason

1354
01:38:27,005 --> 01:38:28,983
There's a chance to be won

1355
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:31,027
God bless you for being yourself

1356
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:34,012
Sometimes life is so beautiful, yeah

1357
01:38:34,054 --> 01:38:39,268
Always give my love, always give my love to you

1358
01:38:39,309 --> 01:38:47,001
Always give my love, always give my love to you

1359
01:38:47,025 --> 01:38:49,945
Always give my love to you

1360
01:38:49,987 --> 01:38:56,952
Always give my, give my love

1361
01:39:03,834 --> 01:39:06,837
Hey, wait! Don't tell me this car is-?!

1362
01:39:06,879 --> 01:39:11,842
That's right! The Mustang
convertible you won as a prize!

1363
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:15,804
My dream car...

1364
01:39:23,395 --> 01:39:27,357
No, wait! Maybe it could be
usable again if I dry it out!
