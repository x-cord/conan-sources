00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:21,896
Marutakeebisuni Oshioike

2
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:27,476
Rokakku Bride..Takonishiki

3
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:32,706
Shiayabttakamatu
Wan five units

4
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:37,516
The snow shoes..
ding-ding-dong-dong

5
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:42,756
Passing through the 6th
and the 7th..and the 8th

6
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:47,956
You'll get to the Tonsi Avenue

7
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:52,966
And the final one
is the ninth avenue

8
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:10,056
Detective Conan
Crossroad in the Ancient Capital

9
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:18,156
I am a high school student
Kudo Shinichi

10
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,426
When I went to the amusement park

11
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,196
with my childhood friend
Mouri Ran

12
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:25,826
I witnessed an illegal deal

13
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,066
I just paid attention
to the deal

14
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:32,336
but ignored an accomplice
coming from my back

15
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:36,116
I was forced to drink the poison

16
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,406
After I woke up

17
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,176
My body shrank

18
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:43,546
If they know Kudo Shinichi
is still alive

19
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,916
I will be in danger

20
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,146
and moreover..
my loved ones will be affected

21
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:48,586
Under Dr. Agasa's suggestion

22
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,596
I have to disguise myself

23
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,056
When Ran asked my name

24
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,726
Without a second thought
I told her I am Edogawa Conan

25
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,456
In order to gather information
about those guys

26
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,596
I moved into Ran's place
Her father is a detective

27
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:15,046
I am Hattori Heiji
a high school detective in Kansai

28
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,516
My reasoning
and skill of martial arts

29
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:20,216
were passed on to me
from my father

30
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:24,086
And I inherited my boldness
from my mom

31
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:27,836
My dark skin complexion
came from my grandfather

32
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:31,706
There's saying..
Hattori in the west, Kudo in the east

33
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,236
We are equally popular

34
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,436
But Kudo is really outstanding

35
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:43,206
Using the strange machines
invented by Dr. Agasa

36
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:48,316
He has broken many cases

37
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:50,616
Besides the doctor and me..

38
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,656
there're other people
knowing his real identity

39
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:54,986
Kudo's father and mother

40
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:58,786
And Kudo's classmate
Haibara Ai

41
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,696
This kid..

42
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,326
He used to be the partner
of the man in black

43
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,336
But after he got out
of the organization

44
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,876
She was forced to drink
the poison

45
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,066
so her body shrank too

46
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:14,276
I have a childhood partner

47
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:18,046
She's Tooyama Kazuha
a nagging woman

48
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:20,746
Who's nagging?

49
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:22,246
Hey

50
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,826
Don't show up without any notice
Pighead

51
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:25,256
You are the pighead

52
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:26,946
Who are you talking to?

53
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:28,026
Come on

54
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:31,066
I'm explaining to the audience

55
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,186
Right?

56
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,026
Are you crazy?

57
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,756
You are crazy!

58
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,866
Your body shrank
but your brain did not

59
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,236
There's only one truth

60
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,806
Here we're at Beika Station
The exit is..

61
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,036
So you can't come back
temporarily

62
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,546
See..
I'm working on a case

63
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:55,616
Got it

64
00:03:56,586 --> 00:04:00,816
It's pretty cold lately..
You have to take care

65
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:03,286
Same to you..
Don't forget to cover the belly

66
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:07,126
That has never happened to me
idiot

67
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,896
Yoshinoyama

68
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:13,596
Stepping on the white snow
in the mountains

69
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,036
in order to look for
any living signs

70
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:18,936
You are not Yoshitune
and Shizuka Gozen

71
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,306
What's wrong?

72
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,936
You are worried about
your childhood friend?

73
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:26,376
My father is being nagging now
I gotta go

74
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:28,376
Ah..hey

75
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,016
Come on

76
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:33,316
I have to call
when he's not there next time

77
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,586
Yoshitune and Shizuka Gozen

78
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:41,156
Haven't they met each other
after the departure?

79
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:42,836
Hey..hey

80
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,426
(Tokyo Nishikunitati)

81
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,636
(Kamei no Rokurou)

82
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,536
(Kataoka no Hatirou)

83
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,546
(Washinoo no Shitirou)

84
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,586
Benkei is so slow

85
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:16,026
Right..he claims that
he has solved the problem

86
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,466
Because that guy is very interested
in this

87
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,406
Kataoka

88
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:01,336
(Osaka, during the night)

89
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,176
(Neyagawa City, Takohei)

90
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,686
(Bizen no Heishirou)

91
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,826
(Kyoto, during the dawn)

92
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,426
(Tosan District, Zirou Bar)

93
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,626
(Suruga no Zirou)

94
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:42,946
According to the investigation

95
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,786
The five victims murdered
in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto

96
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:51,556
used to be the members
of the robbery ring, Genzihotaru

97
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,326
As to this incident..

98
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,596
Satou

99
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:58,396
They say Captain Aynokouzi
in Kyoto Police Precinct

100
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,866
used to be the Shiratori's classmate

101
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:01,996
Yes

102
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:04,666
As the descendant of an imperial
minister he is nicknamed Captain Royalty

103
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:07,206
Look at his left pocket

104
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,406
What is that?

105
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,276
That is his pet, a squirrel

106
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,546
He always carries it
no matter where he goes

107
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,186
He's weirder than Shiratori

108
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:20,456
Starting from the year of 1991

109
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,926
Genzihotaru has been stealing
famous Buddhist statues or artifacts

110
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:26,896
around Tokyo, Kyoto,
and Osaka areas

111
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:32,126
They call each other by the name
of the servants in the Yoshitune's

112
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,006
Every one of them
has a Yoshitune Book

113
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:38,966
Yoshitune is the leader

114
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:43,476
There are totally 8 members
including Benkei and Ise no Saburou

115
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,876
Five of them have been killed

116
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,856
and their Yoshitune Books
have been taken away

117
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,516
Do you have any clues?

118
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:54,986
We only know the murder
is good at sword craft and using arrows

119
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:58,686
As to Yoshitune, Benkei,
and Ise no Saburou

120
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:02,096
We don't know their age or gender..

121
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:03,596
However

122
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:09,436
In order to round up
the other accomplices

123
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,206
We'll do our best
in the investigation

124
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:16,436
(Hattori's Residence)

125
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,616
Yoshitune is the leader
of the robbery ring

126
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,176
Heiji, are you there?

127
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:58,446
Come on

128
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,556
Isn't this very important?

129
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,886
Yes..

130
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:03,496
I have to keep it

131
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,656
Heiji..are you going out?

132
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,896
Yes..I need to check out something

133
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,656
How can I help you?

134
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:17,066
I'd like to invite you to appreciate
cherry blossoms in Tomorogi

135
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:18,176
But..forget about it

136
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:19,176
Really?

137
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,176
I gotta go

138
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:23,876
Take care then

139
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:24,816
Oh

140
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,386
Why do I have to
see him off with smiles?

141
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:40,456
Kyoto is really a good place

142
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,256
Listen

143
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:43,566
I brought you here
with a good will..

144
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:45,396
Don't interfere with my work

145
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,836
Alright

146
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:48,766
No problem

147
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,136
Conan has left for Kyoto

148
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,476
There is a temple
called Sannouzi

149
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,846
So Mouri is asked to
probe into the case

150
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:59,816
We'd like to go to Kyoto soon

151
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,486
I can take you there

152
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,246
Really?

153
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,156
So I can see Conan there

154
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,386
Kyoto..Kyoto..
We'll go to..

155
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,696
But you have to answer
these questions..

156
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:13,796
Here we go

157
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,366
You aren't planning to
take us there

158
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,596
That has nothing to do
with this

159
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:19,266
Let him do it

160
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,236
Perhaps we can kill some time

161
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,146
What can we do?

162
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,536
Let's give it a try

163
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,236
That's right

164
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,906
You know who Benkei is
Right?

165
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,986
Yes..he's Yoshitune's servant

166
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,646
Hey..who's Yoshitune?

167
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,656
His nickname is Usiwakamaru

168
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:40,726
On the 5 big bridges in Kyoto

169
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:47,956
He defeated Benkei who wanted to
get the 1 000th sword

170
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:51,006
At that time, the Genzi
and the Hira were in a war

171
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,626
And Yoshitune won

172
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,036
However, his brother, Razou
hated him

173
00:10:56,176 --> 00:11:01,636
At last he killed himself
in Hiraizumi no Koromogawa

174
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,976
I know a lot about him

175
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,706
I'll ask you some questions now

176
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:09,576
Benkei has a lover
called Uzune

177
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:13,086
That girl is gonna marry
someone else

178
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:15,126
After Benkei knows about this

179
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:17,016
He will be..1.angry

180
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,686
2.happy

181
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,596
3.sad

182
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:21,956
Which one is true?

183
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,256
First lover?

184
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:32,366
Of course he will be angry

185
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,806
He can't be happy

186
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:38,216
So you think the answer is 1?

187
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:39,546
It's "sad"..

188
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,246
The answer is 3

189
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:47,186
You get the idea from
"Benkei's weakness"

190
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,956
Ai is so cool

191
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,186
What is "Benkei's weakness"

192
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,426
Benkei is outstanding..

193
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:59,596
but he cries when he's hurt too

194
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:00,606
That's here

195
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,796
The fore part of the leg
is called "Benkai's weakness"

196
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:08,416
But does this have anything
to do with the question?

197
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,676
Uhh..

198
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,246
I see

199
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:16,586
So the groom and Uzune
will get married

200
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:17,916
The groom and Uzune

201
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:19,756
Groom Uzune (In Japanese,
it sounds like the fore part of the leg)

202
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,756
It's not funny at all

203
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,996
But..since we've got
the right answer

204
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,756
We can go to Kyoto now

205
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:30,386
Ah..no
Because Ai got the right answer

206
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:34,526
And he's a member
of the Youth Detectives

207
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:37,806
Don't estrange Haibara

208
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:42,676
My mom told me
to keep my promises

209
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,166
Thanks for your patronage

210
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:58,986
Thanks..

211
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,326
That's right

212
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:10,996
But you can't tell others
about this

213
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:11,906
(Ryuen, a monk in Sannouzi)

214
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,236
Oh..Mr. Mouri

215
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,846
Thanks for coming

216
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:20,346
I am Ryuen..
I talked to you on the phone

217
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,916
Please allow me to introduce to you

218
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,456
This is the master, Enkai

219
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:28,056
These three are the faithful
of this temple

220
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,086
This is Mr. Sakura Syouzou

221
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,236
He's running an antique shop
on Teramati Road

222
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:37,226
Are you the famous detective
Mouri Kogorou

223
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:41,136
Ah..really?
Am I famous?

224
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:44,506
And this one is a young master

225
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:46,106
Mizou Syuntarou

226
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,716
This is Mr. Saizyou Taiga
the owner of a 2-hand book store

227
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:52,346
Nice to know you

228
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:55,386
Actually the faithfuls and us
are friends in swordcraft

229
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:58,316
Everyone is learning swordcraft?

230
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:02,226
No wonder you look so healthy

231
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,326
Friends in swordcraft?

232
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,796
By the way..
they say in this temple

233
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:11,096
there's a Buddhist statue
presented to the public every 12 years

234
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:12,206
Yes

235
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,606
That is the main statue of this temple
Medicine Buddha

236
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:17,536
And it will be presented for worships
the day after tomorrow

237
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:20,376
We are looking forwards to it

238
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,946
Thanks to you

239
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,246
I bet the Buddha will be delighted

240
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,856
What are you saying?

241
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,856
The Buddha is gone?

242
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,086
Yes..it happened 8 years ago

243
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,426
On the left side is
Sun Buddha

244
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:44,126
and the right..
Moon Buddha

245
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,666
But in the center, Medicine Buddha
was stolen

246
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,246
I meant to report to the police

247
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,916
but the master stopped me

248
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:59,876
He said..
let the fate be

249
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,746
He's really optimistic

250
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,846
So it's been 8 years now

251
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:09,986
But 5 days ago..
a letter was tossed in the mailbox

252
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,056
without any stamps on it

253
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,896
There's no sender

254
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:22,906
and it says we can find the statue
if we solve the puzzle

255
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,806
What map is it?

256
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,946
Thanks..sir

257
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,556
It's really hard to look for
eye-witnesses to this kind of cases

258
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,096
There's a thief

259
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:44,286
Get away

260
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,106
It hurts

261
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:51,596
You'd better watch out

262
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,936
If I hit your Benkei's weakness

263
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,606
You'll suffer

264
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,406
This is yours..madam

265
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:03,006
Thank you..
You were so great

266
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,976
Really..thanks

267
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:08,416
I am running a tea house
in Miyagawatyou

268
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,316
My name is Yamakura Tae

269
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,656
Say hello to them

270
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:14,486
Yes

271
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:19,196
I am Tika Suzu..
Nice to meet you

272
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,166
How should I repay you?

273
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:27,276
It's not necessary..

274
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:30,306
Please drop by my shop
next time

275
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:32,606
Take care then

276
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,106
Thank you

277
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:48,446
What is this map about?

278
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:54,666
On the 5th layer..
you see cricket, dog, and gold fish

279
00:16:54,896 --> 00:17:00,026
And the 4th layer..
chicken and..loach?

280
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,296
The yellow loach looks disgusting

281
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,466
What is it?

282
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:07,006
It should be just stains

283
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:10,006
And in between the 2nd and the 3rd

284
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,916
There are violet, dogs,
and Fuji mountain

285
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,616
And next to them are nuts

286
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:17,416
Father

287
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:19,646
Can we find it
before the day after tomorrow?

288
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:21,726
Don't worry

289
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:25,486
I can handle it..
A piece of cake

290
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,026
Hey..is that true

291
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,966
Let the experts handle it

292
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:33,566
Let's go visit Kyoto now

293
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,506
Go ahead

294
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,766
You will only make troubles

295
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:40,906
Actually I talked to Kazuha

296
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:44,206
She will take us to Kyoto
tomorrow

297
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:47,406
But she said Hattori will be busy

298
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:50,886
It doesn't matter
since he's not available now

299
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:53,646
That guy is not coming

300
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:56,116
Conan..come with us

301
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,726
Ah..I'm not going with you

302
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:02,166
I'm going fishing with the kids
living nearby

303
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,636
Wow..you have made local friends
so quickly

304
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,256
But you have to be careful

305
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:13,276
I bet Genzihotaru
must be the thief

306
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:14,976
But

307
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,676
Why is there a map?

308
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,686
And is there any connection
with the 5 murder cases?

309
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,326
Genzihotaru..

310
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:28,416
Speaking of Yoshitune and Benkei

311
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,456
I think that's the only place
we should check out

312
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,096
(The 5 Big Bridges)

313
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:48,276
I don't see anything related to
this mysterious map

314
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,816
On the 5 big bridges in Kyoto

315
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:57,116
The strong man, Benkei
held his long sword

316
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:59,156
and waved it towards Usiwakamaru

317
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,426
Hattori

318
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:07,826
I can't believe
I will meet you here

319
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,396
It's really interesting
for us to meet here

320
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,296
Sir..can I have the knife back?

321
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:16,266
Oh..I'm sorry

322
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,396
Thanks

323
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:18,876
Let's go

324
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,536
You have to practice more

325
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,276
Why did you borrow the knife?

326
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,716
Let's not talk about this
What are you doing here?

327
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,046
I wanna ask you this question

328
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:37,286
The owner of an octopus ball shop
in Osaka was killed

329
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,826
We were very familiar

330
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:42,736
Although he was rumored to be
a member of the gang

331
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,636
I often visited that shop
when I was a student

332
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:47,396
He was nice to me

333
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,526
So I wanna find out the murder
and take revenge for him

334
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:55,706
That's why you come here
to look for the clues

335
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,006
If so..I wanna show you something

336
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:04,676
I see

337
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,646
Just solve this puzzle

338
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,346
You can not only
find the statue

339
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:11,466
but also get the clues
critical to the murder case

340
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:13,056
That's why you..

341
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:14,096
Right

342
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:16,926
If Genzihotaru was the one
who stole the statue

343
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,866
Maybe we can find clues
to the puzzle

344
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:23,936
at the places involved with
Yoshitune and Benkei

345
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:26,136
But I'm not familiar with Kyoto

346
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,676
So..count on me

347
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,576
I'll lead you

348
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,716
This is the 5 Gods

349
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,016
According to Yoshitune Book

350
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,326
They didn't first meet on the bridge
but at this place

351
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,496
So..is there any connection?

352
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:51,936
No..I don't think so

353
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,336
So let's go to the next place

354
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:56,066
But I can't accept it

355
00:20:56,846 --> 00:21:01,076
Why doesn't the monk
ask me for the help?

356
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,946
I should be the first one
he comes up with in Kansai area

357
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:08,276
They don't want to
expose the incident

358
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,756
Because your father
is a high-ranking police official

359
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:14,856
Forget it

360
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:19,256
Wait..it's really weird

361
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,666
We're here..
It's right here

362
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,306
Benkei Stone?

363
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:33,706
Benkei often sat on it

364
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:36,036
Someone said he threw it down
from Hiezan Mountain

365
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:38,516
There are numerous legends

366
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,446
But there's no connection
with one another

367
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:44,346
Really..
let's check out the next place

368
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:45,756
Where are we going then?

369
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:48,086
Keage Slope

370
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:52,196
I am a police detective in Kyoto
Ayanokouzi

371
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:56,396
You're probing into
Genzihotaru's case?

372
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,526
This is not Osaka

373
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,796
You'd better not get involved

374
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:09,736
It's a squirrel

375
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:12,076
You see?

376
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:19,156
There are strange detectives
everywhere

377
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,286
(Kiyomizudera Temple)

378
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,886
Let's take pictures now

379
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:25,756
I want the cheery blossoms
to be the background

380
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,866
It's so beautiful

381
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,436
It's really beautiful

382
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:34,626
It would be great
if Makoto was here too

383
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,836
Ran..you are embarrassing me

384
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,096
You often do that to me too

385
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:49,746
Kazuha..
You had a quarrel with Hattori?

386
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:55,386
Heiji often comes to Kyoto
for a certain case

387
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:59,126
And his first lover
also lives in Kyoto

388
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:06,296
(Keage Slope Park)

389
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,666
(Yoshitune Sun Buddha)

390
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,906
This is not right

391
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,376
Let's go have lunch

392
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:17,306
Alright

393
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,186
Cheery blossoms

394
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,526
It's nothing

395
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:35,326
It reminds me of
what happened 8 years ago

396
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,596
I had an adventurous trip
to temples in Kyoto

397
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:41,436
My head hit the window frame
of a temple

398
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:44,836
and the frames were broken

399
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,706
and I fell to the ground

400
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,436
I fainted

401
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:53,646
and I don't know
how long I slept..

402
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:55,546
When I came to myself
I just remembered

403
00:23:56,286 --> 00:24:00,126
Passing through 8 avenues
I'll get to Tonsi Avenue

404
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:05,196
And the last one is
the 9th Avenue

405
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:10,596
Maarutakeebisuni
Oshioike

406
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:16,176
Rokakku Bride
Takonishiki

407
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:21,366
Shiayabttakamatu
Wan 5 units

408
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:26,216
Snow shoes..ding-ding-dong-dong

409
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,376
6 units..

410
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:57,676
It was like a dream
but I'm sure it happened to me

411
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,586
I felt someday we'll meet again

412
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,216
Hey..what's so funny about it?

413
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:11,656
I'm sorry

414
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:12,766
Please go on

415
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:15,886
I'll take this with me
whenever I come to Kyoto

416
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:19,096
Crystal ball?

417
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,136
I have seen it somewhere before

418
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:23,136
Really?

419
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:25,966
Does anyone have the same thing?

420
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,106
Nope

421
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:30,906
So..does she know about this?

422
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,516
She?

423
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,476
You mean Kazuha?

424
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,316
I have never mentioned to her
but she seems to know about it

425
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:41,656
It's because..

426
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:44,756
The magazine report?

427
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:48,956
Right..a very popular magazine
in Kansai area..

428
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:52,826
The reporter interviewed Heiji
about his first love

429
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:58,406
He met a girl a little bit older
than him when he was in the 3rd year

430
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:02,376
And he showed something
very important to that girl

431
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:05,486
and we shot pictures too

432
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,546
What is this?

433
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,376
An ordinary crystal ball

434
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,576
I think the girl gave him this

435
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,946
So you and that girl..

436
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:15,686
I don't know her

437
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:19,226
And Heiji seems to have met her
only once

438
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:22,386
He visits her
whenever he comes to Kyoto

439
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:25,626
Ah..that's why he holds
the ball in the picture

440
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:31,936
He wants to show to that girl
through the report

441
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:34,006
He's pretty wicked

442
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,446
And there's a picture of him
in his childhood

443
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:40,886
Wow..so cute

444
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,386
Right..Heiji at this time.

445
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:48,556
Ran..this is not important

446
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:51,126
Don't care too much about it

447
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:53,956
Even if he has a first lover

448
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:56,326
That's the past

449
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,456
I think your relationship
is very stable

450
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:04,906
But for men..
first love is very special

451
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:06,606
Sonako

452
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:10,446
Don't talk about this anymore

453
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,516
By the way..Would you like to
drink some adzuki bean soup?

454
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:15,046
Madam..3 bowls

455
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,776
Please serve them quickly

456
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,056
This is the west gate
of Kuramadera

457
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:35,006
Usually we have to go from
Renwan Gate

458
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:37,436
But it's faster to go from here

459
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:42,306
(Kuramadera Temple)
( Altitude: 588 meters)

460
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:10,436
This is Sango Fudoudone

461
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:15,246
Uniwakamaru met sky-dog
and learned swordcraft from him

462
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:21,406
This is a good place
for practicing swordcraft

463
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:26,786
But this tree is really tall

464
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,226
Heiji..this is..

465
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,496
Get down

466
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:42,006
Don't run

467
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,466
Hey..Kudo

468
00:28:58,656 --> 00:29:00,526
This guy is like Uniwakamaru

469
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:10,666
Damn

470
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,766
Kudo..catch it
Gotta go

471
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:33,586
He's coming right after us

472
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:04,886
How can he make it?

473
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:20,526
(Kuramadera Temple)

474
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:31,036
(Kuramadera Station)

475
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,676
Please get on the train now

476
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:34,846
The train will leave right away

477
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,446
No..you don't have to rush

478
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,196
Hey..this is the rail

479
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,296
I will be distracted

480
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:49,526
Don't talk to me

481
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,796
Violation of traffic law

482
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,336
You'll get your license suspended

483
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:06,816
What does he want?

484
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:22,326
Damn

485
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,356
We can almost make it

486
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:30,176
That should be the one
who killed Genzihotaru's members

487
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:31,426
I think so

488
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,436
But I don't know
why he wants to kill you

489
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,176
It's so strange..Heiji

490
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:45,586
Why are you here?

491
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,416
I bumped into Ku..

492
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,686
No..this kid

493
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,156
We wanted to solve the puzzle

494
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:56,326
And how about it now?

495
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:57,366
Not yet

496
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,266
It's pretty hard

497
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,466
By the way..
has the uncle solved it?

498
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,406
Eh..

499
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:28,786
I really miss her

500
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:42,746
The dangling ribbon..

501
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,556
Good job..Ms. Tika Suzu

502
00:32:58,696 --> 00:33:00,126
The first in Japan

503
00:33:00,266 --> 00:33:02,926
Thanks..for your compliment

504
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:06,126
Come..pour wine for Master Mouri

505
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:07,166
Yes

506
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:19,946
Please..

507
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:25,826
Kogorou is so delighted

508
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,786
So don't come back anymore

509
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:31,896
Why are you here?

510
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:35,296
The master told us

511
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:37,926
The master told you to come?

512
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:40,726
So do you wanna come along?

513
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:43,606
I'm sorry for the bother

514
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:52,106
It's strange..
You are from Miyagawatyou..

515
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:54,916
Yes..I am Tika Suzu

516
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,146
Thanks for the help

517
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:59,416
Do you know each other, Heiji?

518
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,286
Ah..I think so

519
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:04,756
Come on..
You get out of the line again

520
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:08,426
Ran..don't blame him

521
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:10,936
We invited him to come

522
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:11,996
Right

523
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:16,736
Let's ask the famous detective
to analyze Genzihotaru's case

524
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:22,246
They say all of their members
have a Yoshitune Book

525
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,036
I have one

526
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:26,116
That is a good book

527
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:27,376
Right..2-hand book dealer

528
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:28,816
Yes

529
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:31,976
But I don't like it very much

530
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:33,116
Its name is Yoshitune Book..

531
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:37,056
But in fact..it's a biography
of Benkei's admirable deeds

532
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:38,886
I like it very much

533
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,626
Especially the "Secure Residence"

534
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,786
What does that mean?

535
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:46,026
It's the name of a Noh play

536
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,536
In order to escape
the pursuit

537
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:51,976
Yoshitune and his servants
disguised themselves as monks

538
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,706
and planned to pass the checkpoint
at the secure residence

539
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:58,786
When Yoshitune
was almost discovered

540
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:03,406
Benkei used his King-kong stick
to hit Yoshitune

541
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:04,646
Why?

542
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,986
In order to deceive the guards

543
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:12,686
No one will ever believe
a servant will hit his master

544
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:17,236
And then Yoshitune passed
the checkpoint

545
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:21,206
When Benkei asked for pardon
with tears

546
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,896
Yoshitune complimented him
for his quick wits

547
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:27,166
You can see the strong tie
in their relationship

548
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:28,906
It has become a famous story

549
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:34,576
I'm sorry..
I don't have enough sleep here

550
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,176
Can I take a rest here?

551
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:41,886
There's no other guest tonight

552
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,156
You can go to the next room

553
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:46,756
No..I prefer the rooms downstairs

554
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,496
So..please wake me up
at 9 o'clock

555
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:54,796
Please enjoy now

556
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:03,806
Wow..I can see the river

557
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:05,536
That is Kamogawa River

558
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:07,416
The cherry blossoms
are so beautiful

559
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,016
Yeah..

560
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:11,086
Ran..come over

561
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:15,816
It's not bad for valentines
to sit by the river

562
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:20,916
But it's even better

563
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,056
to appreciate the blossoms
across from Misogigawa

564
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,686
Yeah..so beautiful

565
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,966
Ayah..I can't believe it

566
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:29,666
It's like white fish

567
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,366
I wanna eat it

568
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:36,276
Are you wounded?

569
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,436
Yes..a little bit

570
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,806
Let Kogorou heal you

571
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:42,576
Don't go overboard

572
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:45,816
You just don't get it

573
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,116
Hey..look over there

574
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:52,056
Captain Ayanokouzi

575
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:54,686
What is he doing over there?

576
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:58,966
You can appreciate blossoms
on that platform

577
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:03,366
After the clouds go away
we can see the moon

578
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:04,306
Let's check it out

579
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:06,136
Mmm..alright

580
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,006
I'll stay here

581
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:09,116
So will I

582
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:10,506
Why?

583
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,586
Are you interested
in that dancer?

584
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,586
Idiot..don't say that

585
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:28,366
I lost

586
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,826
That guy is crazy

587
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:33,096
He's always like that

588
00:37:33,236 --> 00:37:36,226
Tika Suzu..
One more time..one more time

589
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:37,736
I wanna go to the toilet

590
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:38,936
That's alright

591
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:42,136
I'm not drunk
You stay with Master Mouri

592
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,076
Yes

593
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:45,146
Alright..it's my turn

594
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:48,886
Oh..the moon is coming out

595
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:54,916
Moon?

596
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,996
What's wrong?

597
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:58,056
Nothing

598
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:02,226
It reminds me of
my appointment with Ran

599
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:06,426
It was 2 hours later
when I remembered it

600
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:07,906
That's incredible

601
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:12,066
I thought she's left

602
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,006
But I still went to that place

603
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:26,756
Who is it?

604
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:34,126
I'm sorry..Ran

605
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,356
I forgot about the appointment

606
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:37,796
Great

607
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:41,896
I've been worrying about you

608
00:38:47,946 --> 00:38:49,376
It was that time..

609
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:53,536
You found she wasn't
just your childhood friend

610
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:55,116
Idiot

611
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:56,476
That's not true

612
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,976
I have been..

613
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:06,666
Now she's still waiting for me

614
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:11,586
Ran..what's wrong with you?

615
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,096
Nothing

616
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,226
Heiji that guy..

617
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:19,806
I'm really pissed

618
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:23,436
But..Kazuha
I envy you

619
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:27,686
Because you can see each other
anytime you want

620
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:30,416
Ran

621
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,216
That's right

622
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:35,616
It's not easy for me
to see Makoto

623
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:38,526
There are too many troubles
for girls

624
00:39:38,696 --> 00:39:39,286
Come on now

625
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:41,056
Compared with us

626
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:43,796
Your father is really energetic

627
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:00,816
Ayah

628
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,856
Mr. Sakura
It's 9 o'clock now

629
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,056
Mr. Sakura

630
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,126
I'm sorry for the bother

631
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:18,366
It's so strange..

632
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,496
Where is he?

633
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,246
Is he..

634
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:36,546
Mr. Sakura

635
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:42,396
Strange?

636
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,356
What's going on with the scream?

637
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,126
Help

638
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,566
What's wrong?

639
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:57,696
Mr. Sakura..

640
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:04,136
Mr. Sakura

641
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,386
Don't let anyone come in

642
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:08,486
Ran..call the police

643
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:09,446
Alright

644
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:14,356
The neck artery is cut
with a sharp knife

645
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,046
It's like done by a pro

646
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:19,186
Maybe along with a series of cases
they are done by the same person

647
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,266
Classmate?
No wonder you look familiar

648
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,196
You are the student detective
Hattori Heiji

649
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:26,326
Right

650
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,836
Before the police comes

651
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:30,566
Please stay in your room

652
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:33,176
and don't come outside

653
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:35,476
I now

654
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:44,916
I think Mr. Sakura was killed
while he was looking for something

655
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:46,616
What was he looking for?

656
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,856
The button on this shirt
was torn down

657
00:41:51,196 --> 00:41:55,526
The criminal couldn't wait to
take the clothes off

658
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,756
But the wallet full of cash
wasn't stolen

659
00:41:59,606 --> 00:42:01,666
So it wasn't about money

660
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:05,566
Don't touch the corpse

661
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:07,366
How many times should I repeat?

662
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:11,046
It hurts

663
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:15,816
Coming

664
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:18,116
I am a police detective in Kyoto
Ayanokouzi

665
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:20,186
Thank you for coming

666
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:21,256
Please come in

667
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:22,726
Stay outside

668
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:23,686
Yes

669
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,966
Isn't this the detective?

670
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:30,826
You are so fast

671
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:35,566
You don't bring your squirrel?

672
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:39,436
I don't bring it out
everyday

673
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:43,476
What do you think
about this case?

674
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:45,546
It's not impossible
for outsiders to do it

675
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:47,776
But the door makes noise
when it's opened

676
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,506
And the madam
should've heard it

677
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:51,116
So it's more likely..

678
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:56,556
the murder knew
Mr. Sakura would be in the warehouse

679
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:57,756
That's to say..

680
00:42:57,896 --> 00:42:59,586
Mr. Sakura's friends..

681
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:05,256
Saizyou, Ryuen, and Mizuo
are more likely to be the suspects

682
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,406
They went to the toilet respectively

683
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,596
after Mr. Sakura and Ran
went out

684
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:15,576
And the stair to the basement
is next to the toilet

685
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:18,576
So they could pretend
going to the toilet

686
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:23,516
and kill Mr. Sakura
in the basement

687
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:27,646
But I'm confused with one thing

688
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:32,486
Ms. Tika Suzu going with
Mr. Mizuo to the toilet

689
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,996
It's common for dancers
to do that

690
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:40,156
But she didn't go with
Mr. Ryuen and Saizyou

691
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:43,206
That's because she was playing
with the uncle

692
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:44,276
So we can say..

693
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:47,346
The murder went to the toilet
at this time

694
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:51,316
We can presume the murder
is either Mr. Ryuen or Saizyou

695
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:53,146
And Mr. Mizuo is innocent

696
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:55,946
If Ms. Tika Suzu isn't
the accomplice

697
00:43:58,056 --> 00:43:58,986
That's right..

698
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:00,946
so..let's go now

699
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:04,016
You can't pretend

700
00:44:04,156 --> 00:44:07,396
You took that away
for the investigation

701
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,266
You mean this?

702
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:13,896
I remember his shop
is located on Shitin Road

703
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:16,566
(Sakura Antique Shop)

704
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:26,806
Yoshitune Book

705
00:44:29,386 --> 00:44:30,546
Ise no Saburou

706
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:32,246
Hattori

707
00:44:36,026 --> 00:44:37,016
What?

708
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:39,716
Mr. Sakura is Ise no Saburou

709
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:42,216
What is this?

710
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,136
This..

711
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:46,096
The copy of this map

712
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:48,136
What's going on?

713
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:51,636
Mr. Sakura's map shows..

714
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:56,376
He mailed the letter
to the temple

715
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:58,816
But for what?

716
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:03,076
What?
Sakura is Ise no Saburou?

717
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:07,176
Yes..he's the member
of Genzihatoru

718
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:11,086
Wait..so the victims are..

719
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:15,096
Am I the next one
for I have "5" in my name

720
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:19,196
That happened long ago

721
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:24,096
Since Sakura's map
is just a duplicate

722
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:26,796
That means Sakura
has the original with him

723
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:29,306
And the murderer took it away

724
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:30,676
I see

725
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:35,116
The killer didn't know
Sakura has a copy

726
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:38,446
Who will he be?

727
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:42,716
I think Mr. Ryuen, Saizyou
and Mr. Mizuo are the suspects

728
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,346
One of them..

729
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:48,356
But they are not armed

730
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,626
Because we've checked their bodies
after you left

731
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:57,336
No one will be so stupid
that he brings the weapon with him

732
00:45:57,476 --> 00:45:59,876
He should've dumped it
or hid it

733
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:03,466
We haven't found anything
in the shop

734
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:05,106
What about Misogigawa River

735
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:08,586
Is it thrown out of the window
in the basement?

736
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:12,086
Right..I think so

737
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:18,056
Sonako heard some noise
from the river

738
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:18,926
Really?

739
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:20,466
That's right

740
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:26,596
But the police found nothing
in the search

741
00:46:26,736 --> 00:46:29,036
It's really strange

742
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:31,136
So there are accomplices

743
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:34,806
I think someone has picked
up the weapon

744
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:37,506
I don't think so

745
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:40,806
Why no?
Conan

746
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:44,046
It's full moon tonight
It's very bright tonight

747
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:48,846
If there's any fissures..
we can see under

748
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:52,096
If there are accomplices

749
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,556
Ran should have discovered that

750
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:56,556
Right

751
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:58,166
I know the truth

752
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,566
The murder is from the outside

753
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:03,296
Before Ran came to the platform

754
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:05,876
He sneaked into
from the basement window

755
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:08,736
and hid himself
in the toilet

756
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:13,006
He killed Mr. Sakura
when he looked for something

757
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:18,086
And then escaped
from the window

758
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:21,126
We didn't see anyone suspicious

759
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:24,156
There are no eye-witnesses

760
00:47:24,296 --> 00:47:25,816
This is just a coincidence
This is just a co-incidence

761
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:28,156
And the murderer
is just lucky

762
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:31,326
I think it's not true

763
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:05,066
We met that guy
on Kuramadera Mountain

764
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:20,446
Kazuha..hold tight

765
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:21,606
What?

766
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:36,326
Stay here..you see

767
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:38,526
Heiji

768
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:58,146
Wanna challenge me?

769
00:48:58,286 --> 00:48:59,256
Fine

770
00:49:03,626 --> 00:49:05,386
What?
There are weaknesses everywhere

771
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:11,426
Does he wear
any wrist protection pad?

772
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:31,756
Are you the one
who killed Mr. Sakura?

773
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,046
If so..
I'll treat you

774
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:35,416
like how you treat him

775
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:11,716
This is not what you want

776
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:15,356
The sight gets blurry

777
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:29,836
Mr. police
Here..

778
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:40,316
Heiji..are you okay?

779
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:42,586
Kazuha..how about the police?

780
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:45,286
That's not real

781
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:49,026
Where did you learn this?

782
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:51,186
What a terrible woman

783
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,036
Heiji

784
00:50:56,736 --> 00:50:59,296
(Mayshirou Hospital)

785
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:05,646
Heiji..are you awake?

786
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:06,906
Heiji..

787
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:08,206
Great

788
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,406
I'm so worried about you
Heiji

789
00:51:12,256 --> 00:51:15,746
Mr. Ootaki
And..who is this?

790
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:19,016
I am Shiratori
from the Police Department

791
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:23,256
I heard Sakura used to be
a member of Genzihotaru

792
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:25,056
So I came immediately

793
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:26,966
Is it painful?

794
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:28,496
It is..

795
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:34,176
We have found the stolen artifacts
in Sakura's shop

796
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:36,106
Are you awake?

797
00:51:36,546 --> 00:51:38,606
Mr. Police
How about that knife?

798
00:51:38,746 --> 00:51:40,616
I'll ask someone to test it

799
00:51:41,116 --> 00:51:43,386
Please inform me
when the result comes out

800
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,486
If there's no enough evidence

801
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:48,586
You can take samples
from my wound on the shoulder

802
00:51:48,726 --> 00:51:50,916
Eh? What evidence?

803
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:56,086
The knife was used
to kill Mr. Sakura

804
00:51:56,466 --> 00:52:00,366
It's better if we can find
anything the murder touched

805
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:03,796
What about the motorcycle?
Isn't there a motorcycle?

806
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:05,706
That is a stolen one

807
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:08,136
Can you find the evidence?

808
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:16,376
By the way..
Do you have any ideas?

809
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:19,816
This was found in Yoshitune Book
in Sakura's place

810
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:22,486
You have no ideas?

811
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:25,316
Forget about it

812
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:32,896
After this incident
you'd better be careful next time

813
00:52:33,806 --> 00:52:35,396
So..I gotta go

814
00:52:36,606 --> 00:52:38,306
Take care..

815
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:46,576
I'll call my father

816
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:50,346
I'll ask the doctor for you

817
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:52,986
Conan is with me

818
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,526
Ran..I gotta go out

819
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:56,856
Please take care of Heiji

820
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:12,136
Are you not gonna
stay in the hospital?

821
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,366
I'll be alright

822
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:16,306
But that guy is really weird

823
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:18,306
I have never seen
the swordcraft style

824
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:22,706
Maybe he has added iron bars
to the protection pad

825
00:53:22,856 --> 00:53:26,376
I meant to match the weapon
with the wound

826
00:53:26,526 --> 00:53:28,926
That's why I made him
hurt me with the knife

827
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:31,326
But he didn't take away
the knife

828
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:32,616
Why not?

829
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:34,126
Not only that..

830
00:53:34,366 --> 00:53:40,236
When we fought..that guy
wanted to pick the bag I dropped

831
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:42,466
I don't get it

832
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:46,596
Is that masked guy
your first lover?

833
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:48,766
Bingo

834
00:53:49,346 --> 00:53:50,506
How is this possible?

835
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:53,206
(Mizuo's Residence)

836
00:53:53,686 --> 00:53:56,276
You were attacked afterwards?

837
00:53:56,416 --> 00:54:00,786
That's why I wanna know
if Mr. Mizuo has an alibi?

838
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:03,946
Because the murderer
wore a Noh-play mask

839
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:05,686
A Noh-play mask

840
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:10,696
Can I ask Mr. Saizyou and Ryuen?
if they have the alibi?

841
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:11,956
We too?

842
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:13,496
Come on

843
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:20,266
We meant to discuss on the case
with Ms. Tika Suzu

844
00:54:20,406 --> 00:54:21,396
Right?

845
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:23,806
That's alright

846
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:27,176
After I left the tea house
I headed home directly

847
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:29,646
But I'm single

848
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:32,156
So there's a distance
between my mom's room and mine

849
00:54:32,286 --> 00:54:36,156
I can't prove
if I were at home at that time

850
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:38,256
Neither can I

851
00:54:38,396 --> 00:54:42,486
Because I live on the 2nd floor
of the shop at Shiting Road

852
00:54:42,636 --> 00:54:48,296
I chanted at the hall
and went back to my room

853
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:49,906
No one can prove for me

854
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,136
I see..

855
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:52,936
I have another question

856
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:55,706
Do you practice shooting arrows?

857
00:54:55,846 --> 00:54:57,776
Arrows?
Nope

858
00:54:57,916 --> 00:55:02,376
I used to do it
on the Noh-play stage

859
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:07,856
I tried to imitate
shooting the devil with arrows

860
00:55:07,986 --> 00:55:13,756
So no one in the tea house
was able to use arrows

861
00:55:13,896 --> 00:55:16,426
I remember ..Yamakura

862
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:19,966
Mrs. Yamakura practices
shooting arrows?

863
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:22,536
But she wasn't there

864
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:24,196
Ah..sorry

865
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:26,006
Sorry for the bother

866
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:27,436
Ah..she's coming

867
00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:29,036
Strange

868
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:29,976
What?

869
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:31,506
Come in..

870
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,176
Sister..
You must be Ms. Tika Suzu

871
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:34,806
Yes..I am

872
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:37,786
You must be surprised
at my look

873
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,186
Yes..please come in

874
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:41,886
Thanks

875
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:54,896
Thanks for your help

876
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:57,066
Please come again

877
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:58,606
You are welcome

878
00:56:01,576 --> 00:56:03,406
Thanks..goodbye

879
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:07,486
Sannouzi Temple
is on Rokakku Road

880
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:09,986
This is Ichan Road

881
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,646
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

882
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:18,526
Sister Rokakku
So it's the 6th road

883
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:25,466
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

884
00:56:26,406 --> 00:56:28,136
What was that?

885
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:32,176
Eh..we call it a ball song

886
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:38,376
It's made up with
all the avenues in Kyoto

887
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:42,806
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

888
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:47,516
Sister Rokakku
Takonishiki

889
00:56:47,656 --> 00:56:51,886
Shiayabttakamatu
Wan five units

890
00:56:52,026 --> 00:56:55,866
Snow shoes
Ding-ding-dong-dong

891
00:56:55,996 --> 00:57:00,336
Passing through the 6th
and the 7th..and the 8th

892
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:04,876
You'll get to Township Avenue

893
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:09,606
And then you'll see
the 9th avenue

894
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:15,486
All the kids in Kyoto
remembers road names this way

895
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:19,646
So you are from Kyoto too?

896
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:20,986
I am..

897
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:21,646
How old are you?

898
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:24,286
19?

899
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,766
This is Oshioike Road

900
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,166
I gotta go

901
00:57:35,976 --> 00:57:37,066
Goodbye

902
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:38,366
Goodbye

903
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:41,246
You think she is..

904
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,606
I can't make any mistake

905
00:57:42,746 --> 00:57:46,206
She's from Kyoto
and she's 2 years older than me

906
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:49,406
But all the kids in Kyoto
are familiar with the song

907
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:51,516
Finally I can see her
Finally

908
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:54,156
Hey

909
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:55,986
Heiji..what are you doing?

910
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:58,386
How can you get out
of the hospital without permission?

911
00:57:58,526 --> 00:58:00,116
Ah..Mr. Ootaki

912
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:01,816
Forget it..
Let's not talk about this

913
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:04,266
The test result is out

914
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:11,896
Sakura's blood is detected
on the knife

915
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:16,236
And the wound cut
matches the knife's blade

916
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:17,506
Really?

917
00:58:17,716 --> 00:58:20,016
You'd better listen to me

918
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:21,876
Don't do anything stupid

919
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:25,456
If anything happens to you
how am I gonna..

920
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,846
I see

921
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:28,756
Thank you..
Mr. Ootaki

922
00:58:34,926 --> 00:58:37,456
So we can say..the man
with the mask attacked me

923
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:41,036
and also killed Mr. Sakura

924
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:45,736
And those 4 guys
unable to get rid of the weapons

925
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:48,206
are not the suspects anymore?

926
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:06,956
Conan..what are you doing here?

927
00:59:07,366 --> 00:59:08,886
Why are you here?

928
00:59:09,036 --> 00:59:12,556
Because we've answered
Dr. Agasa's question..

929
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:14,496
But Genta..

930
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:16,266
He's lost

931
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,806
If we call him
he is not able..

932
00:59:19,946 --> 00:59:23,006
We have contacted him

933
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,736
But he can't read Chinese words

934
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:27,786
So he can't tell us
where he is now

935
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:31,746
We want to look for him
with your glasses

936
00:59:31,886 --> 00:59:34,286
Ok..count on me

937
00:59:36,796 --> 00:59:37,346
Hey

938
00:59:37,496 --> 00:59:39,826
This is interesting..
It's over there

939
00:59:40,396 --> 00:59:41,256
Come on..

940
00:59:52,346 --> 00:59:54,906
There's a murder case here

941
00:59:55,046 --> 00:59:57,976
Yes..
I'll explain to you later

942
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,106
Come on

943
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,076
Ai..give me the drug

944
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:08,916
What is that?

945
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:11,156
The drug controlling
the growling of the stomach

946
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:14,196
The doctor invented it
for wedding banquets

947
01:00:14,326 --> 01:00:19,566
And those who can't
drink wine at all

948
01:00:19,706 --> 01:00:25,536
Also..there are drugs
giving you symptoms of colds

949
01:00:25,676 --> 01:00:28,106
Ai assisted in the invention

950
01:00:28,246 --> 01:00:30,106
None is useful

951
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:32,176
Oh..here

952
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:34,176
He's in Rokakku Hall

953
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:36,216
Great

954
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:38,176
Great

955
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:39,676
Mom

956
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:41,516
I found Genta

957
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:44,256
I'm saved

958
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:46,056
Great..Genta

959
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:48,686
I thought I can't see you anymore

960
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:49,726
I did too

961
01:00:49,866 --> 01:00:52,196
But this is very convenient

962
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:56,166
A badge communicator

963
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:59,746
Yes..
The signal is sent from that device

964
01:00:59,876 --> 01:01:01,806
This and the glasses
use the same frequency

965
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:03,536
Heiji

966
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:04,616
Now I see

967
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,446
What's going on?

968
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,746
Kudo..is it possible..

969
01:01:17,526 --> 01:01:18,826
It can't be wrong

970
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:22,296
Ah..what that sister heard

971
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:24,926
was the noise
of dumping the weapon

972
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:28,436
Now we can say..
the killer is among the 4

973
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:30,506
No..among the 3

974
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:34,036
My first lover
can't be the killer

975
01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:35,366
Hey

976
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:38,346
It's strange

977
01:01:38,476 --> 01:01:43,476
There's something different
from what I heard before

978
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:50,056
My first lover sang "Bride Rokakku"
instead of "Sister Rokakku"

979
01:01:50,756 --> 01:01:52,316
How come?

980
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:53,656
How do I know that?

981
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:10,106
I have found the broken pieces
of the glasses

982
01:02:21,056 --> 01:02:21,816
Captain

983
01:02:22,596 --> 01:02:24,286
Why do you sigh?

984
01:02:24,496 --> 01:02:25,486
What is this?

985
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:30,166
These were worn
on those victims

986
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:32,356
One, wearing a hat
one, scarf

987
01:02:32,506 --> 01:02:34,466
and the other, gloves

988
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:37,006
All the color, pattern, and clothes
are the same

989
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:39,076
You don't feel anything strange

990
01:02:39,206 --> 01:02:40,606
It's strange

991
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:42,506
Eh..why?

992
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:48,706
If reasonable for one person
to wear the 3 at the same time

993
01:02:48,856 --> 01:02:50,876
If Mekurashi wears this hat

994
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:52,646
And I wear this scarf

995
01:02:52,786 --> 01:02:54,726
and you wear the gloves

996
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:56,086
Don't you think it's strange?

997
01:02:56,226 --> 01:02:58,026
Indeed

998
01:02:58,156 --> 01:03:03,466
It feels like Shiratori is dead
and we share his belongings

999
01:03:04,396 --> 01:03:05,296
That's it

1000
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:07,626
Eh..what's going on?

1001
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:11,426
I'm hungry

1002
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:13,196
Be patient

1003
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:17,036
Ms. Taki Suzu's mom
was an actress Miyagawatyou

1004
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:19,516
She died
when she was five

1005
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,176
She wasn't married

1006
01:03:22,316 --> 01:03:28,116
So Yamakura Tae
brought her up

1007
01:03:28,256 --> 01:03:30,286
She wasn't married

1008
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:31,616
Eh..

1009
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:35,456
She bore the baby
without getting married

1010
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:38,466
She didn't know
who the father was..

1011
01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:42,396
but every month
someone mailed her some money

1012
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:47,376
But 3 months ago
the support was interrupted

1013
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:52,106
It sounds strange

1014
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,276
The money wasn't sent
3 months ago

1015
01:03:55,016 --> 01:03:58,046
But how do you know this?

1016
01:03:58,186 --> 01:04:00,086
Captain Royal told you?

1017
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:01,626
Nope

1018
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:05,626
Don't look down on me
I'm quiet famous here

1019
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,586
This is nothing at all

1020
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:11,456
Everyone says
he's my rival

1021
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:14,536
But I'm not the kind of person
who carries a squirrel everyday

1022
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:15,466
Squirrel?

1023
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:17,836
Yes..he put it in the pocket

1024
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:21,336
But he doesn't take it
to the murder scene

1025
01:04:21,476 --> 01:04:22,876
Squirrel..

1026
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:26,436
Yes..I am Shiratori

1027
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:27,676
I am Mekurashi

1028
01:04:27,816 --> 01:04:31,616
As to Yoshitune and Benkei
we've come up with one idea

1029
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:33,446
Sharing the leftovers?

1030
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,916
If we put it that way
we can solve the puzzle?

1031
01:04:36,056 --> 01:04:42,626
That's to say..
one of them may have died

1032
01:04:43,766 --> 01:04:45,236
I see

1033
01:04:55,816 --> 01:04:56,746
Mr. Mouri

1034
01:04:56,876 --> 01:05:00,436
You know
who the murder is now?

1035
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:01,776
Yes

1036
01:05:03,656 --> 01:05:05,316
Let me tell you

1037
01:05:05,516 --> 01:05:06,716
The murder is..

1038
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:09,346
Ms. Taki Suzu..
You are the one

1039
01:05:10,096 --> 01:05:11,116
How is this possible?

1040
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,086
This is nonsense

1041
01:05:14,396 --> 01:05:15,626
He's alright

1042
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:17,826
Anyway..
let him finish his analysis

1043
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:22,566
You want to take revenge
for your father

1044
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:27,406
And your father was Yoshitune
the leader of the gang

1045
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:33,206
But his men betrayed him
and killed him 3 months ago

1046
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,076
That's why he stopped
mailing the money

1047
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,346
I see

1048
01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:40,456
and you have an accomplice

1049
01:05:40,756 --> 01:05:41,916
That is Benkei

1050
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:43,146
Benkei?

1051
01:05:43,426 --> 01:05:45,686
As to that person..

1052
01:05:45,966 --> 01:05:48,796
Captain Royal..it's you

1053
01:05:50,836 --> 01:05:52,126
Ms. Taki Suzu

1054
01:05:52,266 --> 01:05:55,926
You brought something
to the tea house

1055
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:58,336
That is the knife

1056
01:05:58,476 --> 01:06:00,206
and the captain's squirrel

1057
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:04,736
Wow..so cute

1058
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:07,816
This is the key to the trap

1059
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:09,046
Ms. Taki Suzu

1060
01:06:09,186 --> 01:06:12,816
You pretended to go to
the toilet during the banquet

1061
01:06:12,956 --> 01:06:15,116
And killed Mr. Sakura
in the warehouse

1062
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:19,986
And tied the knife
to that man

1063
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:22,286
You left it go
through the basement window

1064
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:26,636
The squirrel jumped into
Seage River

1065
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:30,736
And then was picked up
by the captain down the stream

1066
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:34,366
After that..the knife
was used to hurt Heiji

1067
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:39,106
So the noise
was caused by the squirrel

1068
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:43,016
You are also involved
in the other murder cases

1069
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:45,646
Mr. Captain..
Can you use arrows?

1070
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:48,886
How can I use it?

1071
01:06:49,026 --> 01:06:50,956
Are you sure?

1072
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:53,796
But Ms. Taki Suzu

1073
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,086
The arrow shooters

1074
01:06:55,226 --> 01:06:58,756
usually have a wound here

1075
01:06:59,236 --> 01:07:00,426
Indeed

1076
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:04,736
My "yanomakura"
is wounded too

1077
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:11,436
But I just learned
and I couldn't hurt anyone

1078
01:07:11,576 --> 01:07:13,416
I think so

1079
01:07:13,546 --> 01:07:19,886
My friends told me
only the beginners hurt that part

1080
01:07:20,026 --> 01:07:23,286
And if you get killed
how can you share the leftovers

1081
01:07:23,426 --> 01:07:24,586
Mr. Mouri

1082
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:27,926
You think she's the killer?

1083
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:29,026
No..I mean

1084
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,656
You must be kidding

1085
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,166
The dancers have to
perform shows and greet guests

1086
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:36,896
I don't have time to do it

1087
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:38,026
Uncle

1088
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:38,936
What's up?

1089
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:40,196
As to that squirrel

1090
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:43,906
It's so small
I think it can't move the knife

1091
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:45,446
You are very nagging

1092
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:47,546
Then I'll prove to you

1093
01:07:50,356 --> 01:07:52,686
Do it now..Squirrel

1094
01:07:52,956 --> 01:07:55,146
I can't stand it

1095
01:07:55,456 --> 01:07:59,726
You intend to ignore me
so as to get out of the guilt

1096
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,156
Stop

1097
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:05,266
It's pitiful..sir

1098
01:08:05,396 --> 01:08:07,266
You are teasing the animal

1099
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,296
You'd better shut up

1100
01:08:09,436 --> 01:08:11,266
Genta..go save the squirrel

1101
01:08:11,406 --> 01:08:12,236
Oh

1102
01:08:12,946 --> 01:08:13,736
Kudo

1103
01:08:14,546 --> 01:08:18,916
Ah..thanks to the uncle
I know who the murderer is

1104
01:08:19,116 --> 01:08:20,306
So do I

1105
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:24,376
Only the arrow shooters
will say that

1106
01:08:24,516 --> 01:08:26,216
We just have to find out
the proof and..

1107
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:29,326
the Buddha statue

1108
01:08:29,556 --> 01:08:32,046
You are so poor..squirrel

1109
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:34,356
Let's feed them

1110
01:08:34,496 --> 01:08:36,426
I have nuts

1111
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:44,666
It's like the song
"Nuts, rolling and rolling"

1112
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:46,426
Nuts, rolling and rolling?

1113
01:08:47,446 --> 01:08:48,496
Maybe..

1114
01:08:53,446 --> 01:08:55,106
Hey..what's wrong with you
Kudo?

1115
01:08:55,246 --> 01:09:00,206
Maybe the duplicated map
refers to the roads in Tokyo

1116
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:01,286
What are you talking about?

1117
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:06,886
Firstly..it's an east-west road

1118
01:09:07,496 --> 01:09:10,796
And on the 5th layer
there are 5 roads

1119
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:14,696
The 4th layer
there are 4 roads

1120
01:09:15,006 --> 01:09:19,406
And in between the 2nd the 3rd layer

1121
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:21,166
There is Oshioike road

1122
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:22,996
The proof is..

1123
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:25,806
Nuts, rolling and rolling?

1124
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:28,676
And then the south-north roads..

1125
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,576
There's a song
referring to violets

1126
01:09:31,716 --> 01:09:33,156
So this means Shichuan Road

1127
01:09:33,286 --> 01:09:35,086
The sky-dog
comes form Kara-sky-god

1128
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:36,786
So it means Karasuma Road

1129
01:09:36,926 --> 01:09:39,486
And there's "fu"
on "Fuji Mountain"

1130
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:41,186
So it means Fu-shao Road

1131
01:09:42,196 --> 01:09:44,026
What about the chicken?

1132
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,096
Loach has something to do
with Laochan Pot

1133
01:09:46,236 --> 01:09:48,666
So this means
Laoma Road

1134
01:09:48,906 --> 01:09:50,426
And the chicken

1135
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:53,536
Does that mean..
Shitonyan Road

1136
01:09:53,806 --> 01:09:56,746
Because it means west

1137
01:09:56,946 --> 01:09:59,416
It's so hard

1138
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:02,116
What does this mean?

1139
01:10:02,246 --> 01:10:07,986
There's a kind of cricket
called Yo-cricket

1140
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,216
And the sky-god
refers to Karasuma Road

1141
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:14,056
The gold fish has something
to do with wheat powder

1142
01:10:14,196 --> 01:10:15,556
So it means
Fuwutin Road

1143
01:10:15,696 --> 01:10:18,796
And then the violet
and Fuji have the same color

1144
01:10:18,936 --> 01:10:23,466
Connect the chicken, cricket,
gold fish, and sky-god

1145
01:10:23,906 --> 01:10:26,996
Wang (Chinese character)
How come?

1146
01:10:29,446 --> 01:10:30,346
This is the point

1147
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:32,036
I think so..

1148
01:10:35,186 --> 01:10:36,706
Tama can be read as "Gyoku"

1149
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:38,316
It means diamonds

1150
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:40,576
This place is..

1151
01:10:41,556 --> 01:10:42,816
Bukkouzi Temple

1152
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:45,956
We've found the treasure

1153
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:05,576
What's wrong with you?

1154
01:11:06,286 --> 01:11:08,946
Nothing..
I feel dizzy

1155
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:15,486
I'm sorry

1156
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:17,596
How do you feel now?

1157
01:11:17,826 --> 01:11:20,556
Ah..better

1158
01:11:21,366 --> 01:11:26,666
Hatori..you broke into
Sannouzi Temple 8 years ago

1159
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,496
How do you know that?

1160
01:11:28,866 --> 01:11:29,736
Idiot

1161
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:33,236
I discovered that from your look
of appreciating the blossoms

1162
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:36,776
And there was a window frame
next to it

1163
01:11:38,276 --> 01:11:39,336
Right

1164
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:43,576
I found the crystal ball
under that tree

1165
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,346
I don't mean to
hurt your feelings

1166
01:11:45,486 --> 01:11:50,446
But wasn't it dropped
by your first lover?

1167
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:52,056
What are you saying?

1168
01:11:52,556 --> 01:11:58,466
It should be the hair
on the stolen statue?

1169
01:11:58,766 --> 01:11:59,736
Hair?

1170
01:12:00,036 --> 01:12:04,166
You mean the splendid hair
on the statue?

1171
01:12:04,306 --> 01:12:05,236
Right

1172
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:08,906
Sometimes they use crystal balls
to replace the hair

1173
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:10,916
It's used in Noh play too

1174
01:12:12,276 --> 01:12:14,176
This is my analysis

1175
01:12:14,386 --> 01:12:19,876
Genzihatoru sneaked into Sannouzi
8 years ago

1176
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:22,456
and stole the statue

1177
01:12:25,826 --> 01:12:29,956
But during the delivery
the hair dropped

1178
01:12:36,806 --> 01:12:39,066
And the leader, Yoshitune
found this..

1179
01:12:39,206 --> 01:12:42,146
and sent someone to look for it

1180
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:43,366
At that time..

1181
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,756
I wanna drink adzuki soup

1182
01:12:57,896 --> 01:12:59,356
I'd like mixed ice

1183
01:13:01,966 --> 01:13:06,396
The leader had no choice
but to put the statue is Sakura's shop

1184
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:09,656
8 years later..
the criminal found

1185
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:13,636
you were the one
he knew 8 years ago

1186
01:13:13,776 --> 01:13:14,746
That magazine?

1187
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:21,606
At this time..
someone happened inside the gang

1188
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:25,086
I think their leader
is seriously ill or something

1189
01:13:25,356 --> 01:13:27,086
Knowing he's not able to make it

1190
01:13:27,226 --> 01:13:31,216
He hid the statue
in a different place

1191
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:35,856
And drew the map
like a puzzle

1192
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:40,226
letting the successor
solve the puzzle

1193
01:13:41,906 --> 01:13:44,096
And then he died?

1194
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:49,466
His men tried to solve the puzzle
but they couldn't get the right answer

1195
01:13:49,616 --> 01:13:50,806
At this time..

1196
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:55,976
One of the members
came to work with the killer

1197
01:13:56,116 --> 01:13:58,776
I think Sakura
saw the killer's swordcraft skills

1198
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:02,116
So he asked someone
to kill all his men

1199
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:07,026
And then they found out
the statue and the hair

1200
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:10,026
They sold it and split the money

1201
01:14:10,296 --> 01:14:16,326
I think the antique shop owner
Mr. Sakura

1202
01:14:16,476 --> 01:14:19,596
has found the way
to sell the stolen antiques

1203
01:14:19,806 --> 01:14:23,246
That's why he said
it was safe

1204
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,316
The criminal pretended to
cooperate with Sakura

1205
01:14:26,446 --> 01:14:28,476
In fact..
he planned to kill them all

1206
01:14:28,616 --> 01:14:31,376
and posses the whole antique

1207
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:36,386
But he still had to solve
the puzzle

1208
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:38,486
So he came up with an idea

1209
01:14:38,626 --> 01:14:42,826
of asking the famous detective
Mouri Kogorou to help him

1210
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:46,426
Bukkouzi Temple..
It's right here

1211
01:14:48,706 --> 01:14:52,036
But is the statue here?

1212
01:14:52,176 --> 01:14:54,836
Yes..
I don't think so

1213
01:14:55,676 --> 01:14:56,336
Hey

1214
01:14:59,016 --> 01:14:59,846
What's wrong with you?

1215
01:15:00,086 --> 01:15:00,916
Hey..Kudo

1216
01:15:01,046 --> 01:15:02,486
What have you come up with?

1217
01:15:04,086 --> 01:15:04,916
This is..

1218
01:15:09,186 --> 01:15:10,346
Yuryu Temple

1219
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:12,116
Is this the point on the map?

1220
01:15:12,256 --> 01:15:13,056
Right

1221
01:15:15,196 --> 01:15:15,996
Kazuha?

1222
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:16,896
It's me

1223
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:18,966
I have the girl

1224
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:23,226
In one hour
come to Yuryu temple alone

1225
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:26,566
If you dare call the police
I'll kill her

1226
01:15:26,706 --> 01:15:27,766
Heiji..you can't come

1227
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:29,136
They will kill you

1228
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:30,006
Kazuha

1229
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:31,046
Kazuha

1230
01:15:31,816 --> 01:15:32,906
Hattori

1231
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:35,776
Kazuha is kidnapped

1232
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:36,616
What?

1233
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:40,946
He wants me to meet him
at Yuryu temple in one hour

1234
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:42,116
Yuryu temple?

1235
01:15:45,756 --> 01:15:47,386
Great

1236
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,956
We'll go together now

1237
01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:55,496
Heiji

1238
01:15:56,266 --> 01:15:58,866
Ray Bridge

1239
01:15:59,536 --> 01:16:03,336
(Learning the father's death
the son came back to Kyoto)

1240
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,706
(When the funeral team came to
the bridge)

1241
01:16:06,846 --> 01:16:10,336
(His father woke up)

1242
01:16:10,486 --> 01:16:13,856
(and talked to his son)

1243
01:16:16,856 --> 01:16:17,756
Hey..

1244
01:16:20,096 --> 01:16:22,396
(Kuramadera Mountain)

1245
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:25,696
(Yuryu Temple)

1246
01:16:37,346 --> 01:16:38,506
This is an instruction
of the master

1247
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:40,136
The knife will be put
in Benkei's drawer

1248
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:42,516
And the arrows
in Rokaku's

1249
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:46,316
Benkei's drawer is..

1250
01:16:46,726 --> 01:16:49,086
From the top
one, two, three

1251
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:53,026
Which are Benkei and Rokaku's?

1252
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:54,786
Bukkouzi Temple?

1253
01:16:55,396 --> 01:16:57,986
I heard them say so

1254
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:06,966
Where are they?

1255
01:17:07,176 --> 01:17:10,076
Kazuha doesn't pick up the phone

1256
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:11,966
Yurye Temple

1257
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:13,516
I am hungry

1258
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:15,546
Really?
I'll cook you something later

1259
01:17:15,686 --> 01:17:16,516
Excuse me

1260
01:17:17,086 --> 01:17:20,286
Where is Yuryu Temple?

1261
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:22,516
Deep in Kuramadera Mountain

1262
01:17:22,656 --> 01:17:26,096
But it was abandoned
long long ago

1263
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,786
Thanks

1264
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,466
Kuramadera Mountain

1265
01:17:40,506 --> 01:17:41,996
Why is he not here yet?

1266
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:45,336
Who will be so stupid?

1267
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:46,966
really?

1268
01:17:47,116 --> 01:17:49,916
Maybe he has no guts

1269
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,416
Heiji

1270
01:18:09,706 --> 01:18:13,136
You didn't hurt Kazuha?

1271
01:18:13,876 --> 01:18:16,276
I..I'm fine..

1272
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:19,876
You want this

1273
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:26,246
In order to get the crystal ball

1274
01:18:26,386 --> 01:18:29,046
You attacked me yesterday

1275
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:31,456
You failed..

1276
01:18:31,596 --> 01:18:34,356
and then you killed Mr. Sakura

1277
01:18:34,496 --> 01:18:37,696
at the tea house
in order to possess the treasure

1278
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:40,366
And I know why you

1279
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:42,056
began with Sandotin
not with Miyagawatyou

1280
01:18:42,206 --> 01:18:45,466
Because there was a river
behind the tea house

1281
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:46,536
River

1282
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:50,806
After you killed Mr. Sakura

1283
01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:55,046
You tossed the detector
of the security company

1284
01:18:55,186 --> 01:18:57,586
and the weapon
into the bottle

1285
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:01,976
And then used mobile phones

1286
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:04,786
to check in the security company's
webpage

1287
01:19:04,926 --> 01:19:07,726
You checked the position
of the detector

1288
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:11,726
and when I was about to
go back to Osaka, you attacked me

1289
01:19:11,866 --> 01:19:14,126
You tried to kill me
with a short knife

1290
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:20,396
Although your plan failed
because of Kazuha's intervention

1291
01:19:20,546 --> 01:19:24,036
You intended to drop the weapon
in order to avoid suspicision

1292
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:28,176
You wanted to let us believe
the murderer was someone else

1293
01:19:28,316 --> 01:19:30,846
Am I right..
Mr. Saizyou Taiga

1294
01:19:30,986 --> 01:19:34,646
No..I should call you..
Misashi pretending Benkei

1295
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:44,726
Hattori Heiji is really outstanding

1296
01:19:44,966 --> 01:19:46,956
How do you know
it's me..

1297
01:19:47,106 --> 01:19:50,866
Because you tried to lie to us
you can't shoot arrows

1298
01:19:51,006 --> 01:19:55,446
When you kneel down
you always pull back your left leg first

1299
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:57,376
That's called "pull half leg"

1300
01:19:57,516 --> 01:20:01,076
The arrow shooters
all have such a habit

1301
01:20:01,216 --> 01:20:04,206
When you were asked
who practices shooting arrows

1302
01:20:04,356 --> 01:20:07,586
You mentioned "yanomakura"
unintentionally

1303
01:20:08,326 --> 01:20:10,846
I remember "yamakura"..

1304
01:20:10,996 --> 01:20:13,726
You are not talking about
Mrs. Yamakura

1305
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:15,086
You mean..
"Yanomakura"

1306
01:20:15,226 --> 01:20:21,096
The second section of the left thumb
used to hold the arrows

1307
01:20:21,306 --> 01:20:23,796
I think you wanted to say that..

1308
01:20:23,936 --> 01:20:24,783
I remember..

1309
01:20:24,807 --> 01:20:29,006
Ms. Tika Suzu
hurt her yanomakura

1310
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:33,946
Only the professionals
use this term

1311
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:36,916
By the way..
Mr. Ryuen is an outsiders

1312
01:20:37,056 --> 01:20:39,616
He can't even pronounce accurately

1313
01:20:41,686 --> 01:20:45,246
Ryuen and I
practice swordcraft at the same place

1314
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:47,256
Because of that..
Someday

1315
01:20:47,396 --> 01:20:51,166
I learned an ancient school
called "Yoshitune School"

1316
01:20:51,296 --> 01:20:54,496
and I started to study it

1317
01:20:54,636 --> 01:20:57,396
I quit the practice
2 years ago

1318
01:20:57,536 --> 01:21:00,906
and claimed to be the heir
of Yoshitune School

1319
01:21:01,046 --> 01:21:03,276
Benkei is the founder
of Yoshitune School

1320
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:07,746
Compared with Benkei..
I think I like it more

1321
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:09,846
I wanna be a part of it

1322
01:21:11,086 --> 01:21:14,076
But the title was always taken away

1323
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:19,886
The leader of the robbery ring
was given the name of Benkei

1324
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:23,826
Were you in need of money?

1325
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:26,666
Right..
I didn't do it for personal desire

1326
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:29,766
I wanted to build a school
in Kyoto

1327
01:21:29,906 --> 01:21:32,706
And the leader was the master
of the temple

1328
01:21:32,836 --> 01:21:36,406
and he administered the temple
after it was abandoned

1329
01:21:36,546 --> 01:21:40,376
That's why I use this place
as a practice place

1330
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:43,206
3 months ago..the leader died

1331
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,846
And the temple
has to be dismantled

1332
01:21:45,986 --> 01:21:49,446
I can't use it anymore

1333
01:21:49,586 --> 01:21:51,586
I have a question

1334
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:54,356
You are just using Mr. Ryuen

1335
01:21:54,496 --> 01:21:55,466
Right

1336
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:58,256
I heard him talk about the statue

1337
01:21:58,396 --> 01:22:01,066
After I mailed the letter

1338
01:22:01,206 --> 01:22:03,606
As I have expected
he came to talk to me

1339
01:22:03,736 --> 01:22:09,306
So I advised him to
ask Mouri for help

1340
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:13,136
Even if I don't count on him

1341
01:22:13,276 --> 01:22:15,836
I can find a buyer

1342
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:20,076
Because it's very easy to do it
on the Internet

1343
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:22,846
Alright..the chat is over

1344
01:22:22,986 --> 01:22:25,356
Please hand me the crystal

1345
01:22:25,596 --> 01:22:27,496
No problem
but you have to let Kazuha go

1346
01:22:27,626 --> 01:22:28,716
No problem

1347
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:31,596
If you tell me
where the statue is

1348
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:32,626
What?

1349
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:35,566
Where is the statue?

1350
01:22:35,906 --> 01:22:37,426
It's in the temple

1351
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:38,566
What are you saying?

1352
01:22:38,706 --> 01:22:40,796
It's called..
people always forget the nearest

1353
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:41,966
Don't lie to me

1354
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:43,976
I have searched the whole temple

1355
01:22:44,116 --> 01:22:44,766
I just can't find you

1356
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,436
I am not lying to you

1357
01:23:02,366 --> 01:23:03,696
Kazuha..run now

1358
01:23:04,766 --> 01:23:05,426
Heiji

1359
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:26,186
They are my favorite disciples

1360
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:27,916
Don't get involved

1361
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:35,356
Heiji

1362
01:23:39,466 --> 01:23:42,066
Stop..this is not Heiji

1363
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:52,106
You..who are you?

1364
01:23:52,516 --> 01:23:54,206
Who are you?

1365
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:56,986
I am Kudo Shinichi

1366
01:23:58,656 --> 01:23:59,876
I am a detective

1367
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:01,186
What?

1368
01:24:01,886 --> 01:24:02,786
What are you talking about?

1369
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:05,416
You made him swallow the pill?

1370
01:24:05,556 --> 01:24:08,326
Because Kudo called
and asked if

1371
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:12,486
there's any way to restore him
even just for a short moment

1372
01:24:12,866 --> 01:24:17,926
But the anti-poison of APTX 4869
is out

1373
01:24:18,076 --> 01:24:22,336
The Bakanya that restored him

1374
01:24:22,476 --> 01:24:24,736
has lost its effects
because of the generation of antibodies

1375
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:27,206
It occurs to me..

1376
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:31,446
If you take some medicine
that gives you symptoms of colds

1377
01:24:31,586 --> 01:24:33,886
and drink Bakanya

1378
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:38,856
Maybe you can restore
your body again

1379
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:40,646
So..he..

1380
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,426
As I have expected
the experiment worked

1381
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:47,536
Kudo is restored

1382
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:50,296
But he's like having a terrible cold

1383
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:51,766
He's very weak

1384
01:24:51,906 --> 01:24:53,776
I can't guarantee
he will be safe..

1385
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:56,136
How about Heiji now?

1386
01:24:56,276 --> 01:24:57,106
I don't know

1387
01:24:57,246 --> 01:25:00,946
Before the future check-up
he has to take a rest

1388
01:25:01,086 --> 01:25:04,246
I'm assigned to
take care of him

1389
01:25:12,396 --> 01:25:13,386
Kudo..

1390
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:18,966
Damn..
How can he lie to me

1391
01:25:29,076 --> 01:25:31,376
I wanted to let her
escape here first

1392
01:25:31,516 --> 01:25:33,206
But now I can't make any move

1393
01:25:36,586 --> 01:25:39,886
Damn.. Bakanya has lost its effect

1394
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:43,086
I'll be dead

1395
01:25:45,626 --> 01:25:48,386
Maybe you can be the best detective

1396
01:25:48,996 --> 01:25:50,466
but if you'd like to be a warrior

1397
01:25:50,996 --> 01:25:52,626
You're way to far..

1398
01:25:52,766 --> 01:25:53,526
Hattori

1399
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:54,536
Heiji

1400
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,226
Sorry for the waiting..Kazuha

1401
01:25:56,636 --> 01:25:58,626
You..
You are such a big idiot

1402
01:25:58,776 --> 01:26:00,106
Why are you here now?

1403
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:04,336
Hey, Kudo

1404
01:26:06,116 --> 01:26:08,106
How dare you steal my clothes

1405
01:26:08,586 --> 01:26:09,446
And..

1406
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:11,676
I don't know
what you apply to your face

1407
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:13,916
But I don't have such a dark skin

1408
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,076
Really?

1409
01:26:15,356 --> 01:26:16,186
Forget it

1410
01:26:16,326 --> 01:26:19,086
Let me handle it
Go now

1411
01:26:19,226 --> 01:26:21,696
Hide yourself first

1412
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,916
And come back again
after you're restored

1413
01:26:27,406 --> 01:26:28,266
Stop right there

1414
01:26:28,406 --> 01:26:30,236
I am your rival

1415
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:33,466
Kazuha

1416
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:35,806
Don't tell anyone
about seeing Kudo

1417
01:26:36,146 --> 01:26:37,376
Even that girl

1418
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:38,566
Eh? Even Ran?

1419
01:26:38,716 --> 01:26:39,546
Why?

1420
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:41,346
There's no reason

1421
01:26:41,486 --> 01:26:43,576
They won't meet

1422
01:26:43,716 --> 01:26:45,206
It's better not to tell her

1423
01:26:49,886 --> 01:26:52,416
You can't go back alive

1424
01:26:56,166 --> 01:26:57,786
What the hell is it?

1425
01:27:01,836 --> 01:27:02,636
Chase him

1426
01:27:06,836 --> 01:27:07,826
Hey..you find him?

1427
01:27:08,106 --> 01:27:09,036
Not yet

1428
01:27:09,176 --> 01:27:10,146
Carry on

1429
01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:12,006
Eh..what's going on?

1430
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:15,846
Hush..don't make any noise
Don't move

1431
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:28,626
Shinichi

1432
01:27:28,926 --> 01:27:31,986
You look like before

1433
01:27:33,566 --> 01:27:35,196
What's wrong with you?

1434
01:27:35,466 --> 01:27:37,066
Why do you sweat so much?

1435
01:27:37,306 --> 01:27:40,466
Who are they?

1436
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:45,976
Where have they been?

1437
01:27:46,116 --> 01:27:47,446
I have no choice..
Let's go back first

1438
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:50,846
I'm sorry..Ran

1439
01:27:50,986 --> 01:27:52,546
I can't..

1440
01:28:12,276 --> 01:28:14,176
It's locked..
I can't open it

1441
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:15,466
Do something

1442
01:28:15,946 --> 01:28:17,346
This smells like "Tata-mi"

1443
01:28:17,746 --> 01:28:19,676
This is the room
where I was imprisoned

1444
01:28:21,946 --> 01:28:23,816
Get me the axe..quick

1445
01:28:23,956 --> 01:28:27,046
Damn..they will break in

1446
01:28:27,626 --> 01:28:30,216
Is there any weapon?

1447
01:28:33,866 --> 01:28:37,356
What?
Why are there so many drawers

1448
01:28:39,666 --> 01:28:41,156
The knife was put
in Benkei's drawer

1449
01:28:41,306 --> 01:28:43,736
And the arrows
in Rokaku's

1450
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:46,996
Heiji..
the knife is in Benkei's drawer

1451
01:28:47,146 --> 01:28:49,506
What?
In this drawer?

1452
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:54,876
But there are so many
I don't know which is his

1453
01:29:04,696 --> 01:29:07,126
I have seen it before

1454
01:29:08,766 --> 01:29:12,126
The alignment of the drawers
is like the roads in Kyoto

1455
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,476
I see

1456
01:29:21,846 --> 01:29:24,966
These are Karasuma Road
and Sanyashi Road

1457
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:27,116
Wait

1458
01:29:27,246 --> 01:29:31,016
Do they give each drawer a name?

1459
01:29:31,316 --> 01:29:32,346
Name?

1460
01:29:34,656 --> 01:29:35,416
Right

1461
01:29:35,986 --> 01:29:37,686
Like Rokakku..
is Rokaku's Hall

1462
01:29:38,496 --> 01:29:40,586
Benkei's drawer..

1463
01:29:42,826 --> 01:29:44,296
means Benkei's stone

1464
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,826
Going east from Santo Fuwutin

1465
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:48,126
This is the ball song

1466
01:29:48,266 --> 01:29:51,496
Marutakeebisuni..

1467
01:29:52,006 --> 01:29:56,106
Marutakeebisuni..
and then..

1468
01:29:58,076 --> 01:29:59,476
Damn..I can't remember

1469
01:29:59,616 --> 01:30:03,486
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

1470
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:07,986
Bride Rokakku..
Takonishiki

1471
01:30:08,126 --> 01:30:10,456
Heiji..Santo is 2 layers
above the Takonishiki

1472
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:11,426
Alright

1473
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:12,686
2 layers above Takonishiki

1474
01:30:12,826 --> 01:30:14,126
And the west-east road is..

1475
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:15,986
Temple..Yushin..
Fuwu..Fu..

1476
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:17,596
Fuwutin is the 3rd

1477
01:30:17,796 --> 01:30:18,526
Right here

1478
01:30:21,206 --> 01:30:22,166
Die now

1479
01:30:38,816 --> 01:30:41,816
The unique pattern
on both sides

1480
01:30:42,226 --> 01:30:43,886
This is the evil knife

1481
01:30:46,326 --> 01:30:49,026
Using it to deal with
the devil on Yoshitune

1482
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,226
is the best idea

1483
01:30:51,366 --> 01:30:52,096
What are you talking about?

1484
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,526
Go away

1485
01:31:01,276 --> 01:31:02,336
What are you doing?

1486
01:31:02,476 --> 01:31:03,606
Chase him

1487
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:04,476
Yes

1488
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:10,176
Listen..
I'll delay them

1489
01:31:10,316 --> 01:31:12,116
You'd better run now

1490
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,716
NO..I wanna be with you

1491
01:31:14,856 --> 01:31:16,376
Be good

1492
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:18,016
Heiji

1493
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:19,026
We have found it

1494
01:31:19,726 --> 01:31:20,916
Run now

1495
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:28,536
Go get that girl

1496
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:29,296
Yes

1497
01:31:40,476 --> 01:31:41,346
Conan

1498
01:31:41,486 --> 01:31:44,046
Kazuha..how about Heiji?

1499
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,356
He's over there

1500
01:31:49,856 --> 01:31:50,826
Heiji

1501
01:31:56,026 --> 01:31:57,016
Damn

1502
01:31:57,166 --> 01:32:00,186
I wanna call the police
but there's no reception

1503
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:02,596
You can use this

1504
01:32:19,686 --> 01:32:21,176
Hey..go put out the fire

1505
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:22,416
Yes

1506
01:32:24,596 --> 01:32:27,156
Alright..
I hope someone has spotted the fire

1507
01:32:27,826 --> 01:32:30,096
Hey..Ran

1508
01:32:32,866 --> 01:32:33,996
Are you awake?

1509
01:32:34,306 --> 01:32:35,426
Father

1510
01:32:38,206 --> 01:32:39,506
Where is Shinichi?

1511
01:32:39,876 --> 01:32:41,276
You fainted?

1512
01:32:41,706 --> 01:32:43,366
Why is that guy here?

1513
01:32:43,846 --> 01:32:46,776
Why are you sleeping here?

1514
01:32:47,046 --> 01:32:49,246
Why are you here then?

1515
01:32:49,386 --> 01:32:50,746
I informed him

1516
01:32:51,056 --> 01:32:53,716
Kazuha was kidnapped
by Genzihatoru

1517
01:32:53,856 --> 01:32:54,546
Mr. Mouri

1518
01:33:08,936 --> 01:33:11,526
It's time for a fight

1519
01:33:14,076 --> 01:33:15,266
As I wish

1520
01:33:21,186 --> 01:33:23,016
I won't be trapped again

1521
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,946
How about this?

1522
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:27,776
Knife?

1523
01:33:28,156 --> 01:33:30,286
This is not an ordinary one

1524
01:33:30,426 --> 01:33:33,116
There's poison on it

1525
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:35,196
What are you saying?

1526
01:33:35,326 --> 01:33:37,956
If you're cut
you'll die immediately

1527
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:41,966
What a wicked guy

1528
01:34:08,926 --> 01:34:10,556
Damn..
Heiji is in danger

1529
01:34:10,696 --> 01:34:12,526
You have nowhere to run

1530
01:34:12,866 --> 01:34:15,296
The arrows are aimed at you

1531
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:22,106
You have to figure it out

1532
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:24,076
Conan

1533
01:34:24,216 --> 01:34:24,836
Don't run

1534
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,606
Hey..I am here

1535
01:34:46,266 --> 01:34:47,196
Look

1536
01:34:55,676 --> 01:34:57,106
Go..Heiji

1537
01:34:57,246 --> 01:34:58,036
Heiji

1538
01:35:26,576 --> 01:35:29,066
You want to be Benkei?

1539
01:35:29,406 --> 01:35:31,006
If you were Benkei

1540
01:35:31,146 --> 01:35:33,946
Yoshitune would've been killed
at the checkpoint

1541
01:35:34,586 --> 01:35:36,176
The master is defeated

1542
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:53,366
Arrest them

1543
01:35:53,496 --> 01:35:54,296
Yes

1544
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,966
Great..Conan

1545
01:35:56,106 --> 01:35:56,826
Yes..

1546
01:35:57,306 --> 01:36:00,636
Didn't you call Heiji
by "Hattori"?

1547
01:36:00,776 --> 01:36:02,936
I'm sorry..I was too excited

1548
01:36:03,346 --> 01:36:04,306
It's Heiji

1549
01:36:04,576 --> 01:36:05,806
Heiji

1550
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:10,806
This temple..

1551
01:36:20,626 --> 01:36:22,686
Now all the puzzles are solved

1552
01:36:25,936 --> 01:36:30,266
And the medical effect
is only temporary

1553
01:36:30,406 --> 01:36:34,496
Thanks for letting me
gather so much information

1554
01:36:36,476 --> 01:36:38,066
Are you okay, Heiji?

1555
01:36:38,216 --> 01:36:39,196
I am fine

1556
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:42,246
But where is the statue?

1557
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:48,616
Heiji..Shinichi is..

1558
01:36:49,726 --> 01:36:50,556
What..

1559
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:52,656
Nothing

1560
01:36:53,896 --> 01:36:56,456
It was just a dream

1561
01:37:19,556 --> 01:37:21,316
(Sannouzi Temple)

1562
01:37:21,526 --> 01:37:23,216
It's really embarrassing

1563
01:37:23,356 --> 01:37:25,916
I can't find where the statue is

1564
01:37:26,056 --> 01:37:30,626
Don't blame yourself
it's up to the fate

1565
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:32,786
Never mind

1566
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:35,666
Please be careful

1567
01:37:37,876 --> 01:37:38,966
Goodbye

1568
01:37:45,946 --> 01:37:48,536
It's really troublesome now

1569
01:37:48,746 --> 01:37:52,046
It's only one hour left

1570
01:37:52,356 --> 01:37:53,816
Don't worry

1571
01:37:53,956 --> 01:37:55,786
We'll inform the faithfuls

1572
01:38:03,866 --> 01:38:06,226
The Medicine Buddha

1573
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:08,826
The Buddha is back

1574
01:38:10,906 --> 01:38:13,096
(Yuryu Temple, During the Dawn)

1575
01:38:19,946 --> 01:38:21,246
We found it..Kudo

1576
01:38:21,516 --> 01:38:23,346
Am I right?

1577
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:30,316
The shape of the temple
is like the Chinese character "Â§"

1578
01:38:30,626 --> 01:38:33,056
And the point refers to
this clock tower

1579
01:38:34,526 --> 01:38:37,296
I didn't perceive that either

1580
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:41,396
With a "Â§" on top of it
it becomes "Â§"

1581
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,226
which implies the "roof"

1582
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,866
I see

1583
01:38:54,116 --> 01:38:55,846
So now it's returned
to the original owner

1584
01:38:56,116 --> 01:38:56,806
Yes

1585
01:39:00,616 --> 01:39:03,856
They are the best partners

1586
01:39:03,986 --> 01:39:07,156
Just like Yoshitune and Benkei

1587
01:39:08,866 --> 01:39:12,026
You mean Heiji and Mouri?

1588
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:15,326
You are not mature enough

1589
01:39:20,236 --> 01:39:21,466
What do you mean?

1590
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:27,676
Alright..Ayumi will be the next

1591
01:39:27,816 --> 01:39:28,786
Alright

1592
01:39:29,286 --> 01:39:30,946
So cute

1593
01:39:31,256 --> 01:39:32,946
I'll take it back

1594
01:39:33,086 --> 01:39:34,176
No

1595
01:39:34,316 --> 01:39:36,486
Because it's my best friend

1596
01:39:36,726 --> 01:39:40,716
Mr. Captain
You don't have many friends

1597
01:39:41,466 --> 01:39:45,956
Sorry for suspecting you
to be the criminals

1598
01:39:46,096 --> 01:39:47,466
That's alright

1599
01:39:47,596 --> 01:39:50,726
I knew my father

1600
01:39:50,866 --> 01:39:54,736
I asked him
to stop mailing me money

1601
01:39:55,006 --> 01:39:56,806
Your father?

1602
01:39:56,946 --> 01:39:58,066
Who is he?

1603
01:39:58,416 --> 01:39:59,606
This is a secret

1604
01:40:04,686 --> 01:40:08,486
That nasty monk

1605
01:40:10,256 --> 01:40:14,626
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

1606
01:40:14,766 --> 01:40:16,456
Bride Rokakku

1607
01:40:16,596 --> 01:40:19,326
Not bride..but sister
Idiot

1608
01:40:19,466 --> 01:40:21,796
Where did you learn this song?

1609
01:40:21,936 --> 01:40:24,426
I learned it from my relative
in Kyoto

1610
01:40:24,576 --> 01:40:27,266
I remember
when I was in the 3rd year

1611
01:40:27,406 --> 01:40:30,466
We learned it together

1612
01:40:30,606 --> 01:40:31,506
With me?

1613
01:40:31,646 --> 01:40:33,506
What?
You don't remember?

1614
01:40:33,646 --> 01:40:37,246
I remember now..
You were so impatient

1615
01:40:37,386 --> 01:40:41,116
You wanted to go to Sannouzi
and then you went out

1616
01:40:41,256 --> 01:40:44,686
At that time
my relative helped me wear Kimono

1617
01:40:44,826 --> 01:40:48,256
and hair dressings..makeup

1618
01:40:48,396 --> 01:40:51,326
I went to Sannouzi
to look for you

1619
01:40:51,466 --> 01:40:54,696
Because I couldn't see you
I left soon

1620
01:40:55,636 --> 01:40:58,666
I'd like to show you
the scene I saw at that time

1621
01:40:58,806 --> 01:41:01,966
The blossoms were scattered
everywhere

1622
01:41:02,546 --> 01:41:07,706
Marutakeebisuni
Oshioike

1623
01:41:07,846 --> 01:41:13,256
Bride Rokaku..Takonishiki

1624
01:41:17,726 --> 01:41:20,056
That means..
Finally I can see you

1625
01:41:20,426 --> 01:41:22,086
See me?

1626
01:41:22,226 --> 01:41:24,356
Heiji you saw your first lover?

1627
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,866
Who is she?
The dancer?

1628
01:41:26,996 --> 01:41:29,726
I won't tell you..idiot

1629
01:41:29,866 --> 01:41:30,766
It doesn't matter..stingy guy

1630
01:41:30,906 --> 01:41:31,696
Tell me please

1631
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:32,496
Eh..

1632
01:41:32,636 --> 01:41:35,366
I'll tell you
in another 1 500 years

1633
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:37,706
Come on

1634
01:41:50,286 --> 01:41:52,686
Conan..what are you doing?

1635
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:58,996
Why do you sweat so much?

1636
01:42:00,266 --> 01:42:02,526
Shin..Shinichi

1637
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:07,166
By the way..
I called Shinichi

1638
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:11,136
I wanted him to disguise himself
as Heiji and save Kazuha

1639
01:42:11,276 --> 01:42:11,836
Right?

1640
01:42:11,976 --> 01:42:16,976
Yes..
but that guy is really vulnerable

1641
01:42:17,116 --> 01:42:19,176
He escaped half way

1642
01:42:19,516 --> 01:42:22,516
Didn't you tell me
not to tell anyone?

1643
01:42:25,856 --> 01:42:26,726
I see

1644
01:42:27,326 --> 01:42:31,026
So that was Shinichi?

1645
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:35,726
Finally I see you

1646
01:46:54,756 --> 01:46:56,126
I'd like ice cream

1647
01:46:56,266 --> 01:46:58,666
Alright..it's 300 yens

1648
01:47:00,036 --> 01:47:03,836
I am the only one
who hasn't met the special someone

1649
01:47:03,966 --> 01:47:07,836
Sonako..
you will see Kyogoku someday

1650
01:47:07,976 --> 01:47:13,416
I'm not good at waiting

1651
01:47:13,546 --> 01:47:14,916
So is Ran

1652
01:47:15,046 --> 01:47:19,676
Come on..
I don't dislike it

1653
01:47:19,816 --> 01:47:24,656
Because the longer I wait
when we meet..

1654
01:47:28,096 --> 01:47:30,856
You look like before..

1655
01:47:31,488 --> 01:47:32,858
we will feel more delighted

1656
01:47:33,366 --> 01:47:34,666
Ah..damn

1657
01:47:34,728 --> 01:47:38,559
I hope Kudo could hear about what she just said.
