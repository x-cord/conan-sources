1
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:21,250
Uh... Today at around a little after 21:50...

2
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,208
the National Tokyo Microorganism
Research Center in Nishi Tama City

3
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,667
was attacked by
a group of seven armed men...

4
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,750
The armed group captured two security guards

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,500
and took the researcher
who is on duty hostage,

6
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,167
(Tadayoshi Uno Chief Commission Councilor)
and made it into the high security lab.

7
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,458
(Toshiro Odagiri Chief Commission Detective)
A few minutes later,

8
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,500
after exploding the plastic bomb
that they set up,

9
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,375
they fled the site.

10
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,667
Counselor! Excuse us!

11
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,542
In the lab that was bombed

12
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:51,000
it is assumed that
some very dangerous bacteria was stored,

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,750
and that it was taken away by the culprits.

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,167
Dangerous bacteria?!

15
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,750
It is said that if infected by this bacteria,
there's an 80% chance of death,

16
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,750
and moreover,
no antidote for it has been found yet.

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,917
Could the bacteria have leaked out
to nearby areas due to the explosion?

18
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,417
No.

19
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,792
The chief of the research center
has testified that

20
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,917
since the scope of the explosion was large,

21
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,917
even if there were to have been
any bacteria remaining,

22
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,208
they would have perished to ashes.

23
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,542
What is the purpose of the group?

24
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,792
We don't know yet...

25
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,500
But, we are also taking into consideration
the possibility of bio-terrorism.

26
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,083
I would like to make a request to all of you.

27
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,958
In order to avoid needless panic,

28
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,167
we would like you to limit your report
to this being a case of a bomb explosion

29
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:38,750
and refrain from mentioning anything
about the bacteria,

30
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,333
or the possibility of this
being an act of bio-terrorism.

31
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,000
You mean you're censoring the press?

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,875
Hello...

33
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,333
Hello.

34
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,542
Chief!

35
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,833
It seems that the culprit group

36
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,625
declared their action on the internet!

37
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,875
Moreover, they are calling themselves by

38
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,208
the name of the terrorist group
Red Siamese Cat...

39
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,833
We, the Red Siamese Cat

40
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,458
have attacked the
National Tokyo Microorganism Research Center,

41
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,958
and have gotten hold of a killer bacteria.

42
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,583
We will be doing the following things
in the next 7 days.

43
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,167
Prepare yourselves for it...

44
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,208
So, the bacteria was taken away after all...

45
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,375
But, didn't the Red Siamese Cat

46
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,292
perish 10 years ago...

47
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,208
Chief!

48
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,875
So, we're not going to be censored anymore,
are we?!

49
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,167
It can't be helped...

50
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,000
All right!

51
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,958
So, today we have with us here,

52
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,625
scholar of bacteriology, Ms. Chiaki Ota.

53
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,583
(Chiaki Fujimoto, bacteria specialist)
If infected by this bacteria,

54
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,000
a rash accompanied by itching will appear.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,417
What a terrible thing they've done...

56
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,417
(Bacteria invasion)

57
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,583
This is the only news that has been aired
since this morning...

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,958
The body will become weak
and eventually death is inevitable.

59
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,583
It spreads mainly from being
sprayed with the bacteria.

60
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,583
Little children are especially susceptible
and will catch it easily.

61
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,875
Characteristically,
symptoms will appear almost immediately.

62
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,250
So they say. What now?

63
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,708
Since you've turned into a little child,
Conan?

64
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,792
Leave me alone.

65
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,875
More than that Heiji.

66
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,208
What bothers me is...

67
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:16,333
Why the culprit group
exploded the lab, right?

68
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,583
If their purpose was
to get away with the bacteria,

69
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,083
they didn't have to explode the place.

70
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,250
True...

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,667
By the way,

72
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,000
did you know about the organization
called Red Siamese Cat?

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,042
No...

74
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,292
only that 10 years ago,

75
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,792
they used to target rich people
and repeat terrorist activities...

76
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:36,375
Well, we were both still kids then too...

77
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,083
Oh, I'm sorry, so sorry.

78
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,875
It slipped my mind
that you're still a kid, Conan.

79
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,083
How rude.

80
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,792
By the way, Kudo,

81
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,708
you told me that you were going to
board a blimp, didn't you?

82
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,250
Yeah... on the one that will fly
from Tokyo to Osaka... ,

83
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,542
(Largest Zeppelin built)

84
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,208
because that old man slammed a letter

85
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,875
of challenge at Thief Kid again...

86
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,958
(Attention the Kaito Kid thief!)

87
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,125
A letter of acceptance seems to have arrived
from him a while ago too...

88
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,458
So, I'm sure that the old man is...

89
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,708
How dare those Red Stray cats!!

90
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,333
To take my news of the world's best blimp

91
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,417
that I had completed with me being
the center of the project,

92
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,583
off the first page headlines!!

93
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,250
Thanks to them, the letter of challenge
that I received from my arch rival Thief Kid

94
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,958
has also lost its grandeur!!

95
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,917
Then, Kudo.

96
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,083
why don't sleep over
at my house at that time.

97
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,667
I'll take you to the okonomiyaki shop
that I promised to take you to.

98
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,333
Okay, I got it, See you.

99
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,250
Beep.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,750
(The Lost Ship in the Sky)

101
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,958
I'm high school detective Shinichi Kudo.

102
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,958
I went to the amusement park

103
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,500
with my childhood friend and classmate Ran.

104
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,667
When I witnessed suspicious looking men
in black making a deal.

105
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,792
I was so absorbed in watching the deal

106
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,792
that I didn't notice one of the men
approaching me from behind at all.

107
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,750
I was forced to drink poison by that man

108
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,833
and when I woke up...

109
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,542
my body was shrunk!!

110
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,042
If those guys find out
that Shinichi Kudo is alive

111
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,458
they would come after me again,

112
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,750
and moreover, endanger the lives
of the people around me too

113
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,833
Through advice from Dr. Agasa,
I decided to hide my true identity.

114
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,708
So, when Ran asked me for my name

115
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,667
I answered Conan Edogawa,

116
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,417
and made up my mind to free load at her house

117
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,875
where her father runs a detective agency

118
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,833
in order to gather information on the guys.

119
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:49,042
One, two, three, four, two, three, four!

120
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,875
Jirokichi Suzuki, 72 years old...

121
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,833
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,583
Thank you very much!

123
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,750
He is Ran's best friend Sonoko's Dad's cousin

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,875
as well as the advisor
for the Suzuki Financial Group.

125
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,208
He received all the awards he desired,

126
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,042
and realized all the dreams
he had wished for,

127
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,333
is what this proud old man always says...

128
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,250
He is currently
putting his entire heart and soul

129
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,833
into his confrontation with Thief Kid...

130
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,250
But, my concern is those guys...

131
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
The terrorists who bombed the laboratory

132
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,542
and fled with dangerous bacteria...

133
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,250
What is their purpose...?

134
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,958
I may have shrunk
but my brains remain the same.

135
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,000
No case remains unsolved
with Detective Conan.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,417
There is just one and only truth!!

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,667
Wow, it's Tropical Land.

138
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,042
The castle looks small!

139
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,083
It looks like a toy amusement park!

140
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,083
Fantastic scenery, fantastic...

141
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,250
Dad, the scenery is great!

142
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,292
Uh, why don't you come over here and look?

143
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,250
Shut up!
I'm thinking of something right now!!

144
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,375
-Oh boy...
-Come to think of it,

145
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,250
you're not at home with high places,
are you, Mr. Mouri?

146
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,667
That's not it!!

147
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,125
Uh, I wonder if Thief Kid
is always looking at scenery like this?

148
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,917
I envy him.

149
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,167
I wonder though, is Thief Kid really coming?

150
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,583
He will!

151
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,333
Because Uncle Jirokichi received a letter
of reply from him...

152
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,125
See!

153
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,958
HE NO GO N DE 0 KESHIMASU?

154
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,708
What's with you reading
just the words you can read!

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
I tell you...

156
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,417
Here goes, okay?

157
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,708
Thank you for inviting me
on board your blimp.

158
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,583
I happily accept it.

159
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,708
However, considering that
you are already 72 years old,

160
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,500
it hurts me to think that
I'll be keeping you tense for 6 hours, so...

161
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,625
I'll go to get it after sundown

162
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,542
just when the blimp passes over
the skies of Osaka City.

163
00:08:56,542 --> 00:09:00,417
Until then, please enjoy your pleasure flight
to your heart's content.

164
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,208
Thief Kid...

165
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,708
Oh~ how I wish he would come to get me too,

166
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,542
Thief Kid

167
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,500
I used to think so from before,

168
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
but she sure has a unique personality...

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,125
W, Well. I guess so...

170
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,583
By the way,

171
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,542
are we the only passengers on this flight?

172
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm sure that a writer of reports
called Mr. Fujioka is on board...

173
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,750
O, Oh, that's him...

174
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,833
(Takamichi Fujioka, freelance writer)
He said he wanted to write a report

175
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,042
on the confrontation of
Thief Kid and Uncle Jirokichi..

176
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,750
He came from his side and sold himself...

177
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,167
-The others are...
-Uh, excuse me...

178
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,875
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

179
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,292
How do you do?

180
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,833
(Masaki Mizukawa, producer of Nisai TV)
I'm Mizukawa, director of Nichiuri TV.

181
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,000
And they are reporter Kasumi Nishitani

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,667
and cameraman Junpei Ishimoto.

183
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,458
Hello, nice to meet you.

184
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,875
Oh, same here...

185
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,417
We've been exclusively chosen
to broadcast live the confrontation

186
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:58,458
between Mr. Suzuki and Thief Kid this time...

187
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,375
Oh... you're going to be airing a special
from sundown today...

188
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,708
Yes...

189
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,917
We wanted to put our all
into airing the program

190
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,750
like we did some time back
when we broadcast the mid air walk,

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,583
but, unfortunately, the timing was bad...

192
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,833
Timing?...

193
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,333
On the Red Siamese Cat...

194
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,458
Yes...

195
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,167
ever since they warned of the things
they'll be doing within the next 7 days,

196
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,000
our station is prepared
for any type of emergency...

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,833
If they go according as planned,
today's the deadline...

198
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,625
Phooey! Thanks to them

199
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,625
the flight permit
that I needed to fly the helicopter

200
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,917
for my autobiography wasn't granted...

201
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,458
I tell you
I hate those good-for-nothing cats,

202
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,583
right, Lupin.

203
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,833
Uncle Jirokichi...

204
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,542
Hello, hello, advisor Suzuki.

205
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,125
I'm looking forward to today.

206
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,292
My, what a fantastic blimp.

207
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,333
Phooey!
You're broadcasting that fantastic blimp

208
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,583
and all you have is a staff of three...

209
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, well...

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,042
Thanks to that incident,

211
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,875
you already know about,
the station's hands are tied...

212
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,125
But,

213
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,833
I wonder what those culprits
are planning to do with the bacteria...

214
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,875
Right, right,

215
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,583
if anyone catches it
there's almost no chance of staying alive...

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
I hear that you can catch it

217
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,000
if the bacteria is sprayed in the air
or something...

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,625
It sure is frightening

219
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,708
The bacteria's going to be sprayed in air?

220
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
No sprayed.

221
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,333
It means that it's contagious
and can be caught

222
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,958
if someone infected
with it sneezes or coughs.

223
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,250
Children seem to be especially
susceptible to it,

224
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,583
so you should be careful.

225
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,875
What...

226
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,083
No sweat.

227
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,667
I don't know
if it's some killer bacteria or what but,

228
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:33,833
I came from a place that's filled with germs,

229
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,250
but see, I'm alive and kicking.

230
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,125
Humans are way stronger than bacteria.

231
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,458
Right.

232
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,417
But then,

233
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:45,250
kids like you may go just like that, though.

234
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,583
Please stop it!

235
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,208
Please stop saying things
that will scare the children!!

236
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,500
Right! Talk about insensitive!!

237
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,542
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. no sweat, no sweat.

238
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,583
No problem.

239
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,875
No matter
where in Japan the bacteria is scattered,

240
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,667
as long as we're on board the blimp,
we'll be fine,

241
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,875
don't worry!

242
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,417
That's only if you keep on flying...

243
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,500
Isn't it about time
we prepare for tea service?

244
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,917
Yep, but let me take a quick puff
before that.

245
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,208
I'll be right back.

246
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,583
So, you can't figure out
who the culprits are after all...

247
00:12:55,583 --> 00:13:00,083
Yes, the higher ups of the Red Siamese Cat
that are serving sentence now

248
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,750
insist that they have no idea
what's going on...

249
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,667
For now,
the only clue that we have is that ampule,

250
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,667
but it's not one that's been made by

251
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,000
any manufacturer domestically
or outside of Japan.

252
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,292
It's probably an original
that was made by the Red Siamse Cat.

253
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,625
The fact that the ampule was found

254
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,958
in the parking lot of the research center
means that...

255
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,292
there is a high probability that

256
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:24,250
the culprits brought several empty ampules
into the research center.

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,625
Then, they put the bacteria
that was stored in the lab

258
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,667
into the ampules and took them outside.

259
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,583
And they mistakenly dropped

260
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,750
one of the empty ampules...

261
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,792
Yes,

262
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:40,583
inserting the bacteria into another container
is extremely difficult

263
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,458
and dangerous.

264
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,583
It is presumed that the culprit possesses
much scientific knowledge.

265
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,917
But, why didn't they
take the bacteria out as is,

266
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,042
rather than do something as dangerous as
to insert it into another container.

267
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,875
In the first place,

268
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,292
why did they suddenly appear like ghosts
after a period of 10 long years...

269
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,542
What on earth is their purpose...

270
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,458
Hey! There's a window over here too!!

271
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,917
They really seem to be having fun,
those children.

272
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,208
Hmm...

273
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,375
How lucky that they get to ride
a blimp despite being so young.

274
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,042
They should be grateful to Sonoko.

275
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,042
Because for them

276
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:26,250
it's just like riding a large cloud
that is afloat in the sky...

277
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,042
Oh, it's nothing...

278
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,250
I just sort of remembered some things back
when I was a child...

279
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,583
When Ran saw a blimp go through the sky
for the first time...

280
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,167
Shinichi!! Oh, no! Oh, no!!

281
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,708
It's a UFO! UFO's flying!!

282
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,917
UFO?

283
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,042
Well,

284
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,083
since a balloon monster like thing

285
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,167
was flying gracefully through the sky,

286
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,708
she was probably surprised
and thought so but...

287
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:53,958
Oh,

288
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,792
are you bragging about
your dear little princess?

289
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,083
I, I'm not bragging.

290
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,000
But,

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,667
you've appealed her feminine side
more than enough...

292
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,917
Even I'd like to ride a magic ship
that flies through the skie

293
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:11,500
and go to a dream land
that's above the clouds too...

294
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,500
... I'm just joking.

295
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,958
I, I thought so...

296
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,375
Everybody!!

297
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,625
Uncle Jirokichi says
he'll show us to the sky deck!

298
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,708
You'll get to see the Big Jewel!

299
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,292
All right!!

300
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,458
Treasure, treasure!!

301
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,500
Okay! Do you want to see the treasure?!

302
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,583
Aye!!

303
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,667
Let's go, then!!

304
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,917
Aye!!

305
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,292
Conan and Ai, let's go.

306
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:43,583
Well, all I can say is to keep
a firm grip on her

307
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,375
so that some Peter Pan
doesn't snatch her away from you

308
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,583
and take her off to dreamland.

309
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,333
Just what's she trying to say...

310
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,125
Doc...

311
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,208
That story about the UFO just a while ago,

312
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,458
don't tell Ran about it, okay.

313
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,958
I know.

314
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,167
Is everybody gathered?

315
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,125
Yes!

316
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,375
All right, I, Chief Stewart Sano

317
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,542
(Asano Mitsuhiro, Cockpit Captain)
will now show you to the sky deck.

318
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,625
Wow!

319
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,417
It's glass all around!

320
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,000
We get to see the inside of the blimp!

321
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,125
Okay, here we go!

322
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,333
It's so exciting.

323
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,333
-Yep.
-Everyone, don't be surprised.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,458
This Bell Tree #1

325
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,917
is 246 meters in length

326
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:42,000
and its maximum diameter is 42.2 meters.

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,458
In both length and diameter this blimp

328
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,125
is 1 meter larger than the famed Hindenburg.

329
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,167
It is literally the world's largest blimp.

330
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,625
Darn,

331
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,292
why does it have to be glass all around...?

332
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,500
and is equipped

333
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,000
with a computer controlled operation device
in the cockpit.

334
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,958
Huh?

335
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,583
Something that looks like a balloon
is wriggling

336
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,417
That's an air sac and

337
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,208
it's filled with helium gas.

338
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,500
It's just like the lungs of whales.

339
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,083
Really, it looks like it's alive.

340
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,083
It indeed feels like
we're moving up a whale's stomach...

341
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,042
Wow! It's so bright!

342
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,000
You can see the sky!!

343
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,292
It's the jewel!!

344
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,667
This is Advisor Suzuki's pride and joy...

345
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,917
the sky deck.

346
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,000
One part of the roof
can be opened and closed...

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,083
So, it's good for sunbathing,

348
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,333
or star viewing.

349
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,542
There are many ways to enjoy it,

350
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,375
but today I've rigged it a little bit

351
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,250
in order to capture him...

352
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,917
I wanna see the jewel!

353
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,750
It's not something for kids to look at!

354
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,000
What?! What's the problem?!

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,042
No!

356
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,542
Hey, you!!

357
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:08,667
You...

358
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,250
Inspector Nakamori...

359
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,875
Oh, Mr. Mouri, you too...

360
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,292
Let me introduce you...

361
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,625
Oh, wait...

362
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,708
That's the Lapis Lazuli

363
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,583
that's going to be used
to lure that guy over here today...

364
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,208
It's the big jewel, Lady Sky!

365
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,542
How beautiful.

366
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,875
This blue color is indescribable!

367
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,542
The gold particles are glittering!

368
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,458
They look like stars!

369
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,083
Out of all the golden particles
don't you think that the biggest one...

370
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,292
look like something?

371
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,792
Hmm... The biggest particle?

372
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,167
Oh, it looks like the face of a lady!!

373
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,125
Exactly,

374
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,875
that's how it got the name "Lady Sky!"

375
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,542
The natural philosopher

376
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,583
of the ancient Rome called Plinius
called this stone

377
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:58,000
"a piece from heaven
that shines as the stars... "

378
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,042
It is indeed a jewel that is worthy of

379
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,833
being display in this sky deck.

380
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,333
Phooey! Why do you have such a valuable piece

381
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,833
exhibited behind a mere plain glass case?

382
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,792
Oh... Inspector,

383
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:16,375
the bullet proof glass
that repels the bullets of a machine gun

384
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,042
and the iron wall device that won't open

385
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,333
unless my fingerprint
and the pass code matches

386
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,583
is beyond your comprehension?

387
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,542
Phooey... they're all of no use.

388
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,917
After all, even at the research center
where the bacteria was stolen

389
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:29,958
a similar kind of device was set up...

390
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,042
What happens if this is pushed?

391
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,958
Why don't you push it?

392
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,542
Like this.

393
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,583
Dad?!

394
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,750
That device wasn't rigged like this, was it?

395
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,750
Well, no...

396
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,833
W, What a thing to do you darn brat!!

397
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,125
Dad?!

398
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,917
I see... That sensor...

399
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,000
But, talk about full of problems...

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,667
It's true that

401
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,417
such a device wasn't attached but

402
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:16,167
what if he does this, then what?

403
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,542
If a gun is stuck out at you like this,

404
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,417
you've got no choice
but to open it using your finger, right?

405
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:26,917
Well, I don't believe
he'll do something like that,

406
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,500
but if he does...

407
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,833
In, Inspector Nakamori?!

408
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:39,042
Ha, ha, ha... in that event, I'll do this.

409
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:41,375
Don't tell me it fell into the sea?

410
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,250
No way.

411
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,250
Darn! What a device!!

412
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,875
Do you still call this a plain glass case?

413
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,833
I'm sure it was, 4, 7...

414
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,708
I see... That's what it is...

415
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,375
At any rate,
he's going to appear at sundown.

416
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,583
There's no need to keep guard over here
till then, is there?

417
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,458
Phooey!

418
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,417
We're going to re-think
the strategy downstairs!

419
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,917
-Let's go!!
-Yes, sir.

420
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,292
Well, what an interesting thing to watch.

421
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:25,083
Thanks to you
I'll be able to write a good report.

422
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,500
Excuse me,

423
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,208
please smoke in the smoking room on B-Deck.

424
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,083
Mr. Mouri, how about joining us?

425
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,250
No, I'll go rest in my room...

426
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,042
I don't have the slightest idea
what's going on...

427
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,625
Ha, ha, ha... that comes as no surprise...

428
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,042
Oh, what a relief...

429
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,500
Uncle sure had a hard time, didn't he?

430
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,458
Yep...

431
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,500
Oh, by the way,
that band-aid was good, wasn't it?

432
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,958
The band aid, band aid!

433
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,083
Haven't you used it yet?

434
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:06,792
Don't tell me...
you did something to the band aid?

435
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,000
Hey, just what is this?!

436
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,208
(Shinichi Love)

437
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,042
Heh, heh, heh... You like it?

438
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,083
I tell you, what's with you...

439
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,333
Oh no!

440
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,208
I gave some bandaids to the crew
when I boarded the ship!

441
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,917
Hurry, everybody!

442
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,083
Oops...

443
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,375
Take it easy little lady,

444
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,417
or it's dangerous.

445
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,458
Thank you...

446
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you very much.

447
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,958
No problem...

448
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,583
Oh, blood...

449
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,042
By your elbow...

450
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,500
Oh, maybe I scraped myself just now...

451
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,958
Wait.

452
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,375
Please use this.

453
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,333
Thank you.

454
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,667
What shall I do

455
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,625
if he thinks that I wrote it...

456
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,083
He won't notice it,

457
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,792
because the writing was so tiny anyway...

458
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:01,792
Oh, boy...

459
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:08,458
I guess I'll go take a look at
that jewel once more...

460
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,208
I didn't get a good look at it a while ago

461
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,792
because since there were
so many people there.

462
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:12,958
Oh...

463
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,333
I'll go to my room then,

464
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,875
because I promised to mail Makoto.

465
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,083
The thing about Thief Kid is a secret, okay

466
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,000
-See you later, then
-Yep.

467
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,333
I wonder who it is...?

468
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,208
Hello...

469
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,292
Hello... Uh...

470
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,083
Oh, I'm a waiter on the blimp...

471
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,042
I slipped away from my job

472
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:53,125
to go take look at the rumored jewel.

473
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,833
Oh... Oops.
Oh no, I gotta go back to work...

474
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,292
Enjoy yourself, bye...

475
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,708
Oh, thank you...

476
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,375
Please wait!

477
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,667
W, what is it?

478
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,583
That band-aid...

479
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,583
Oh, I burned myself a bit just a while ago.

480
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,750
No joke!!

481
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,167
It, It's no joke.

482
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:21,042
Then take a better look at the band-aid!

483
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,208
Shoots!

484
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,875
How come you have the band-aid
that I gave someone else?

485
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,333
You're Thief Kid, aren't you!!

486
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,542
Ugh, she saw through me...

487
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,167
-Ow, ow, ow...
-Spit it out!!

488
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh boy...

489
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,417
It'd be kind of hard to keep on insisting
that I'm the waiter too...

490
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,292
But, I don't think forcing my way away
from her will either...

491
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,167
What's so funny?

492
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,542
Hurry up and confess.

493
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,583
So, what do you intend to do if I confess?

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,458
Will you take me to Inspector Nakamori?

495
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,833
Phooey, that's not a bad idea...

496
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,875
But, you're the one
who's going to get yourself in trouble

497
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,042
if you do that...

498
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,875
Huh... You still can figure out

499
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,542
Who I am...?

500
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,750
Right...

501
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,667
the true identity of Thief Kid

502
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,833
was... me!

503
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,042
Sorry, sorry.

504
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,917
Are you all right, Conan...

505
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:22,917
Did you catch a cold again?

506
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:23,917
It's not a cold.

507
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,667
What's the matter?

508
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,833
Did you forget my face
because we've been apart too long?

509
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:33,167
Thief Kid's identity is Shinichi you say?

510
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,625
Come off it!

511
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,500
It's probably just one of your disguises
that you pride yourself in...

512
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,708
Ow, ow, ow...

513
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,667
It's not a disguise?!

514
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,875
Course!

515
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,417
I've got nothing on.

516
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,208
No...

517
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,375
Back when I crash landed a plane,

518
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,708
and the Inspector pulled at his face,

519
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,667
the disguise didn't come off...

520
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,750
Maybe you both just look alike to begin with?

521
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,958
Damn, how careless of me.

522
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,667
That guy always comes to check out the place
before committing a crime...

523
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,250
- If we leave the diamond...
- Oh! Inspector Nakamori!

524
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,042
You've run out of luck now
that you've boarded this blimp

525
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,708
where there's no escape route...

526
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,042
Give yourself in!!

527
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,375
Not a blimp...

528
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,625
But a UFO... right?

529
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,875
If I remember correctly,

530
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,667
that what you said
when we were kids, right...

531
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,000
I must look like an unidentified alien

532
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,083
who suddenly appeared in a UFO to you,

533
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,292
but I'm playing the role of Thief Kid

534
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,208
because I have no other choice than to do so
in order to solve a certain case...

535
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,333
As proof of that

536
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:51,083
I return the things a steal
to the owners later, don't I?

537
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,917
B, But... but... What?!

538
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,708
Well... there's no way
that the renown detective Shinichi Kudo

539
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:01,292
would overlook a flashy thief like this,

540
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:04,417
so I thought
that you would figure it out, Ran...

541
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:07,000
If you want to catch me go ahead,

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'll give myself up...

543
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,083
Shin... ichi?

544
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,625
What's up?

545
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,875
Is something wrong?

546
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,292
Oh, no...

547
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,958
If you notice anything...

548
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,708
It's nothing...

549
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,583
I seem to have made a mistake. I'm sorry.

550
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,792
See you...

551
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,750
What's going on...

552
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,125
Shinichi is Thief Kid...

553
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:39,083
Which means that he was saying he was busy
because of cases he had to solve,

554
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,917
but was stealing all the while...

555
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,292
Hey, can you give me
the glass cup over there?

556
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,958
Huh? What's wrong with your arm?

557
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,333
Yep... it seems that
I've been bitten by a mosquito or something

558
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,667
and it's so itchy...

559
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,417
To think that there're mosquitoes
in a place like this too...

560
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,500
- Here.
-Thank you!

561
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,333
See you.

562
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,292
Hey.

563
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,333
I... don't believe you...

564
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,333
If you will excuse me, then.

565
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,375
Time, time!

566
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,292
Mr. Fujioka...

567
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,375
Well, excuse me, really.

568
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,583
Just as would be expected of the champion
of the Kanto Karate Tournament...

569
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,333
You've got great muscles.

570
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,500
Look! A blimp!!

571
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,292
Wow!

572
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,750
It looks like a whale!

573
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,792
It's a whale flying through the sky!

574
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,750
Thank you for waiting

575
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,458
Just great!!

576
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,625
Lady, another serving please!!

577
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,083
Hey

578
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,125
You've completely come back to life...

579
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,833
Moreover, lady, he says...

580
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,958
Thank you for waiting,

581
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,125
here's your cake dessert.

582
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,167
T, Thank you...

583
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,792
Wow! It was worth waiting for.

584
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,083
It looks delicious

585
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,042
Hmm?

586
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,833
What is added in this cream?

587
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,917
Isn't this blackberry?

588
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,958
Hey, Ran...

589
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Ran, I said!

590
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,542
I didn't know you liked
that type of person, Ran?

591
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,833
What are you staring at so seriously for?

592
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,292
It, It's nothing like that...

593
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,458
Maybe I should tell your hubby about it...

594
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,500
I told you it's nothing like that!

595
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,750
Like I'm saying, if you open this door

596
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,167
you can go out to the corridor in the middle.

597
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,292
And if we go out from the door in front...

598
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,833
We can go there, right?!

599
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,917
Right!

600
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,167
Are you children...

601
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,542
going somewhere?

602
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,625
Oh, no... well...

603
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:56,542
We were talking over whether
we should play cards in our room from now...

604
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:01,542
They're up to something again...

605
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,750
I can't wait

606
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,792
I want to get to Osaka as soon as possible

607
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,750
and meet Thief Kid

608
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,458
And if all possible...

609
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,000
If I can I'd like to place my lips

610
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,458
on his dauntless lips...

611
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,083
No, no, no darn way!!

612
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,125
T, Thief Kid is a criminal,

613
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,167
you know! It's just not right.

614
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,542
What are you getting all worked up for...

615
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:29,458
I, I'm not!

616
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,583
What...?

617
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,708
Nothing...

618
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,792
You guys, hurry up and eat!

619
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:37,625
Yes, sir!

620
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,083
Inspector Nakamori,

621
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,375
why don't you take your time and eat,

622
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,375
since my men
are keeping watch over the jewel...

623
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,583
But, Thief Kid is probably on the move
as we're eating too.

624
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,542
We're finished eating!

625
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:52,917
We're going back to our room
to play cards, then.

626
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,458
See you later

627
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,333
What's with them, hurrying on like that.

628
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,375
Thank you...

629
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,208
Oh, sorry.

630
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,708
Boy, be careful, will you...

631
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:07,250
Didn't your mother teach you
to cover your mouth

632
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,583
like this when you sneeze?

633
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,667
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

634
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,458
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay!

635
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,583
(Anonymous caller)
Who on earth is it?

636
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,875
Hello...

637
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,708
I scattered the killer bacteria

638
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,958
in the smoking room of the blimp.

639
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,125
What?!

640
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,542
Just what do you think you're talking about?!

641
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:32,292
Try looking under the sofa to the left.

642
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:33,542
Hey, wait!...

643
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,208
Is something wrong, Uncle?

644
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:42,125
No, it's nothing. It's a crank call.

645
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,833
Inspector...

646
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:08,750
What's this...?!

647
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,292
No doubt about it...

648
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,583
It's the same ampule as the one the guys

649
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,167
who attacked the research center dropped...

650
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,083
We haven't publicized this ampule.

651
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,833
Which means...

652
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,667
What the man said on the phone
is probably true.

653
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,500
The ampule that was found in the parking lot

654
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,833
was something that
the guys probably deliberately dropped there,

655
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,333
so that we could verify
whether the ampule in the smoking room

656
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,000
-is authentic or not...
-Darn!

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,333
At any rate, I'll inform the higher ups.

658
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,208
Thanks.

659
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,708
It seems that what the man said is true.

660
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,500
MY God.

661
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,750
I guess arresting Thief Kid
is not the problem right now.

662
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,208
Close off the smoking room right away!

663
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,375
Just to be safe,

664
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,458
we should close off this bar too.

665
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,417
Yes, sir!

666
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,375
What?! O, Oh no...

667
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,875
Are you sure?

668
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,625
Maybe it's just a prank or something...

669
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,708
No, unfortunately, not...

670
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,667
I just confirmed it with headquarters...

671
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,375
At any rate, just like I said before,

672
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,875
we're closing off
the smoking room on B-deck...

673
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,500
He... Help me...

674
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,917
R, Rash?!

675
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,542
Don't tell me he caught the germs?

676
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,667
Come to think of it,

677
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,292
he went to the smoking room a while ago...

678
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,500
Help me, please...

679
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,167
I sort of feel bad.

680
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,417
Cool it... calm down.

681
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,458
I don't want to die.

682
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,458
I, I'm sorry...

683
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,292
Don't be...

684
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,583
Ran, you should sterilize your hands
right away.

685
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,542
This way!

686
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:08,458
We've got sterilizing alcohol
in the service room!

687
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,417
Okay.

688
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,917
To think that we got people
who caught the germs in this blimp...

689
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,292
Is there anyone else who
went into the smoking room?

690
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:21,417
Hey! Are you all right?

691
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,875
R, Rash

692
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,000
on her right hand and left arm...

693
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,458
Darn, her too...

694
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,125
Where can we isolate them?

695
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:35,125
There's a hospital room
beyond the examination room.

696
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,042
There aren't any doctors on board today,

697
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:39,750
but we can lock the door from the outside.

698
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,583
Okay, let's move them over there.

699
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,125
I'll take them there...

700
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,917
Hey.

701
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:45,750
Okay!

702
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,417
Just to be safe,

703
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:53,167
we should close off this dining room too.

704
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,250
Then, all of you move over to the lounge.

705
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,958
Dad, get up!

706
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,750
I'm sure glad

707
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,500
that the children weren't here, though.

708
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,375
Yeah...

709
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:11,042
Yeah, we've better inform them
about this too...

710
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,125
True...

711
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,167
Oh, I'm sorry.

712
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,667
Oh no!!

713
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:22,792
It sure was fun, wasn't it!

714
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,958
Let's go to the tail of the whale next then!

715
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,375
Genta...

716
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:30,542
Whales have no tail...
they have rear fins...

717
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:31,958
-Is that so...
-Genta!!

718
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,375
Conan!

719
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,708
Oh, uh, we didn't know
that this place was off limits...

720
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,208
Genta,

721
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,333
do you feel all right?

722
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,833
He's got no rash...

723
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,333
Maybe he didn't catch it,

724
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,542
or is it still incubation period...

725
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,625
Hey, Conan?

726
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,875
What's the matter?

727
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:52,875
Yeah,

728
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,667
let's go explore the blimp together.

729
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,083
This is no time for that.

730
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,042
There's something really bad going on now.

731
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,000
What bad thing?

732
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,958
At any rate, let's go back to the cabin.

733
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:10,917
Pull away!

734
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,625
Stay still over here!

735
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,875
Who's that...

736
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,625
and what's that person in a place

737
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,667
like this anyway...

738
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,417
He removed the lock right now...?

739
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,583
Don't tell me that
he's the one scattering the germs...

740
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,583
Who is he?

741
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,167
Is he Thief Kid's accomplice?

742
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,583
Oh boy...

743
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,583
No...

744
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,917
I don't think he's with Thief Kid...

745
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:54,292
I'm sure he's with the Red Saimese Cat...

746
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:57,708
No good...

747
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,833
This is really bad...

748
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,583
Shoots!!

749
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,542
That's? Is that a bomb?

750
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,333
Go on beyond!

751
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,125
Climb the ladder by the gas shaft pole!

752
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,250
Hurry, quick.

753
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,833
Freeze!!

754
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:26,500
Who're you?

755
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,583
Did you find the ampule?

756
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,125
Red Siamese Cat...

757
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:36,833
We set a bomb up in the blimp...

758
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,042
If you do exactly as I say

759
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,083
we won't explode the bomb...

760
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,125
Lupin! Quiet!

761
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,417
I'm telling you be quiet...

762
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,708
How about the front and back?

763
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,125
Cat F... we seized the cockpit...

764
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,458
Cat D... we seized the kitchen...

765
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,792
Cat C... we seized the sky deck.

766
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,250
There's nobody in the passengers' cabine.

767
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,250
Okay...

768
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,750
Use the on board announcement device
and gather

769
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,375
the entire crew in the dining room!

770
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:18,042
Conan... what shall we do...?

771
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:23,125
To the entire crew on board!

772
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,208
Gather in the dining room

773
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:28,750
on the double.

774
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,792
We the Red Siamese Cats

775
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,708
have hijacked this blimp...

776
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,667
All of you, take out your cell phones.

777
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,542
Dad, wake up!

778
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,792
I don't have one.

779
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,167
It's me.

780
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,125
The blimp's been hijacked.

781
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,250
Just as I thought.

782
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,708
And what're they demanding?

783
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,167
What do you want?

784
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,000
Is it money?

785
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or do you want the members of your team
who are locked up released?

786
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:31,292
We have a grudge
against the Suzuki Financial Group.

787
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,792
And, especially against this old man here!

788
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:39,250
It's true that 10 years ago,

789
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,250
I helped the police crush their organization!

790
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,750
So, I'll be your hostage,

791
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,708
let the others go.

792
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,708
No darn way.

793
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:49,875
Why not!

794
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,583
This blimp is going to head for Osaka as is.

795
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:55,500
Contact the police.

796
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,417
Only,

797
00:42:56,417 --> 00:43:00,917
"if you make any funny moves,
we're going to bomb the blimp!"

798
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,042
Tell them that!

799
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,042
And...

800
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,833
This is the much rumored
about killer bacteria!

801
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,500
Don't you even think of arresting us...

802
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,292
Because if you do,
not only the smoking room,

803
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:18,583
but these killer bacteria will be scattered
throughout the entire cabin...

804
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,292
What shall we do, Conan?

805
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,375
We've got to go save Ai and the others!

806
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:27,250
Before that I've got to take the bomb apart.

807
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,250
Ai,

808
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,958
the accomplices of the culprits
maybe among the hostages

809
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,458
-so be careful.
-Roger...

810
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,708
I hope you guys didn't go
inside the smoking room.

811
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,417
You went in?!

812
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:45,125
Yeah... but all I did was look inside
just a little...

813
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,833
But it smelled so much of smoke,
that I closed the door right away.

814
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:50,958
Brother...!

815
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,417
Not only was he sneezed on,

816
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,833
he went to the smoking room too!

817
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,250
Don't worry,

818
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,500
because we didn't go inside.

819
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,750
We've got no rash either!

820
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:05,000
More than that, what about the bomb!

821
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,917
Y, Yeah... There are a total of 4 bombs.

822
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:12,583
Out of the four,
two are in the rear of the corridor below.

823
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,292
Near the fuel tank
is most probably the place.

824
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,125
You guys

825
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
do you think you can find the bombs?

826
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,958
Of course!

827
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:25,125
Only, don't dare touch it
even if you find it.

828
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,167
Let me know right away.

829
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:27,917
Yep, okay!

830
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:28,875
And,

831
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,667
if you start feeling even a little sick,

832
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,875
let me know too.

833
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:32,458
Understand!

834
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:33,292
Aye!

835
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,375
I'm sure that Ayumi and Mitsuhiko are okay.

836
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,125
But, Genta...

837
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,417
Darn!

838
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,583
I guess I've got no choice but to pray that
he hasn't caught the germs

839
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,833
Uh, where are the children...?

840
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,333
No need to worry, Conan is with them.

841
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,250
Just as I thought,

842
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,750
one of them is in back of the smoking room...

843
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,708
If they explode the bomb hidden there,

844
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:25,542
the bacteria scattered here
will spread through the entire blimp...

845
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:31,667
Moreover, if they open a hole in the blimp

846
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,375
the bacteria spread outside...

847
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,250
But, why are the culprits

848
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,667
using both the bomb and bacteria?

849
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:44,375
Because it's true that they can hijack
the blimp using just one of them...

850
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,750
Why?

851
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,542
Why are the culprits

852
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:54,125
using both the bacteria and the bomb...?

853
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,292
Maybe they just want to be extra sure?

854
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,375
Either way,

855
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,250
so long as they haven't made any demands yet,

856
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,458
we've got no choice
but to watch how things go for now...

857
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,625
Go after the blimp making sure

858
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,708
that they don't realize
you're following them.

859
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,292
I'll contact all the police departments

860
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,583
where the blimp will be passing through

861
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,625
as well as the Osaka Prefectural Police.

862
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,667
Yes, sir!

863
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,750
Conan, I found the bomb!

864
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,375
I've found one here too!

865
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,125
Okay,

866
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,250
we've only got one more left to go!

867
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,792
Get down!

868
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,125
I'll go look for the remaining one,

869
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,583
so you guys stay here and wait!

870
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,000
Open it.

871
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,750
Don't do anything funny

872
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,417
if you don't want any of the hostages
to be killed.

873
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:24,167
Just what are you doing Mr. Mizukawa?

874
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,542
Mr. Mizukawa, don't tell me that...!

875
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:27,708
It, It's nothing.

876
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,000
Mr. Mizuakwa...

877
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,500
It's nothing...

878
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:36,625
Rash?!

879
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,625
No!!

880
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:40,042
T, This is just rash from allergy!

881
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:42,833
Come to think of it,
he smelled of cigarettes just a while ago!

882
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,542
He went to the smoking
and caught the germs there...

883
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,417
No!!

884
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:49,500
I did go, but I didn't catch it!

885
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,792
As you know, the other places aren't...

886
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,458
If now, I can take on these two...

887
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,750
I can pin them now...

888
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,750
Go shove them in the smoking room!

889
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,375
Don't tell me that I caught it too...

890
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:49,250
Here it is...

891
00:48:56,792 --> 00:49:00,125
Uh, come to think of it the children
are nowhere in sight.

892
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,167
Children?

893
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:02,708
Oh, yes...

894
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:06,333
I'm sure that they were about
the same age as the three.

895
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,583
I'm sure there was one girl among them too...

896
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,292
Look for them.

897
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:12,917
She should mind her own business...

898
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,208
Conan,

899
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,583
they've noticed that all of you aren't here.

900
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,917
Conan, Conan...

901
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:25,917
Two men went off to look for you guys...

902
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,583
You're pretty cool, aren't you?

903
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,500
You?!

904
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,458
Just what do you think you're doing?!

905
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,333
Are you all right, Ai?

906
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:40,167
You're the pits, hitting a child!

907
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,333
Next time you do something funny,

908
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,375
I'm going to kill you.

909
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,167
Okay, that's it.

910
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,000
Did you guys do this?

911
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,958
I'm the one who did it.

912
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,667
They have nothing to do with this.

913
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,375
Phooey... you've got guts.

914
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,125
-Conan!!
-Don't move!

915
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,208
Shinichi.

916
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,042
Damn it!

917
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:00,375
All right!

918
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,125
Thief Kid?!

919
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,667
Nice catch!

920
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:04,458
Just as would be expected of Thief Kid!

921
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,250
Although he's an enemy, good for him!

922
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,417
Shinichi...!

923
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:13,625
So, Thief Kid's appeared after all.

924
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:16,417
Now, we can get rid of all the nuisance.

925
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,667
Go and set up two bombs!

926
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,250
I didn't think
he would throw you out the window.

927
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,042
What now, famed detective?

928
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,458
Do you want to give up?

929
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:29,750
Course not.

930
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,542
Go back to the blimp right this minute!

931
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,000
Don't be ridiculous.

932
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,375
My hand glider's not equipped
with an engine you know.

933
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:38,750
You're lucky we're even alive!

934
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:44,542
(Aichi city, Sakushima island)

935
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:58,417
They're headed straight west.

936
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:01,417
I guess they're headed for Osaka,
after all...

937
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,917
(Osaka police headquarters)
The blimp if flying over Tsuu city

938
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,583
of the Mie prefecture at present...

939
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,167
If they go on as is,

940
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,875
they'll probably reach Osaka
in about an hour from now...

941
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,708
At Nanko (harbor) the symbol
of the Suzuki Financial Group,

942
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:16,125
the Bell Tree Tower is there...

943
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:19,167
That's the destination of
the test flight of the blimp,,,

944
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,042
Are they planning to crash right
into that tower

945
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:24,458
and blow themselves up blimp and all...?

946
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,458
Is that the scenario that
the culprits who have a grudge

947
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:29,375
against the Suzuki Financial Group have
in store for them?

948
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,458
We can tell for sure
whether it is nor not...

949
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,333
But, if that's it,

950
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:36,500
the bacteria will spread all over Osaka.

951
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,500
The lives of over 700 million
will be endangered...

952
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,333
We've got to keep that from happening
at all costs...

953
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,958
But, what can we do...

954
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,083
Heiji!

955
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,958
Hey, what took you so long?

956
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:06,292
Sorry, sorry.

957
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,875
Who's this boy?

958
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:09,708
Hello.

959
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:14,250
Oh, he's Satoshi Kawaguchi...
He's relative of mine and

960
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,708
he moved to Nara from Yokohama in spring.

961
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:20,250
He was over at my house and playing,
so I brought him along.

962
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,083
Satoshi said he wanted to see you too, Heiji.

963
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,083
And, since you stick around with Conan a lot,

964
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,667
you like children, don't you Heiji?

965
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,833
Y, Yeah... sort of...

966
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,667
How do you do, nice to see you.

967
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,458
Yeah, nice meeting you too.

968
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,333
I hate to be intrusive,

969
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,667
but are you going with each other?

970
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,500
I, Idiot!

971
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,580
Why do I have to go
with somebody like her.

972
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:43,000
Heiji's just a childhood friend
and like a kid brother to me.

973
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,583
-She no darn way at all my type!
-We're not on a date today, either!

974
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:45,958
What a thing to say.

975
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:50,500
Which means that you don't mind me
taking Kazuha for my wife?

976
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,042
I don't mind, I don't mind at all.

977
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:55,167
If you don't mind wedding somebody like her

978
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:56,750
I'll wrap a ribbon around her
and give her to you.

979
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,292
Thank you, uncle Heiji!

980
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:00,708
Just who do you think you're calling uncle!

981
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,250
Oh come on, he's just a kid...

982
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:06,875
Satoshi,
I'm happy of how you feel about me,

983
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:10,167
but that's something
you have to give great thought to...

984
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,958
Besides, you're still too young
to get married anyway...

985
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,042
I know.

986
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:16,708
Boys can't get married
until they turn 18 right?

987
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,583
Okay, so if your feelings for me don't change

988
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,250
when you turn 18,

989
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,667
let's think about it then.

990
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:28,625
Okay, so much for this subject!

991
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,333
Oh, I hope the blimp would hurry up
and get here...

992
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:34,208
I've got to confront Thief Kid before that!

993
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,583
The stage will be over the skies
of Osaka City.

994
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:39,083
I'm sure
that we'll be able to see it from here...

995
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,542
If it's the ring side,
we've got super special seats!

996
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:43,750
I love Thief Kid so much.

997
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,167
I'll get a picture of him for sure!

998
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,958
Really, I can't wait!

999
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:53,625
Kudo...

1000
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,375
Yeah, where are you now?

1001
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,750
Sakushima in Mikawa Bay.

1002
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,167
What, you'll still in some place like that?

1003
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,917
I mean, not really,
I was thrown off, you see.

1004
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,500
Thrown off?

1005
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,917
The fact is, Hattori...

1006
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:09,500
What the...?!

1007
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,250
Are you serious?!

1008
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,333
Yeah,

1009
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:16,250
a blimp carrying bombs, the killer bacteria

1010
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,792
and hijackers are headed that way!

1011
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:22,167
W, What a gorgeous menu

1012
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:26,250
Pork, squid, octopus,
with fried noodles mix patty...

1013
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,208
Two people have already been infected...

1014
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,833
Make that three.

1015
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,375
The director called Mizukawa
came down with rash

1016
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,917
on the palm of his right hand.

1017
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:36,667
You heard him...

1018
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,792
I just thought I'd let you know about this.

1019
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,583
Are you all right?

1020
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,042
Yeah, at least for now...

1021
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:51,375
Oh, it's the police chopper...

1022
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,000
I wonder if they're going after the blimp...

1023
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,208
Police department...

1024
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,958
Sorry, I'll call you back again!

1025
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,417
Hey, hold it, you!

1026
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,542
Darn! going off on his own again...

1027
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:04,708
It can't be helped.

1028
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:06,708
I want to go to the place
that sells good food

1029
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,625
and eat right away...

1030
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:12,458
Weren't you talking with somebody
about a good Okonomiyaki shop?

1031
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,167
Well,

1032
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,000
did you find anything on their identity?

1033
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,375
Well, we tried investigating all the way
to an acquaintance

1034
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,542
who was close to the former executive but...

1035
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:25,083
No likely person emerged.

1036
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:27,000
No good after, eh...

1037
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:29,833
Yes, Megure here...

1038
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,458
Inspector Megure, this is Kudo.

1039
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,042
Oh, Mr. Kudo!

1040
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:36,083
I'm in Sakushima of Aichi Prefecture
right now but,

1041
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:38,500
a police chopper is going after the blimp...

1042
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,125
Yeah, Officer Sato and Takagi are on board.

1043
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,542
The thing is Kudo...

1044
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,417
I already know about the hijacking.

1045
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,875
I have a favor to ask of you, inspector...

1046
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,750
Huh, what could it be?

1047
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,875
I want to get on board that chopper too...

1048
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,833
I, Shinichi Kudo...

1049
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,583
Hey, where is Shinichi Kudo?

1050
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,417
You're him, aren't you?

1051
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,750
So, I'm telling you
to disguise yourself as me.

1052
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,083
Oh, boy...

1053
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,167
So, I'm going to disguise myself
as you again.

1054
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,458
Oh, well...

1055
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:15,750
I don't mind helping you,

1056
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,875
but, don't you get in the way of my job.

1057
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,292
I can't give you my word, though

1058
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,125
I'll try to cooperate with you
as much as possible...

1059
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:30,875
Alright.

1060
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,208
Cat E, start preparing.

1061
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,083
Roger!

1062
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,833
What is it?

1063
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,875
What're they planning to do?

1064
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,708
It's been a long time, Mr. Kudo!

1065
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,833
Hi...

1066
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,250
But, what a surprise

1067
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,458
that Conan is also with you.

1068
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,667
Did you have something to do in Sakushima?

1069
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,542
We'll talk about that later.

1070
00:57:56,542 --> 00:57:58,375
Please continue following the airship.

1071
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,292
Please follow the airship.

1072
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,417
There it is! The blimp.

1073
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,833
Please go up close

1074
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,625
and stay at a high enough altitude

1075
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:17,958
so the hijackers don't notice you.

1076
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:18,625
Roger.

1077
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,000
What is the direction of the wind
and speed of the chopper right now?

1078
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,500
East southeast,
going at a velocity of 200 kilos!

1079
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,250
Please keep going as is,
and after you overtake the blimp,

1080
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,875
match the speed to the blimp.

1081
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:34,958
Mr. Kudo?

1082
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,167
Mr. Kudo, just what do you intend to do...

1083
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:53,167
See you, we'll be leaving you now.

1084
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,958
Thief Kid?!

1085
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,417
W, Wings! Wings!

1086
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,375
Put your wings away!!

1087
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,083
Hurry up and put away your wings!!

1088
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,708
I can't push the switch
because you're in the way!!

1089
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:22,833
Darn!

1090
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,958
Oh, hey,
just where do you think you're touching.

1091
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,125
S, Stop it.

1092
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:29,458
Stay still, I'll push the switch right now.

1093
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,083
Boy, but it's ticklish...

1094
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:31,875
Endure!

1095
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,125
Hey, that's...

1096
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,583
Look out!

1097
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:50,958
L, Let's get out of here!

1098
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,625
By the way, Mr. Kudo is...

1099
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:00,792
Was he Thief Kid?

1100
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:15,542
Oh, well, good luck then...

1101
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:17,292
Aren't you going?

1102
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,417
I'm staying here
and checking things out for a while.

1103
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,917
The diamond has fallen into those
robbers' hands anyways.

1104
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:25,792
That's right...

1105
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:27,792
Here

1106
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:30,833
H, Hey. What's this?

1107
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,958
It's Jirokichi's fingerprint seal.

1108
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,875
Thank you!

1109
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:44,250
My deduction that he'd be using

1110
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,500
a fingerprint recognition glass case
this time hit the bull's eye but...

1111
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:51,333
I won't use it anymore, so you can have it.

1112
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,333
More than that,

1113
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,375
you'd better take care of
your precious girlfriend...

1114
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:01,583
That guy called Fujioka
grabbed both her arms.

1115
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,875
She jumped away right away, though.

1116
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,875
He didn't sneeze or cough so

1117
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,375
I don't think she was infected
or anything but...

1118
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,625
I thought... I'd let you know.

1119
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:30,500
Not here...

1120
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,542
I was sure that they rigged it here but...

1121
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,000
Not here either...

1122
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:43,667
Maybe they rigged it in a different place
than they did before...

1123
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,625
I only found two, after all...

1124
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,417
Moreover, the bombs that were found were

1125
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:59,958
where Genta and Mitsuhiko were...

1126
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,750
Why...

1127
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,250
why didn't they reset the bomb

1128
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,917
in the most important place,
where the bacteria is...

1129
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,375
I guess, I'd better start
by taking this apart...

1130
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,083
Hey, Kudo!
You said you were going to call me back,

1131
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,208
but you never did!

1132
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,333
Kudo?

1133
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:21,708
Oh... I mean... C, Conan

1134
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,292
Sorry, sorry, I completely forgot.

1135
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,417
Oh boy...

1136
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:26,833
where are you now?

1137
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,750
Inside the blimp.

1138
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,542
You went back there already?

1139
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,542
You're really fast, aren't you?

1140
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,125
By the way, what do you want?

1141
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm busy right now, you see.

1142
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:39,583
The hijackers publicized the thing
about the blimp on the internet,

1143
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:42,208
so Osaka is entirely panicked out.

1144
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,083
What?!

1145
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:47,625
The trains are jam packed with people
traveling from Osaka to the west.

1146
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,333
Like I said, there are no more seats.

1147
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,333
If in the direction of Tokyo...

1148
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,167
Idiot!!
Why should I go where the bacteria is!!

1149
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,583
Trains are coming in succession

1150
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,708
Don't push!

1151
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,125
Come on,
there's still space for people to get it!

1152
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,917
Please board the next train.

1153
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,375
(OSAKA STATION)

1154
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,667
The expressways and regular streets heading
from Osaka to the west are filled with cars.

1155
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,917
And there is a terrible traffic jam.

1156
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,792
It seems that the tellers of the bank
as well as the security guards

1157
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:20,375
are all being told to evacuate,

1158
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,292
so the best time to steal is now.

1159
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:25,250
I don't think that's a good idea,

1160
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,083
because security is tight everywhere now.

1161
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,792
I'm only joking. Only joke.

1162
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:32,125
Keep out of the conversation of the adults!

1163
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,750
Security...

1164
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:38,417
What it is... Don't scare me!

1165
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,917
You can see something interesting.

1166
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,292
Sorry, I'll call you back.

1167
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,042
H, hey?!...

1168
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,458
Darn, he hung up again...

1169
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,083
What's going on, what's going on?...

1170
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:51,792
Uh, Kazuha?

1171
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:52,750
What?

1172
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,750
Who was Uncle Heiji talking to just now?

1173
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,583
Oh... to Conan.

1174
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,167
Conan?

1175
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,792
He's about the same age as you Satoshi,

1176
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:04,292
and a super smart elementary school boy.

1177
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:07,000
It seems
he gets along really well with Heiji.

1178
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,542
Then it's not a conversation
between adults, is it...?

1179
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:09,458
Hey!!

1180
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:12,250
Stop talking about things
you don't need to talk about!!

1181
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,083
Yes, yes, I'm so sorry,

1182
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,542
Uncle Heiji

1183
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:25,167
What's the interesting thing?!

1184
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:39,375
A flare?

1185
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:40,833
What do you mean...

1186
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,958
If we go over these mountains, it's Nara.

1187
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,125
The people of Nara are sure
going to be surprised

1188
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,667
seeing a blimp smoking
while flying over their city.

1189
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,667
They're not only going to be surprised,

1190
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,208
they're going to panic.

1191
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,292
Panic?

1192
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,833
They made public on the internet

1193
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:06,583
about the bacteria and bomb.

1194
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,167
I'm sure that the people
are being evacuated just about now...

1195
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,333
Well, if that's what's happening in Nara,

1196
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:14,708
it's super for a thief.

1197
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:15,917
Idiot,

1198
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:17,333
even if people are gone,

1199
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,625
in modern days
they have security... you know...

1200
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,458
Security?

1201
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,250
Don't tell me...

1202
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,375
That's why they're headed for Nara!

1203
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,708
It could be...

1204
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,708
But... if so,

1205
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:31,958
why did those guys...

1206
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,583
use the bacteria for something like this...

1207
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,583
I see... I got it.

1208
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,250
Leave it to me!

1209
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,333
Where are you going, Heiji?

1210
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,458
Nara! To Nara!

1211
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:46,583
Nara?!

1212
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:47,667
Nara,

1213
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,583
you mean it has to do with that blimp?

1214
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,500
Yeah,

1215
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,417
it's dangerous so don't come with me!

1216
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:54,958
Please take me there too!

1217
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:55,625
Idiot!

1218
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,833
I just told you not to come with me!

1219
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,333
I know the streets of Nara,

1220
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,917
so I'm sure that I can be of use to you!

1221
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:01,958
I'm going too!

1222
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,292
You too?

1223
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:06,875
Besides, three people riding one motorbike
is against the law...

1224
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,458
No problem, no problem...

1225
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,417
I came upon a good idea!

1226
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,958
Hang on tight!

1227
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,458
I know!

1228
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,625
Satoshi, are you all right?

1229
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,458
Y, Yep... I'm fine.

1230
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,958
We'll be there soon, so hold on for a while.

1231
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,083
I wonder if this is what I should be doing...

1232
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:37,583
Oh no... why?

1233
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,167
Ran?

1234
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:52,625
Ran!

1235
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,875
Ran! Ran!!

1236
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:01,958
Sit down!!

1237
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:09,333
Ran...?

1238
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:25,625
Rash...?

1239
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,417
Please help me Please!!

1240
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:38,417
Let go!!

1241
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,125
Come! You go inside and stay there too!!

1242
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,667
Don't touch me!!

1243
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,792
Darn!

1244
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,542
What's going on...

1245
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:06,875
Just as Thief Kid said,

1246
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,667
she couldn't have gotten infected
just because he grabbed her arm.

1247
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,542
Besides, Ran leaped away,

1248
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,875
and Mr. Fujioka had no rash
and didn't sneeze either...

1249
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,250
In comparison...

1250
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,167
Genta was not only sneezed on,

1251
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,167
he most likely inhaled
the air of the smoking room

1252
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:22,500
and yet wasn't infected...

1253
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:23,958
Why?

1254
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,458
That director called Mizukawa

1255
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:31,500
had rash here.

1256
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,792
Maybe...

1257
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,375
The blimp's going to come falling!

1258
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,625
M Bacteria!
Bacteria's going to come falling!!

1259
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,875
They're loaded with bombs!

1260
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,125
(Hofu Temple)
Everyone here?

1261
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:06,500
Hurry, hurry! Evacuate

1262
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,125
But, the Buddha.

1263
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:12,125
The Buddha
will not be infected by the bacteria!

1264
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,625
Please ride, quickly!

1265
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:14,708
I hope we don't get punished for this

1266
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:15,958
Think about it, if you're punished.

1267
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,333
Just get in, please...

1268
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,500
Ran...

1269
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,333
Ran...

1270
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:34,958
Go look.

1271
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:35,792
Yes, sir!

1272
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:55,792
Hey.

1273
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:58,750
You're?

1274
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,875
Cat A...

1275
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,083
Cat A, what's wrong? Answer me!

1276
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:10,625
Shoots! Go check things out!

1277
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:11,250
Yes, sir!

1278
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,125
Hey, what's the matter?

1279
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:28,667
Hey!!

1280
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,458
A, Are you... sleeping?!

1281
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:45,917
Cat B!!

1282
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,833
What's up?! What's wrong?

1283
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,042
Cat B!!

1284
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:52,167
Cat B is passed out on the roof.

1285
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,542
Strange...

1286
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,208
Cats usually don't fall on their backs.

1287
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,250
It's Conan!

1288
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,667
He's back!

1289
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,375
Thief Kid's with him too

1290
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,042
Thief Kid's not here.

1291
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,083
Darn!

1292
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,875
Cats C, D, E,

1293
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:06,875
catch that brat!!

1294
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,000
Rather...

1295
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,583
shoot him as soon as you find him!

1296
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,542
-Roger!
-Roger!

1297
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,833
You go and keep guard over the dining room

1298
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:16,625
Cat F!

1299
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,583
Roger!

1300
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:22,708
I'll switch over to automatic pilot
and head over that side!

1301
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,083
Darn!

1302
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,458
Darn!

1303
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:56,833
The brat's in the sky deck!

1304
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,292
1...

1305
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:24,833
7

1306
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:33,750
The thing rigged
for Thief Kid came in handy...

1307
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,417
And, this too...

1308
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,583
Wait a sec...

1309
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,292
Maybe he gave this deliberately to me
so that I would use it.

1310
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,792
Freeze!!

1311
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,375
Throw that down!

1312
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:49,292
Raise your hands in the air.

1313
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,708
I saw you.

1314
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:54,333
You sure do a lot of stuff, don't you?

1315
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,583
Come on, get down on your hands over there!

1316
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,583
D, Do I have to?

1317
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,042
Listen to me...!

1318
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:01,042
Y, Yes, sir.

1319
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:03,542
I'm not like the others so far, you know

1320
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,458
Oh goodness! I told you so. Why you

1321
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:12,250
Darn!!

1322
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:27,958
Hey, hey, are you serious...

1323
01:14:30,917 --> 01:14:32,208
What's this?...

1324
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:36,625
The third trap
that Jirokichi got ready for you.

1325
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,958
I get it.

1326
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,083
If I try to escape from that window
after snatching the jewel

1327
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:43,333
and fire my wire gun...

1328
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,167
Close call close call!

1329
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,958
That old man is really something.

1330
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:52,917
You mean you were up there all this time?

1331
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:14,917
Take this!

1332
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:31,833
Amazing!

1333
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:39,875
Talk about an... award-winning warrior.

1334
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,167
The rest of you, are you listening?

1335
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,708
I beat your leader up.

1336
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,042
The same with the other three too.

1337
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:50,542
W, What?

1338
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,000
You gotta be joking.

1339
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,500
Go get him, Lupin!

1340
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:12,708
All right!!

1341
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:13,833
Come on

1342
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,792
Don't go swinging stuff like this around!

1343
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:19,042
Conan?

1344
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,042
The two over here are beat up too.

1345
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:22,042
Roger!

1346
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:34,792
Talk about a lot of call history... Moreover,

1347
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:37,792
all in the last 2 to 3 hours...

1348
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,125
Uh, who were you talking to
on the cell phone?

1349
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:42,417
I mean, this are so many calls here...

1350
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:46,083
If you don't want to talk about it...

1351
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,417
What're you going to do with it...

1352
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,917
If you don't tell me from your side

1353
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,208
I'll call all the people in here...

1354
01:16:56,958 --> 01:16:58,458
suit yourself...

1355
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:16,167
Okay... Put it down once...

1356
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:17,375
Slowly...

1357
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:21,833
I see...

1358
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:25,417
A really great idea...

1359
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:27,208
Bio terror strategy using the blimp...

1360
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:28,792
The real motive behind the crime

1361
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:31,292
was to steal all the national treasures
at one time

1362
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:34,417
after everyone evacuates from the temple

1363
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:37,458
and it is emptied out...

1364
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,792
They tried to take advantage of the fact

1365
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,750
that the security of the temple
is not too tight!

1366
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,583
Because people usually wouldn't think

1367
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,833
that statues would be stolen.

1368
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,458
Heaven'll punish them for sure!

1369
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,000
Just what're you talking about?

1370
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,333
We were trying to protect the statues...

1371
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,667
Then, I don't care who...
just give me one of the names

1372
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:56,500
of the officers that work
at the Nara Prefectural Police Station.

1373
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,125
W, Well...

1374
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:00,500
What, you don't even know one person?

1375
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,458
That's strange, and you're a police officer?!

1376
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,208
Come on, there's an Inspector

1377
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,083
with just the right name for Na

1378
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:09,250
All we have to take on is a brat.

1379
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,667
Get him!

1380
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:13,458
Hello? Did you just say something?

1381
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,750
He said that all he has to take on are brats.

1382
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,833
what?

1383
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:18,708
Maybe those guys are stupid?

1384
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:20,792
Really...

1385
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,958
What makes you think that we'd come here,

1386
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,500
just we three,
when we've come to nab thieves!

1387
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,208
What?!

1388
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:28,083
Darn!!

1389
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,042
Oh, I'm Inspector Tsuyoshi Shikantsuno
from the third inspection division

1390
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,375
of the Nara prefectural police.

1391
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:36,208
(Tsuyoshi Shinkantsuno, Nara city police)
Don't forget!

1392
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,708
Don't you ever make light of
the Nara Prefectural Police!!

1393
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:43,792
Hey, Kudo...

1394
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,708
The guys who were after the statue...

1395
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,500
have all been arrested.

1396
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,333
Of course, the monks and everybody else
are all safe!

1397
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,375
I got it!

1398
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,333
Thanks big brother, Heiji!

1399
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,583
What's this?

1400
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,417
So that Osaka detective boy

1401
01:18:56,417 --> 01:18:58,208
was pulling the strings after all, eh?

1402
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,833
...Pulling the strings...

1403
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:01,792
Right...

1404
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,458
Here, this.

1405
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,583
Oh, thanks little sonny.

1406
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:10,583
We've got to hurry
and take Ran to the hospital.

1407
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,500
Oh, right, and about that...

1408
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,167
I don't want to die...

1409
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:29,750
Ran...

1410
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,042
Conan?!

1411
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:35,625
No!!

1412
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,333
Don't come, Conan!!

1413
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,458
Don't worry, Ran,

1414
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,500
because no one is infected by bacteria.

1415
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,458
Huh?...

1416
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,125
But, I've got rash...

1417
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:48,500
That's just simple itchy rash.

1418
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,875
You must've touched lacquer or something.

1419
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,083
Lacquer?

1420
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,875
The person who brought you here, Ran,

1421
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,958
wasn't he the same man who
Mr. Mizukawa here too?

1422
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:58,958
Y, Yes...

1423
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,250
Just as I thought...

1424
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:04,500
I think he was the only one among them
was immune to lacquer...

1425
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,250
Because his nails were black.

1426
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:12,000
He was probably a lacquer craftsman
or something in the past.

1427
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,333
In other words,

1428
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:17,792
the hijackers never stole the bacteria
to begin with.

1429
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:20,708
All they did was bomb the research center

1430
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:24,167
and made it look like they were
really committing a bio terror attack.

1431
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:27,583
As proof of this is this ampule...

1432
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:32,292
...I tried to open the lid of this ampule
in front of the leader,

1433
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:35,708
but he seemed completely calm...

1434
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:37,917
If bacteria was inside,

1435
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,958
he would've desperately tried to stop me,
right?

1436
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,083
Like you shouted at me a while ago, Ran.

1437
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:44,583
Conan...

1438
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:46,833
That's right, isn't it, Pops?

1439
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:48,542
Huh? Yeah...

1440
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,417
Are you okay, Ran...?

1441
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:52,750
Beside, look...

1442
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,625
Aside from the rash you had at the start

1443
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,667
you have rash on the palm of your hands,
in the back of your arms...

1444
01:20:56,667 --> 01:21:00,917
and in the back of your thighs, right?

1445
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:02,292
Huh, no joke?

1446
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,000
I think that the hijackers

1447
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,792
sprayed lacquer
in every corner of this room...

1448
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:11,125
On the walls, sofa, and the door knob...

1449
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:13,792
That's why when Mr. Fujioka
who smoked in this room

1450
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:17,333
and came down with rash
from lacquer grabbed you on your arm,

1451
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:19,625
your arm broke out in rash.

1452
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,208
But, as to the other parts,

1453
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:23,625
rash broke out only in places
where you touched...

1454
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,792
something in this room...

1455
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,125
Wait a sec...

1456
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,667
then, why did that person...!!

1457
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,042
Don't tell me that!

1458
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,292
H, Hey,

1459
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:35,292
what's the matter?!

1460
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,417
Conan...

1461
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,458
Shoots...

1462
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,833
We got word from the Nara Prefectural Police

1463
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,875
that they found out
the identity of the hijack group.

1464
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:08,083
They're a group that
have experience being guards abroad.

1465
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,792
Guards, eh...

1466
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,583
Then, the name Red Siamese Cat was...

1467
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,583
They have nothing to do with that group.

1468
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:17,000
They disguised themselves
as a terrorist organization

1469
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,833
to camouflage their true intent
as Buddha statue thieves...

1470
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:24,583
And the one
who hired those guys with money was...

1471
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,625
Wait a sec...

1472
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:52,167
Don't you think it's much too cowardly

1473
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,125
to leave your men behind and flee alone?

1474
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:57,583
Boss of the hijack group,

1475
01:22:57,583 --> 01:22:59,750
Mr. Takamichi Fukioka?

1476
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,917
Brat, good work disclosing my identity...

1477
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:05,292
No...

1478
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:08,250
I was completely thrown off

1479
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,250
because you pretended to be the first one
who was infected...

1480
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:13,375
It's most likely that your woman accomplice
soon after takeoff,

1481
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:17,542
sprayed liquefied lacquer
in the smoking room,

1482
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,167
and placed the ampule there...

1483
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:23,292
Of course she did it
under your instructions...

1484
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,458
After that, you deliberately
went into the smoking room

1485
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,792
to come down with rash from lacquer...

1486
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:33,083
In order to make us believe
that you were infected by the bacteria...

1487
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:35,875
You invited Pops to come to the smoking room

1488
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,000
on the sky deck too, because...

1489
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:41,375
Mr. Mouri,
would you like to join me for a smoke?

1490
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,625
You grabbed Ran's arm because,

1491
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,917
you wanted to get people who
would get in your way

1492
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:50,333
to look like they got infected
to render them immobile...

1493
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:53,333
Since Pops didn't work out like you planned,

1494
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:56,292
you probably put a sleeping drug
in his beer or something.

1495
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,708
Thanks to you,
he was fast asleep until a while ago...

1496
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:02,292
Mr. Mizukawa and the waitress

1497
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,792
broke out in rash on the palm of their hands
and in back of their arms...

1498
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,667
They probably touched something
in the smoking room.

1499
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:11,708
Genta only looked inside the smoking room,

1500
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:15,042
but didn't touch anything,
so he didn't broke out in rash...

1501
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:18,042
In other words, you're the only one...

1502
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:19,292
who broke out in rash in places
that could not be touched easily,

1503
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:21,917
like your face and throat,
and even on your chest!

1504
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:25,958
Besides, the leader seemed to
have constantly been in touch with someone...

1505
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:29,667
That's how I figured it out...

1506
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:32,542
That fact that you,
covered your entire body with the lacquer

1507
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:35,083
that was sprayed all over the smoking room,

1508
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,542
to break out in rash in order to
breed terror of bacterial infection.

1509
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,375
You isolated yourself deliberately

1510
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,000
and gave orders out to the hijackers

1511
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,292
from a place where nobody would see you.

1512
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:45,875
You're the big boss
who was pulling the strings behind the scene!

1513
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:51,583
Pretty good deduction there, brat...

1514
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:54,458
But, you've overlooked an important point...

1515
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:55,333
What?

1516
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,083
First of all, I'm not planning to flee alone.

1517
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,583
I'm sorry to say that all your men are...

1518
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:04,583
Not them...

1519
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,167
Not the men I paid to hire...

1520
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:09,333
The men that worked under me from before.

1521
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,167
Don't tell me that there're more...

1522
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,667
Freeze!!

1523
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,292
Sonoko!!

1524
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:20,167
I told you don't move.

1525
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,583
Conan, there are still two more!

1526
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:26,542
The cameraman and reporter
are his accomplices too!

1527
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:27,542
Darn!

1528
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,292
Secondly,

1529
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:32,750
I didn't come here to flee.

1530
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,083
I came to lure you out.

1531
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,125
What?!

1532
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,500
Do you know why we planned the hijack

1533
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,458
to steal Buddha statues
instead of take money?

1534
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:45,375
In the IT world of today,

1535
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,500
the flow of money is sure
to be tracked down right away.

1536
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,583
Therefore,

1537
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:51,542
we figured that
stealing priceless Buddha statues

1538
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:53,917
were safer to deal with...

1539
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:57,500
Japanese Buddha statues
are popular abroad too,

1540
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,042
and we already had buyers waiting
for them too...

1541
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:04,333
I'll make you pay for
washing our profit down the drain.

1542
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:11,375
We still have a lot of time...

1543
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,167
Let's enjoy to the fullest...

1544
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:20,167
Mr. Hattori, you've done a great job!

1545
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:21,917
The one who did a great job
is that boy over there!

1546
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:24,583
By the way,
will you please go after that blimp?

1547
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,292
I can't get a hold of the boy
from a while ago.

1548
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:29,125
I have this bad feeling, you see...

1549
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:30,167
Okay!

1550
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,667
Listen Satoshi...

1551
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,083
you go on home from here.

1552
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:36,667
Huh?... But...

1553
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:38,250
I know...

1554
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,958
we were able to save the Buddha statues
thanks to you.

1555
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:43,375
Uh, Uncle Heiji.

1556
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:47,833
I think the thieves are after Gofuku Temple.

1557
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,292
They have a lot of national treasure there.

1558
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,708
Okay! I got it!

1559
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,750
Then, take me with you...

1560
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,042
No.

1561
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,375
It's too dangerous.

1562
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,833
Go home with Kazuha!

1563
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,625
Satoshi, let's do that, okay?

1564
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,875
I'm sure your mother's worried too

1565
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:09,792
Okay...

1566
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:11,667
but then,

1567
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:14,167
introduce me to the boy
called Conan next time!

1568
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:17,125
You're going to save him, aren't you,
Uncle Heiji?

1569
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,250
Okay, I promise!

1570
01:27:19,792 --> 01:27:21,917
Kazuha, take care of things from here, okay?

1571
01:27:21,917 --> 01:27:23,083
You can count on me.

1572
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:24,583
You be careful too, Heiji.

1573
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:25,292
I will.

1574
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:28,125
Okay! Here goes.

1575
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,875
Y, Yes...

1576
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:48,750
To think that
you were their accomplices too...

1577
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,417
The other side's okay.

1578
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:53,667
Hey!

1579
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:55,292
Hurry and let me go!

1580
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,625
Oh, sorry, sorry...

1581
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,708
I forgot to tell you guys but,

1582
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:02,583
we've had a slight change in plans...

1583
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:03,708
Change in plans?

1584
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:07,500
After all,
this is all the loot with ended up with...

1585
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,000
You're going to have to die

1586
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,542
along with them!!

1587
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:12,583
What?!

1588
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,083
Let me tell you something good
before your final moment.

1589
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,500
We'll be bidding you farewell

1590
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,625
by that bridge over there
where our cruiser is anchored...

1591
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:39,917
Soon after we leave,
the blimp will explode...

1592
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:43,125
along with the cabin
where the passengers are...

1593
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:45,208
I see... that's why.

1594
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:47,333
You may have removed the bomb

1595
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,333
that was placed near the fuel tank but,

1596
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:54,000
there were two others left in the cabin.

1597
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,125
Darn!!

1598
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,167
But, before that...

1599
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:07,292
As for you, I'll have you drown at sea here
and disappear.

1600
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:09,958
Darn, what now...

1601
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:11,167
What can I do...

1602
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:15,458
to turn things around at once
and get out of this situation?

1603
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,750
There it is! The blimp!!

1604
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,250
It's flying pretty low, isn't it...?

1605
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:30,083
Uh... if they go as is...

1606
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,833
they'll crash into Ohashi of Akashi Strait!!

1607
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:47,708
Port Tower is in view!

1608
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:49,542
The squid mark of Rokko too!!

1609
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:50,958
Wow!!

1610
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,708
You're trying to distract me

1611
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:56,750
so that I bump my head on the pillar
or the bridge or something, eh?

1612
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,417
I'm not falling for such a childish trick.

1613
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:18,583
W, What the?!

1614
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:19,583
What's the matter?!

1615
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:24,417
Damn!

1616
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:48,750
Wow...

1617
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:52,083
The whale took a leap...

1618
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,333
Hello.

1619
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:23,333
Hey, Kudo, are you okay?

1620
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,625
Oh, Hattori, great timing.

1621
01:31:25,625 --> 01:31:27,792
Contact the coastguard, will you?

1622
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:29,375
The coastguard?

1623
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:31,958
The head of the hijackers,
Fujioka fell into the sea.

1624
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:34,292
The hijacker fell into the sea?!

1625
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:35,625
Yeah...

1626
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,625
and near the bridge,
their cruiser is supposed

1627
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,458
to be anchored with other members on it.

1628
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,208
Nab those guys too, will you.

1629
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,667
Got you!

1630
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:44,125
See you later, then...

1631
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,083
We're having okonomiyaki tomorrow,

1632
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,833
so look forward to it.

1633
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,375
Hey, Hattori?

1634
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:53,500
Was that call from Shinichi?

1635
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,667
Huh? Uh...

1636
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,542
I'd like to ask you something...

1637
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:02,667
Is Shinichi... Thief Kid?

1638
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,750
What?

1639
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,542
Hey, everybody, are you all okay?

1640
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:11,083
Yes, somehow...

1641
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,250
We were just a little surprised.

1642
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,792
Where're those guys?!

1643
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:18,000
If you're talking about the two culprits,
they're passed out over there.

1644
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,208
They crashed into the wall

1645
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:22,000
when the blimp sharply ascended
a while ago...

1646
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,708
Serves them right...

1647
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,875
I guess we were saved because we were tied...

1648
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:31,167
Well, I was surprised.

1649
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,917
I went to the hall to check things out.

1650
01:32:32,917 --> 01:32:35,625
Then, suddenly the floor tilted...

1651
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,042
Why you, Thief Kid!!

1652
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:38,167
Dear Thief Kid.

1653
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,542
Where's Conan?

1654
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:41,667
That boy's fine.

1655
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:44,875
I'm sure he'll be here in a little while...

1656
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Please untie everyone's rope then.

1657
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh, dear Thief Kid, me too...

1658
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,708
Stop!
Thief Kid you prick!

1659
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:57,333
Oh, of course untie the inspector last,
please.

1660
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,417
Then, everyone,

1661
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:09,708
I shall take the jewel with me as I promised.

1662
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:12,375
Wait up!

1663
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:13,708
Hold it, Thief Kid!!

1664
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,583
How dare you petty thief!

1665
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:17,417
It's Thief Kid.

1666
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:31,000
Hmm... Oh...

1667
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:33,083
and the hijackers?

1668
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,333
I see, okay...

1669
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:36,167
Good work.

1670
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,417
All the hostages are safe.

1671
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:42,375
The group of criminals
have all been arrested.

1672
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:47,583
and... the case is closed... now...

1673
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:48,667
Yeah...

1674
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,083
Oh, I'm starved!

1675
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,875
It's finally the long awaited dinner time.

1676
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,875
I wonder if they have eels over rice.

1677
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,292
I can't help feeling we forgot something...

1678
01:34:07,292 --> 01:34:08,417
Now that you mentioned it...

1679
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:16,083
Okay, so it's quiz time
that you've all waited for!

1680
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:19,083
We haven't been waiting for it...

1681
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:23,708
Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko
are really good children but,

1682
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:28,125
who out of the three
have nothing to do with the flight?

1683
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,042
What? Is that... all?

1684
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:35,875
If you don't know the answer,
I'll give you a hint...

1685
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:38,833
All three have something to do with it,
right?

1686
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:41,833
If all three are good children,

1687
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:44,458
none of them will get into a fight, right?

1688
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:47,542
Flight... no fight...

1689
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:48,500
Oh, I see.

1690
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,000
I see.

1691
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,417
Oh,

1692
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:55,917
if only he was a simpleton like this riddle,

1693
01:34:55,917 --> 01:34:57,375
I could've nabbed him easily

1694
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,958
and made the front pages...

1695
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,167
Uh, Sonoko.

1696
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:05,958
Where's Ran?

1697
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,583
Come to think of it, they sure are late.

1698
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,583
She said to go on ahead

1699
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,500
So I thought she had to go
to the restroom or something...

1700
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,375
She went up the elevator...

1701
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,875
I wonder if she went to meet Thief Kid?

1702
01:35:18,875 --> 01:35:19,750
What?!

1703
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:26,417
It obviously isn't transparent...

1704
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:27,292
Shinichi...

1705
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:30,708
Uh, Shinichi...

1706
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:33,500
Oh no! Come to think of it,
she did say something to that effect...

1707
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,708
Hi there, Ran...

1708
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:38,833
Today was a pretty stimulating day,
wasn't it...

1709
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,583
Shinichi!!

1710
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,042
Admit it, Shinichi!!

1711
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:44,500
A thief is a thief,

1712
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,042
and not good!

1713
01:35:46,042 --> 01:35:47,917
Please, Shinichi!!

1714
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,083
Okay...!!

1715
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,750
Then...

1716
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:03,250
If you give me the treasure that I want most,

1717
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,208
I'll turn myself into the police.

1718
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:08,208
Huh?... But, I have nothing.

1719
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:09,542
Shh

1720
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:11,625
That is, of course...

1721
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,167
Huh?

1722
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:15,917
Oh, wait, wait,

1723
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,250
Hey...

1724
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:37,000
You're not Shinichi!?!

1725
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:44,000
Conan.

1726
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,875
Thief Kid, why you!!

1727
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:47,583
Yes...

1728
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,083
I'm not a detective, but a thief...

1729
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:55,042
The job of a thief is to steal...

1730
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:57,708
Be it the heart of a person.

1731
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:13,125
Dear Thief Kid, you're fantastic.

1732
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,583
Being told that after what he's done,

1733
01:41:14,583 --> 01:41:16,250
blows everything...

1734
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:18,875
Huh? What did he do?

1735
01:41:20,792 --> 01:41:24,875
Oh, Thief Kid returned the Lady Sky,
right...?

1736
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:27,708
Uh, what did Thief Kid do to you?

1737
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:30,458
Something that Shinichi would never do.

1738
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,417
What?

1739
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:35,667
Why...?

1740
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:37,792
Why wouldn't Shinichi ever do it?

1741
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:39,458
What made you think so?

1742
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:42,917
So, that's...

1743
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:50,875
It, It's not because I like him, you know!

1744
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:52,375
Don't get me wrong!!

1745
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:55,792
What?...

1746
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:01,125
H, Hey, Ran!!

1747
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:03,917
Hey, hey...

1748
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:07,542
what the hell does a thing like that
mean anyway...
