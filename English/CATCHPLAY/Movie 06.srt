1
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:55,669
Goodbye, my friend.

2
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,976
Hiroki!

3
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,046
Hiroki!

4
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:39,579
I wonder if I'll be able to
fly like Noah's Ark, too...

5
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,425
Hiroki!

6
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:43,019
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.

7
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:47,423
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

8
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:52,261
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal with a man dressed in black!

9
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,296
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

10
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,300
that I didn't notice a second
man sneak up from behind me!

11
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:03,740
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

12
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:06,608
...my body had shrunk!

13
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:10,813
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

14
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,750
putting all the people around me in danger!

15
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:17,286
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

16
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,223
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

17
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,925
To get information on the men,

18
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,952
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

19
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:32,334
- Ready, everyone?!
- Yeah!

20
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:36,405
Aside from the Doc, the only one
in this group who knows who I am...

21
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:40,276
...is Haibara Ai.

22
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,012
She originally worked with the men in black,

23
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:48,708
but to escape from them, she took
the same poison I did and shrank!

24
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:10,506
My parents are so childish
and always love to pull pranks.

25
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,811
My dad is the world-renowned
mystery novelist, Kudo Yusaku.

26
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:19,339
There's no mystery fan who hasn't
heard of his Night Baron series!

27
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,385
My mom, Kudo Yukiko,

28
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,957
was a legendary idol actress
who retired at 20 to get married.

29
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,984
She's just an annoying
middle-aged lady now, though.

30
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:37,834
For the time being, I'm a
"distant relative" of theirs.

31
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:43,405
I haven't seen them in a while.
I wonder how my mom and dad are...

32
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,407
I'm just dandy!

33
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:50,712
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

34
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,739
There is always only one truth!

35
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:05,862
We're here at Beika City Hall,
at the spectacular premier

36
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:09,866
of the sensory simulation game
developed by Japanese game makers

37
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,894
in cooperation with the Schindler Company!

38
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:23,036
Oh! President Schindler of the
Schindler Company has just arrived!

39
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:35,958
Now, then! According to the
documents distributed to the media,

40
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:41,263
players enter capsules called "Cocoons"

41
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:49,271
and interact with virtual reality
worlds while in a hypnotic state

42
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,741
in this conglomeration of
cutting-edge technology!

43
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:58,714
This game is said to have five types
of stages the player can enjoy.

44
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:02,584
Just what kind of virtual
worlds they are will be revealed

45
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:09,725
when the children at today's
sneak preview play for the first time!

46
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:12,761
Fifty boys and girls at
or below high school age

47
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,788
will be the first in Japan
to experience the Cocoons!

48
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:25,474
Geez! This is a bit much for some
stupid video game presentation!

49
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:31,313
I hear they had to put up with corporate
spies and stuff like that just to get this far!

50
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:37,010
Yeah, the Cocoons are supposed
to change video games forever!

51
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:41,423
What're those?!

52
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:44,193
Oh! Are those the Cocoons?!

53
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,963
I want to play in one...

54
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:51,300
I'm afraid you can't.
We were invited to the party,

55
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,536
but we weren't chosen to try the Cocoons.

56
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,208
But being able to experience actual,
historical events inside the games

57
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:00,842
is somewhat interesting.

58
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:01,678
Yeah, huh?!

59
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:05,647
It'd be like taking a journey
as a real-life time traveler!

60
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,616
C'mon, it's just a game!

61
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,786
Oh, yeah. I forgot you're bad
at computer games, Conan-kun.

62
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,290
Yeah, I can't believe
you're still stuck in Final Quest!

63
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:17,659
Yeah, you're surprisingly
not good with your fingers!

64
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,352
Shut up.

65
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,709
So many people, so much booze!

66
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:39,148
Dad! Important police officials are here!
Don't drink too much!

67
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,986
Yeah, yeah! You can't get
sick from expensive liquor!

68
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,922
That's not what she means...

69
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:49,391
This is all-you-can-eat, right?!

70
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,726
Yes, probably...

71
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,594
Lucky! Lucky!

72
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,288
Those kids are the lucky ones.

73
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,735
Seeing them receive their
game badges really hits home

74
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,539
that they're lucky they
get to play today's game...

75
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,874
The assistant commissioner's grandson,

76
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,277
a financial big shot's grandson,

77
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,612
the son of a politician from the ruling party...

78
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:15,451
Japan's future will be on these guys'
shoulders in the next generation!

79
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,354
- I'm sensing jealous looks!
- Yeah!

80
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,556
It's as if Japan's horrid hereditary system

81
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,126
has been concentrated in this one location.

82
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,531
It's due to that very system that
society repeats its transgressions.

83
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:33,602
Haibara-san, I don't
understand what you're saying.

84
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:37,739
Hey, now! Talk more like a kid!

85
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,542
Politicians' sons will become politicians.

86
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:43,112
CEOs' sons will become CEOs.

87
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:47,140
Japan will never change like this.

88
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:54,114
They said tons of that junk
on the news yesterday, anyway!

89
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,828
How was that?

90
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,187
Scary...

91
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,664
Ran!

92
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,666
Sonoko!

93
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,303
Hi, boys and girls!

94
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:10,106
Sonoko-san! Don't tell me that badge is-!

95
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,440
Oh, this?

96
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,110
Are you a chosen one too, Sonoko?!

97
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:18,580
The Suzuki zaibatsu helped fund
the game development, you see.

98
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,249
She's so lucky...

99
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:21,750
I wish I had one...

100
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,785
Forget it.

101
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,587
It's not your place.

102
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:29,591
Were you guys even invited here to begin with?

103
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:34,796
How rude! I invited these guests myself!

104
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,135
Why, hello there,
daughter of the Suzuki zaibatsu.

105
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,940
Listen. People's lives are set in
stone the moment they're born.

106
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:49,611
That's right! Like they say,
"Sharp clothes choose the wearer!"

107
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:55,684
Those not chosen can simply
look on enviously from the outside.

108
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,654
These creeps really tick me off.

109
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,681
Dad! Give them a talking to!

110
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:10,666
Listen, lads. You mustn't take life lightly.

111
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,204
Even the most stable of lives have pitfalls.

112
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,840
Someday, when you've become adults,
you will understand this.

113
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:22,711
Like having your wife run out on you?

114
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,814
I know all about you, old man.

115
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,816
You got the nickname "Sleeping Kogoro"

116
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,844
because your wife left you
while you were asleep, right?

117
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,858
You little brats!

118
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,395
He wasn't asleep!

119
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,665
My mom left him while he was in the bathroom!

120
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,024
Right?!

121
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,605
That's not helping him.

122
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,631
Hey! Let's have a little game!

123
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,679
When I think about kids like them
following their parents' footsteps

124
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:02,518
and becoming Japan's leaders,
I feel no hope for the future.

125
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,876
Agreed.

126
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,754
I got it! I got it!

127
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,871
- What's the big idea?!
- Give it back!

128
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,541
You're bothering the other guests.

129
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,876
If you're going to play, take it outside.

130
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,778
And just who are you?

131
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:33,415
My name is Kashimura. I was in
charge of the Cocoons' development.

132
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,953
It was the money from my dad's
bank that let you finish the game!

133
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:43,959
Have your mothers and fathers not
taught you about public morality

134
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:48,297
or how to talk to your superiors?

135
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:49,798
You think you're so great!

136
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:52,100
No more money for you!

137
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,737
Do you not know who we are, old man?

138
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:59,975
Defy us, and you might find
yourself without a job tomorrow.

139
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:06,415
In that case, perhaps I'll throw
you out of here before then.

140
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,773
Let's go.

141
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,425
What a cool man!

142
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,784
Unlike someone else I know.

143
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:45,053
Shinichi-kun should be here, too.

144
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:48,557
I'm sure you'd like to have
some family time with him.

145
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:52,294
Doc, please keep my relation to him a secret.

146
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:53,653
Yes, I know.

147
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:58,199
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please turn your attention to the stage!

148
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,202
Kudo Yusaku-sensei has
just arrived from America!

149
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:05,731
He kindly provided many ideas
used to create the Cocoon games!

150
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,851
We finally made it back.

151
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,754
You were working with Dad, huh?

152
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,589
I wondered why you were gone for a month.

153
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:23,859
I helped out with some
of the final programming.

154
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,026
What about my mom?

155
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,566
She hasn't been in Japan for a while,
so she's having a class reunion.

156
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,592
Here. A souvenir for you.

157
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,672
A game participation badge?

158
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:40,842
I appreciate it, but I can't play it on my own.

159
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:44,179
I think you'd really love it.

160
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:46,882
It's still a secret...

161
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:51,853
...but the game takes place 100 years ago,
in 19th-century London.

162
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,423
London 100 years ago?!

163
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:58,460
I see Dad still loves that
setting as much as ever...

164
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,486
Like father, like son.

165
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:10,271
Huh? I can't see a thing...

166
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,807
Sorry.

167
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:14,333
Geez! Don't move around in the darkness!

168
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:26,579
Introducing the next generation
gaming machine, the Cocoon!

169
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,429
This capsule controls the five senses,

170
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,431
and places players in a realistic world

171
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:39,901
where everything from touch
to pain to smell are experienced!

172
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:43,572
As it electrically acts upon
the central nervous system,

173
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:45,507
there is no physical damage to the body.

174
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:48,109
It's no fun just looking...

175
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,145
Yeah, games are for playing...

176
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,981
Oh! You're all here!

177
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,917
In that case, I'll give you a
riddle to pass the boredom!

178
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,285
Eh?!

179
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:00,822
Not another of the Doc's horrible pun riddles!

180
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:01,923
Should we run for it?

181
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:05,618
I'm sure he tried hard
thinking it up! Let's hear him out!

182
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:09,665
Mr. A, an employee of this game company,

183
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,935
became captivated with
the Cocoon game during work.

184
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,338
What did the company
president do after seeing Mr. A?

185
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:21,943
Did he 1: award him for finishing the game;

186
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:25,947
2: fire him for playing games during work;

187
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:32,287
or 3: leave him as-is, since he was
sleeping soundly in the Cocoon.

188
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,456
Number 3! He let him sleep!

189
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,324
Why's that?

190
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,561
Because the Cocoon looks like a cradle!

191
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:40,962
Bzzz!

192
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,231
I say it's Number 1, the award!

193
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:44,966
That gets a "bzzzz" too!

194
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,203
Then it's Number 2? How come?

195
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:52,874
I take it you know, Ai-kun?
Could you explain it for them?

196
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:56,077
I'm wearing light clothing today.
Edogawa-kun can do it.

197
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,212
Eh?

198
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,748
Sounds like you have a request.

199
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,983
"Cocoon" refers to the insect cocoons.

200
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,720
Kaiko create cocoons. [Silkworms]

201
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,989
And kaiko is another way to say "fire."

202
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:08,990
Brr!

203
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:12,093
I'm gonna get something warm to drink...

204
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:14,896
- I'll come with you...
- Me too...

205
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,592
Huh? Is the air conditioning
on too high for them?

206
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,052
These bronze statues are quite magnificent!

207
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:41,122
I hear they're Mr. Schindler's
favorites from his collection!

208
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:46,127
Oh? He must really like them
to bring them all the way here!

209
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:52,157
Perhaps he shares the fighting
spirit that flows from such statues.

210
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:00,408
- Uh oh!
- Hideki!

211
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,544
Quit playing ball inside.

212
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:03,903
Okay...

213
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,717
I guess we screwed up, huh?

214
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:12,087
It's nothin'. They're all cheap statues.

215
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,421
Are you serious?

216
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,457
They'd never put anything that expensive here.

217
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:18,493
Yeah, that's true!

218
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,230
Kashimura Tadaaki, the man in
charge of the Cocoon's development,

219
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,966
was a partner in crime of mine in college,

220
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,470
so I was able to rekindle our old
friendship through this latest job.

221
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,439
Thank you!

222
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:35,110
This has been Shimizu of TMS!

223
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:38,079
Where might I find Kashimura?
I'd like to see him.

224
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:42,150
Right! I'll find him right away!

225
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:44,152
Kudo-sensei! Could I have your autograph?!

226
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:45,510
Me too!

227
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,995
I'm relieved to see you're well.

228
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,354
Likewise.

229
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,504
"Kashimura's Room"

230
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,899
I must return to the conference soon.
Let's make this quick.

231
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:36,571
How much will you sell Hiroki's
"DNA Search Program" for?

232
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:39,908
I do not intend to extort you.

233
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,601
I simply want you to
atone for what you've done!

234
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:51,252
Hiroki learned the secret about you
that can ruin the Schindler Empire.

235
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:56,257
But the artificial brain couldn't
be completed without Hiroki's help.

236
00:20:56,281 --> 00:21:01,997
You forced Hiroki to work harder to complete it.

237
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,532
Having been mentally run ragged,

238
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:10,238
he believed you would kill him
the instant he finished the brain.

239
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:14,009
That's why he let the Noah's Ark,
practically his electronic double,

240
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,177
escape over the phone lines

241
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,704
and threw himself over the roof
of that apartment building.

242
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,186
Some time after that,

243
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,258
the DNA Search Program
file snuck onto my computer.

244
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:35,030
It was the doing of Noah's Ark,
acting out Hiroki's will.

245
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:39,200
It seemed to me like
the scream of Hiroki's soul.

246
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,202
I will atone.

247
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,304
I will reveal everything to the public,

248
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:46,207
and accept whatever judgment I'm given.

249
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:49,544
But, before that, could I
see this DNA Search Program

250
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:54,215
that Noah's Ark supposedly sent you?

251
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,908
Very well.

252
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:20,665
This phantom of London has truly
transcended time, to the modern-

253
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,844
My name is Noah's Ark.

254
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:50,866
Sir? Kudo-sensei would like to see you.

255
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,700
Sir?

256
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,502
Pardon the intrusion, sir.

257
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:56,862
Sir! What happened?! Sir!

258
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:08,449
Now what're they gonna do?

259
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:10,451
Now, please enjoy this live performance

260
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:14,289
from our special guest today, Okino Yoko-san!

261
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:17,458
What?! Yoko-chan's here, too?!

262
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,985
Those front row seats are mine!

263
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:28,469
Chiba-kun, seal all exits.

264
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:30,138
Understood!

265
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,940
Attention, all units on standby!

266
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:34,475
Many important people
seem to be in attendance.

267
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:38,914
Yes. The assistant commissioner,
financial big-wigs,

268
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:42,317
and even several legislative officials.

269
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:45,253
Sounds like we'll have to be especially careful.

270
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,055
Tadah!

271
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,456
Whoa!

272
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,458
Golden Yaiba Cards!

273
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:51,893
They're limited edition!

274
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:53,594
I want one!

275
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,065
We'll trade them for your
game badges, if you want!

276
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,800
But we wanna play the game, too...

277
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:02,303
You can always play the
Cocoons some other day,

278
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:07,242
but this might be your only
chance to get a Golden Yaiba Card!

279
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,644
What do we do?

280
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:12,313
Haibara! We got some!

281
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,782
Here! There's one for you, too!

282
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,476
Oh! How impressive!

283
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,447
I guess it could make for a
decent conversation piece.

284
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:26,451
Excuse me! Please let me through!

285
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,265
Eh?! Kashimura is?!

286
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:33,368
- Please take me there!
- Right!

287
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:38,539
Now, then! Let us move to the Cocoon hall!

288
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:41,566
I don't see Dad anywhere. Where did he go?

289
00:25:44,203 --> 00:25:46,381
Inspector!

290
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:49,017
Oh! Mori-kun! You're here, too?

291
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:53,654
I saw police cars from the balcony
after my tipsiness wore off, so...!

292
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,557
Wasn't he in charge of
the Cocoons' development?

293
00:25:56,581 --> 00:26:00,962
One stab to the heart.
The weapon was taken from the scene.

294
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:03,298
The blood was wiped off...

295
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:05,466
Was the weapon something important?

296
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,994
Or would it identify the killer if left behind?

297
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:16,211
But why would the head of development
work here in the basement?

298
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:22,074
He said he couldn't concentrate
where people constantly come and go.

299
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:29,657
There's blood on the R, T, and J!

300
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:33,528
Umm, one thing does puzzle me...

301
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:37,098
All the files on the hard
drive have been destroyed!

302
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:38,067
Files?

303
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:40,501
Sabotage by a rival company?!

304
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,670
Wouldn't it be too late?

305
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:45,273
After all, the Cocoons are already complete!

306
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:47,108
When did you get in here?!

307
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:50,911
Say, isn't that a dying message on the keyboard?

308
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:52,604
What?!

309
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,683
There's blood on the keys!
He must've pressed them as he was dying!

310
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:58,419
R, T, and J...

311
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:02,723
If it was JR and JT... Trains and cigarettes?

312
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:10,298
RTJ... TJR... TRJ... JTR...

313
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:12,067
JTR?!

314
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:15,603
London, 100 years ago?

315
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,961
It couldn't be!

316
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:37,825
Isn't that Conan-kun?

317
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,184
Eh?

318
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:44,499
Why is Conan-kun in line to play the game?

319
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,267
Here you are!

320
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,236
You can take it, you know!

321
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,240
You're concerned about him,
aren't you? As his guardian.

322
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:54,742
But what about you?

323
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:58,103
It's fine! I don't care
about this stuff in the least!

324
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,641
Upsy-daisy!

325
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:07,322
All 50 participants in place.

326
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:10,258
Brain Gear in place.

327
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:12,360
Closing capsule lids.

328
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:14,495
Accessing host hardware.

329
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,996
Entering block code.

330
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,632
Connecting couplers.

331
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,100
Adjusting coordinate axes.

332
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:22,103
Point correction complete. Locked on.

333
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:24,205
Activating Fade-In System.

334
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,641
Power set complete.

335
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,333
Start the game!

336
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,247
It has to be in this game!
The key to solving this murder case!

337
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,653
Kashimura!

338
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:55,303
I hear you and Kashimura-san go way back.

339
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:58,330
Can you think of anyone who
might hold a grudge against him?

340
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:05,813
Is that bespectacled boy not with you?

341
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:08,816
Huh? Oh, Conan?

342
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,885
He was just here,

343
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:16,023
but he turned pale after seeing
the dying message on the keyboard...

344
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,716
Dying message?

345
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,064
JTR!

346
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:28,669
What?! You don't think
Conan-kun used my souvenir to...?!

347
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:29,870
Let's go, Doc!

348
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:35,510
H-Hold on, Yusaku-kun!
What do those three letters mean?!

349
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:42,116
JTR. Those are the initials of
a certain character in the game.

350
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,689
It's the name Kashimura and I
used to refer to Jack the Ripper.

351
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:51,426
J-Jack the Ripper?!

352
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:58,098
Yes. The real-life murderer
who lived in 19th-century London.

353
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:02,537
A psychotic killer who
murdered five women with a knife

354
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:03,704
and terrorized London to its core.

355
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,707
The London Police were never able to catch him,

356
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:10,711
and his serial murder cases went unsolved.

357
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:15,716
From Kashimura's dying message,
Conan-kun likely surmised

358
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,077
that there is a clue about
our killer inside the game!

359
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:27,728
President Schindler, this is
Inspector Megure, of the Metro Police.

360
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:31,466
Police? Why are you here?

361
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,502
I must ask that you stop the game for now.

362
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:37,772
Stop? Don't be ridiculous.

363
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,908
Sir! The system is malfunctioning!

364
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:41,843
What?!

365
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,202
I've lost control of it!

366
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,805
Pardon me!

367
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,654
What the-?!

368
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:56,014
Ran! You're doing it too?!

369
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,787
My name is Noah's Ark.

370
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:07,602
My name is Noah's Ark.

371
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,937
The game can't be stopped now.

372
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:14,475
I have seized control of the
sensory simulation Cocoon game.

373
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,512
W-What is "Noah's Ark"?

374
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:23,784
An artificial brain that matures five
years for each normal year, right?

375
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,219
Yes.

376
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:32,327
Hiroki, the boy I cherished like a
real son, finished it two years ago.

377
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,687
So it's the same age as Hiroki now...

378
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:44,138
Noah's Ark! Why have you seized
control of the children's game?!

379
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:49,977
My goal is to reset the nation of Japan.

380
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,336
What?

381
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:04,825
Conan-kun!

382
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,828
R-Ran-neechan! Why are you here?

383
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:10,097
Because I was worried about you!

384
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,932
- Conan-kun!
- Yo!

385
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:13,868
You guys, too?!

386
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,838
It was tough getting here!

387
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:21,942
After all you said, you still
wanted to play the game, huh?

388
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,845
I-I guess.

389
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:30,017
Still, for being in a hypnotic state,
it certainly doesn't feel like it...

390
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,887
It's like a dream,
being able to do whatever we want!

391
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:35,756
It's just the opposite.

392
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,696
Our sight, sound, smell, taste, touch...

393
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,723
It's all controlled by the computer now.

394
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:52,330
Now then, Cocoon pioneers!
The game's about to begin!

395
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:57,277
My name is Noah's Ark. Nice to meet you.

396
00:32:57,301 --> 00:33:00,247
Nice to meet you!

397
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:03,784
I'm going to show previews
of each of the five stages

398
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:06,454
so you can choose a world you'd like to play in.

399
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:12,226
But I must warn you,
this is no ordinary video game.

400
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,730
In this game, your lives are at stake!

401
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,998
Our lives?

402
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:23,137
If everyone loses the game, you'll be
unable to return to the real world.

403
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:26,106
So you have to play seriously.

404
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,411
But if even one person
reaches the goal, you all win,

405
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:34,415
and everyone, including
those who got a "game over,"

406
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:37,452
will wake up in the real world again.

407
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:41,489
These are the rules I decided on.
Do you understand them?

408
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:42,990
What does that mean?

409
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:45,760
If everyone gets a "game over,"

410
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:51,832
I'll send out a special EM
signal to destroy your brains.

411
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:56,771
In other words, this is a match to
see if Japan should be reset or not.

412
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:59,674
What do you mean by "resetting Japan"?!

413
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:03,978
I know you can't hear voices
from people in the real world,

414
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,314
but I'm going to answer a
question an adult just asked.

415
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,049
As I look at you, I realize

416
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:13,353
the sons of corrupt politicians will
grow up to be corrupt politicians,

417
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:18,493
and the sons of money-grubbing
doctors will grow up to be the same.

418
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:23,187
To fix Japan, that link needs to be cut.

419
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:30,037
I've heard enough! What right do
you have to toy with people's lives?!

420
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:32,039
I have no right.

421
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:36,067
Just as the adults had no right
to toy with Hiroki-kun's life.

422
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:43,542
Well, the children are waiting,
so let's start the game!

423
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:48,989
The first stage is "Vikings."

424
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:52,993
You'll become Vikings, sail the seven seas,

425
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:58,398
and use determination and bravery
to take on numerous adventures.

426
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:02,169
The second stage is the "Paris-Dakar Rally."

427
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:04,905
You'll compete with world-famous drivers

428
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:07,932
in an intense race to the finish line.

429
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,548
The third stage is the "Colosseum."

430
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,116
You'll obtain powerful weapons and armor

431
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,186
and test your might in the Roman Empire.

432
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,213
You'll defeat challenging
gladiators and move on.

433
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:26,484
The fourth is "Solomon's Treasures."

434
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,132
You'll become treasure hunters.

435
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:37,538
You'll search for the treasures of
Solomon, hidden all over the world.

436
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:41,275
And the fifth is "Old Time London."

437
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:45,379
Here, you'll enjoy a horror-like suspense story.

438
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:48,048
London, 1888.

439
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:51,051
You will catch Jack the Ripper,

440
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:57,081
the real-life serial murderer
whose incidents were never solved.

441
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,099
It sounds like there really
might be something here...

442
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:09,136
A clue about the person who
murdered Kashimura-san...

443
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,073
Are we really gonna die if
we all get a "game over"?

444
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:16,677
Why does it have to be us?

445
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:20,414
It's not like I asked to
be my father's daughter...

446
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:23,618
I don't think I can stay alive...

447
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:27,454
Someone stay alive! Get me out of here!

448
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:31,458
Cheer up, everyone!
Don't lose before you even start!

449
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:35,696
Yeah! Only one of us has to reach the goal!

450
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,800
Choose whichever stage you
think you're most likely to survive!

451
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,335
Guess we got no choice.

452
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,038
Moroboshi-kun! Which stage?!

453
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:45,396
Whatever.

454
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:50,310
"Solomon's Treasures"

455
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:54,815
"Paris-Dakar Rally"

456
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,508
"Old Time London"

457
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,155
We're stuck with you?

458
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,657
You'd better not slow us down!

459
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,859
That's our line!

460
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:06,727
Now, now! No fighting!

461
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:11,565
There are assist characters in each stage.
You can rely on them.

462
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,801
Now let the game begin!

463
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:15,827
Okay! Let's go!

464
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,584
Well, Doc?!

465
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:35,890
Immense energy is indeed
stored inside each Cocoon.

466
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:40,260
More than enough to
destroy the brains of 50 people.

467
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:43,397
I've had enough! I'm taking my son and leaving!

468
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:46,667
I believe I'll do the same!

469
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:50,004
- S-Sir!
- Out of my way!

470
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,696
No! Stop them!

471
00:37:58,202 --> 00:38:00,204
Are you all right?!

472
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,383
No one may disrupt the game.

473
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:07,888
That was a light shock just now,
but I won't hold back next time!

474
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,190
Damn it! I can't believe this guy!

475
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:12,592
Still, President Schindler.

476
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:18,232
Why is the artificial brain
Hiroki-kun built running amok like this?

477
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,758
I-I'm not...

478
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:23,938
Allow me to answer.

479
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,741
The reason Hiroki-kun left
his father in the first place

480
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,276
to live with his mother in America

481
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,380
was because of the barriers in
the Japanese education system.

482
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:34,882
Hold it, Hiroki!

483
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:37,617
I said you could rest
because of your frail health,

484
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:41,121
but I didn't say you could
play on your computer!

485
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:45,125
In the eyes of Japan's strict,
anti-individuality educational system,

486
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:49,830
Hiroki-kun was nothing more
than a creepy computer geek.

487
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:51,766
And it's not just the education system.

488
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,403
The very nation itself
attempts to ignore individuality.

489
00:38:56,427 --> 00:39:00,074
Hiroki-kun decided to
develop an artificial brain

490
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:03,243
because of the bitter
experiences he had gone through.

491
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:07,081
In short, since Hiroki-kun committed suicide

492
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:11,318
before he could find a way to "reset" Japan,

493
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:14,321
the artificial, ever-maturing brain,
Noah's Ark, while on the run,

494
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:18,793
must have taken up the cause in
his place and discovered a way:

495
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:25,099
this game presentation, where
Japan's future leaders would gather.

496
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:28,102
The idea being that Japan can be
changed by destroying its society,

497
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:31,371
in which children simply need to
follow tracks laid by their parents.

498
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:35,375
How do you know all that, Kudo-sensei?!

499
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:41,381
The truth is, Kashimura and I were
client and detective this past year.

500
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,350
D-Detective?!

501
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:46,120
What did he hire you to do?

502
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:49,356
To reinvestigate Hiroki-kun's suicide.

503
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,893
You're saying he was murdered?
That it wasn't a suicide?

504
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,463
No. In those circumstances,
it probably was a suicide.

505
00:39:56,487 --> 00:40:01,969
But Kashimura asked me to look
into what drove him to suicide.

506
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:04,538
How were Kashimura-san
and Hiroki-kun related?

507
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:08,208
Kashimura was Hiroki-kun's father.

508
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,234
Isn't that right?

509
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,150
Kashimura felt deeply
responsible for being separated

510
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:21,012
from his young son and allowing
him to die in that manner.

511
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,451
Conan-kun and the others
are about to enter Whitechapel!

512
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,733
W-W-We go in here?

513
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:35,426
Let's go!

514
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,933
Please hurry up!

515
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:45,579
What's the big idea?!

516
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:47,939
That's what you get for being slow!

517
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:56,523
This is London, the foggy city?
It's more creepy than romantic...

518
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:59,259
The air seems dirty, too...

519
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,595
And it smells.

520
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,901
London's fog isn't just clean,
condensed moisture vapor.

521
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:10,370
It's fog mixed with smoke and
soot from burnt coal and oil...

522
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:12,439
Smog, in other words.

523
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:16,643
Eh?! Smog existed even in these times?

524
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,645
Jack the Ripper!

525
00:41:18,669 --> 00:41:20,671
H-Hey! Conan!

526
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,611
Stop!

527
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,450
Oh, no, you don't!

528
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,564
Oww! Oww!

529
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,099
Are you okay, Conan-kun?

530
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,068
Y-Yeah.

531
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:45,940
I guess Dr. Agasa's inventions
don't work in the game world.

532
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,942
Yeah. This antenna goes up,

533
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:51,970
but these glasses and this watch
are otherwise ordinary now...

534
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:58,785
What is he saying?

535
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,145
It sounds like English...

536
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:04,959
Please change it to Japanese!

537
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,317
Right!

538
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:09,763
Huh? What's going on?!

539
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:12,532
Another victim! That makes three now!

540
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,969
Oh! It's in Japanese now!

541
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:17,504
It's almost like the real world!

542
00:42:17,528 --> 00:42:21,775
What we see, what we hear,
the chill in the air... it's all real!

543
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:24,344
The pain in my foot was real, too.

544
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:26,180
Alright, move aside!

545
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,206
Step back, please!

546
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:31,485
Hey! Contact Inspector Lestrade at once!

547
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:33,453
Right!

548
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:35,855
Inspector Lestrade?!

549
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:38,825
Doc! Can we communicate with them?!

550
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,727
I'll give it a try.

551
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:43,863
If you helped oversee this game,

552
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:47,167
then you know how they can complete it, right?

553
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:54,008
Yes. If I can just communicate with them,
I can tell them what to do.

554
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:59,679
Then we can't lose! This stage will be a cinch!

555
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:04,851
But, if Noah's Ark is
anticipating far ahead, then...

556
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,388
Doc! I leave the rest to you!
I'm going to the scene!

557
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:09,747
Got it!

558
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:20,934
Sheesh. We're supposed to catch this guy?
Where do we even start?

559
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,837
I guess all we can do is wait until morning.

560
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:25,672
I'm cold...

561
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:26,673
Put this on.

562
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:29,367
- Oh! Are you sure?!
- Yeah.

563
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:32,879
I'm warm!

564
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,582
Haibara-san! Here you are!

565
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:38,518
- Oh! Thank you!
- My pleasure!

566
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:39,953
Put this on!

567
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:41,755
But what about you?

568
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:44,291
I'm fine! I'm sensitive to heat!

569
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:45,649
Thanks!

570
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,100
Can you hear me, Conan-kun? It's me, Agasa!

571
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,701
We hear you, Doc!

572
00:43:54,725 --> 00:44:01,108
Listen closely! If you get hurt or
caught by the police in that stage,

573
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:03,543
the game is over for you!

574
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:08,115
Right now, you're in the
Whitechapel district on the East End.

575
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:10,717
There's an assist character...

576
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:11,885
...until...

577
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:13,387
What happened?

578
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:16,080
What happened, Doc?! We can't hear you!

579
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,329
Grab on!

580
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,432
Conan! You can do it!

581
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:42,005
That was close!

582
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:51,491
It seems you still don't understand.
The game is entirely in my control.

583
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:54,428
There's no use in trying to outfox me.

584
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:57,431
I'll allow you to hear them, though.

585
00:44:57,455 --> 00:45:01,768
Enjoy the sounds of the children's suffering!

586
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:04,795
What a screwed-up computer this is!

587
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,609
The doc's voice is gone now...

588
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:12,712
It seems Noah's Ark has cut
our line of communication.

589
00:45:12,736 --> 00:45:16,983
Then how do we find this assist character?!

590
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:20,019
That policeman told us just now!

591
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:23,022
He said, "Contact Inspector Lestrade!"

592
00:45:23,046 --> 00:45:26,193
Wait, you mean the
Inspector Lestrade from that story?!

593
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:30,630
But he was just a character in one
of Conan Doyle's mystery novels!

594
00:45:30,654 --> 00:45:35,369
This game might be a mix of reality and fiction.

595
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:37,804
Then, is our assist character...?

596
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:42,376
Yeah. He's gotta be here. Sherlock Holmes!

597
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,043
Really?!

598
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:45,679
We're unstoppable with Holmes on our side!

599
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:48,182
This stage is as good as beat!

600
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:51,485
Let's hurry to Baker Street!

601
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:53,653
That's it. If you can just meet with Holmes...

602
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:59,350
But it's quite a long way from
Whitechapel to Baker Street...

603
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:13,864
Hey. Doesn't that clock seem weird?

604
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:21,681
It went backwards!

605
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:23,850
Oh! It did it again!

606
00:46:23,874 --> 00:46:29,356
From 50 minutes to 49 minutes?
And then to 48?

607
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,427
I get it! That's the number of kids in the game!

608
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:35,362
It went back two minutes...

609
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:38,389
Which means two people in
another stage are out of the game...

610
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:54,781
Yasuhiro!

611
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:57,140
Two down in the Viking stage!

612
00:47:01,812 --> 00:47:02,757
Tomoyuki!

613
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:03,947
M-Mineko!

614
00:47:04,748 --> 00:47:07,894
Two more in the Colosseum stage!

615
00:47:07,918 --> 00:47:12,732
Faster! Lose the game faster!

616
00:47:12,756 --> 00:47:18,929
If the children discover who
Jack the Ripper is, I'm done for.

617
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,479
Three down in the Solomon stage!

618
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:27,505
That leaves 43...

619
00:47:33,511 --> 00:47:34,688
Wait.

620
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:38,792
I hear there was another victim
in a back alley by Mitre Street.

621
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:42,596
Two in one hour. That's four now.

622
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,332
The world's a horrible place...

623
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:46,700
This is scary.

624
00:47:46,724 --> 00:47:49,836
We came to a terrible time period.

625
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,773
The turn of the century is said
to have been London's finest era

626
00:47:53,797 --> 00:47:55,775
in the history of the British Empire,

627
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:58,978
but in actuality, there was a
disparaging gap between rich and poor,

628
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:04,718
crime was rampant, and the
people's hearts were unruly.

629
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:07,887
Come to think of it,
Shinichi told me about that.

630
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:10,957
He said if Sherlock Holmes
was the light of the era,

631
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:13,793
Jack the Ripper was the dark shadow.

632
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:16,963
Then let's hurry to the light of the era!

633
00:48:16,987 --> 00:48:18,989
We're almost to Baker Street!

634
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:27,707
♪ Beware Jack the Ripper... ♪

635
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:32,812
♪ He's waiting for you
on the streets at night... ♪

636
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:38,585
♪ What should you do if
you don't want to die? ♪

637
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:43,823
♪ You need to get covered in blood, too... ♪

638
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,659
What could that mean?

639
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:48,928
Kill before being killed, I'd say.

640
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,621
Covered in blood?

641
00:48:57,695 --> 00:49:02,509
There's a metal detector at the
entrance to the presentation hall...

642
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:05,869
How did the killer bring the murder weapon in?

643
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:18,892
It's nothin'. They're all cheap statues.

644
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:19,926
Are you serious?

645
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,953
They'd never put anything that expensive here.

646
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:34,598
221-B. This is it.

647
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:42,115
This is where the Sherlock Holmes lives?

648
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:46,085
It's a lodging house he and Dr. Watson rent!

649
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,154
At this late hour? Who might you be?

650
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:54,093
U-Umm, my name is Mori Ran.
We'd like to see Holmes-san...

651
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:57,797
Holmes-san and Dr. Watson
are gone on a business trip.

652
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:58,666
Business trip?

653
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,468
Yes. In a place called
Dartmoor, out in the country.

654
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:04,003
I'm sorry to ask, but what day is today?

655
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:06,305
September 30th.

656
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:10,910
September 30th? Dartmoor?

657
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:14,013
Oh, yeah! The Hound of the Baskervilles case!

658
00:50:14,037 --> 00:50:18,952
That's right! Neither of
them is in London right now!

659
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:20,954
C'mon, Doc...

660
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,312
What's going on?!

661
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:25,925
I'm sorry to ask, but could I
see the surveillance footage

662
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:28,161
from before and after the incident?

663
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:29,520
Of course.

664
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,367
Yes?

665
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:35,969
What's wrong?

666
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:39,305
It seems we underestimated Noah's Ark.

667
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:43,342
Neither Holmes nor Watson was on Baker Street.

668
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:46,279
So he did anticipate us...

669
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:50,950
There was also a strange accordion
player I don't remember creating.

670
00:50:50,974 --> 00:50:52,318
Things are becoming difficult.

671
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:56,956
Hey! What sort of story did
you come up with, Yusaku-kun?!

672
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,059
The players work with Sherlock Holmes

673
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:03,697
to discover Jack the Ripper's identity.

674
00:51:03,721 --> 00:51:11,304
The murderer turns out to be an
aristocrat with a terminal illness.

675
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:14,373
I've prepared an even better ending for you!

676
00:51:14,397 --> 00:51:20,904
Damn you! Once the kids win,
I'm throwing you into the garbage!

677
00:51:24,174 --> 00:51:26,176
Good luck, Shinichi.

678
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:33,684
Oh, you're the ones who
helped Holmes-san two weeks ago!

679
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:41,191
Come inside! I'll make you some warm milk tea!

680
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,540
She seems to think we're someone else.

681
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:51,845
Oh, yeah! She thinks we're
the Baker Street Irregulars!

682
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:53,379
Who are they?

683
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:57,016
They're the street urchins Holmes hired!

684
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,019
They were tough kids who'd
sneak into places adults couldn't go

685
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:02,021
and gather information for him!

686
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:06,259
Oh! So they're like the predecessors
of our Junior Detective League!

687
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:07,618
Pretty much!

688
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:11,555
Looks like they've managed to get inside.

689
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:20,439
- Wow!
- It's just like on TV!

690
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:22,075
It's so moving!

691
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:25,102
Shinichi will be so jealous
when he hears about this!

692
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,590
He looks just like Shinichi...

693
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:40,226
Oh, my! You look just like Holmes-san!

694
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,297
He's always sitting like that, deep in thought!

695
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:47,967
Oh! He was just mimicking Holmes!

696
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:51,070
Please make yourselves at
home while I prepare the tea!

697
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:52,763
Thank you!

698
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:58,177
Hey! Doesn't this look like someone?!

699
00:52:58,201 --> 00:53:02,015
Oh! It's Dr. Agasa, but with hair!

700
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:04,541
This must be Holmes and Dr. Watson!

701
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:12,792
Dad and the doc are totally playing around...

702
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:16,295
Hey. We don't have time to sit around.

703
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,498
But, Moroboshi-kun. What should we do?

704
00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:23,269
I'm sure Glasses knows.

705
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:28,174
Given how Holmes is, he must
have a big file on Jack the Ripper.

706
00:53:28,198 --> 00:53:30,777
Then let's split up and look for it!

707
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:34,881
Right! I'll look over here!

708
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:39,018
How're we supposed to find it?
This is all English...

709
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:43,657
Let's see....
"Initial Investigation for Crime"...

710
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:46,125
Whoa! I'm a genius!

711
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:47,894
I can read English!

712
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:48,962
Me too!

713
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:52,832
It seems the players are
programmed to be able to read English.

714
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:57,303
Bah. Then I wanna stay
inside the game forever...

715
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,238
Don't be stupid, Genta-kun!

716
00:53:59,262 --> 00:54:03,042
At this rate, we're going
to lose the game and die!

717
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:05,068
I-I'm just joking!

718
00:54:09,072 --> 00:54:10,741
What a filthy ball...

719
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,555
I-Is this...?!

720
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:20,226
Hey! Emori! This is a 100 year-old soccer ball!

721
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,594
Oh! It is?!

722
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:22,953
Eh?!

723
00:54:24,254 --> 00:54:26,256
I found it! Is this it?!

724
00:54:28,926 --> 00:54:32,271
"An Analysis of Jack the Ripper."

725
00:54:32,295 --> 00:54:37,076
The most recent previous
incident... was September 8th!

726
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:42,448
"The second victim was
Honey Charleston, age 41, single.

727
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:46,019
Her body was found in the barren
lot adjoining St. Mary's Church

728
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:48,087
in the Whitechapel district.

729
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:52,291
Two rings of different sizes
were also found at the scene."

730
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:54,651
Rings of different sizes?

731
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:59,232
"Given that Jack the Ripper
has terrorized London to its core

732
00:54:59,256 --> 00:55:02,301
and brought about
unprecedented social anxiety,

733
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:08,274
I am certain he is connected to
Professor Moriarty, architect of evil."

734
00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:10,243
Professor Moriarty?!

735
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:12,879
Even he's in the game?!

736
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,580
So?! Who's he?!

737
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:17,984
Don't keep it to yourselves!

738
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:20,319
He's Holmes' arch-nemesis.

739
00:55:20,343 --> 00:55:23,056
They say he controls
London's criminal underworld

740
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,226
and wields great influence over all of Europe.

741
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,628
He's the Napoleon of the criminal world!

742
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:33,066
But Professor Moriarty
usually only pulls the strings;

743
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,601
he almost never shows himself.

744
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,737
How are we supposed to find him?

745
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:43,342
If he won't show himself, we'll
find someone connected to him...

746
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:45,244
...Colonel Sebastian Moran!

747
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:49,248
Oh, yeah! Colonel Moran,
the professor's right-hand man!

748
00:55:49,272 --> 00:55:52,618
But how do we find the colonel?

749
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,087
I'm sure that's-

750
00:55:54,111 --> 00:56:00,093
According to Holmes' notes, his
base is the Trump Club downtown.

751
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:02,261
He's the second most
dangerous person in London,

752
00:56:02,285 --> 00:56:04,263
so we need to be careful meeting him!

753
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,633
Conan-kun, how do you know so much?

754
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:11,270
Oh, uhh, Shinichi-niichan was
always talking about this stuff!

755
00:56:11,294 --> 00:56:14,373
Oh! I should've guessed!

756
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:19,712
But that mystery nerd's blabbing
actually turned out to be useful here!

757
00:56:19,736 --> 00:56:22,072
You don't have to call it "blabbing..."

758
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:26,652
Whoa! A real gun!

759
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,454
Put it back, Genta!

760
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:32,225
B-But we're meeting a scary guy, right?

761
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:34,560
Weapons you don't know how to use are useless

762
00:56:34,584 --> 00:56:35,728
and only cause trouble!

763
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:36,963
Leave it!

764
00:56:36,987 --> 00:56:38,655
Y-You're scarier...

765
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:47,364
Alright! Let's go before it gets too late!

766
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:03,156
Hey! Moroboshi!

767
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,849
Gotta be able to protect myself.

768
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,437
30 people left...

769
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:20,506
It's gone down a lot...

770
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:24,343
I would guess members of our
group will soon be falling out, too.

771
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,369
Don't say unlucky stuff like that!

772
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:37,280
Toru!

773
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:39,359
Emi!

774
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:40,717
Takuya!

775
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:48,767
Okay. Wait here, everyone.

776
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,370
I'm going to check things
out from the back door.

777
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:53,396
- Be careful!
- Yeah.

778
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,417
One card.

779
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:17,063
I'll take two.

780
00:58:17,087 --> 00:58:18,755
It's Colonel Moran!

781
00:58:20,857 --> 00:58:22,525
That monkey!

782
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:31,410
Well, Glasses?

783
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:32,912
W-What are you doing here?!

784
00:58:32,936 --> 00:58:36,106
We can't let you hog all the credit!

785
00:58:39,276 --> 00:58:41,320
Straight!

786
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:42,956
So sorry.

787
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,457
Flush.

788
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:47,760
- What?!
- Tonight's my lucky night!

789
00:58:47,784 --> 00:58:49,452
Damn it!

790
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:53,166
Moran's awesome at poker...

791
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,433
He's cheating.

792
00:58:54,457 --> 00:58:56,835
- What?!
- You can tell?!

793
00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:01,274
That monkey is telling the colonel
what hand the other guy has.

794
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:02,275
It's been trained:

795
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:05,611
The right hand for hearts and spades,
the left for diamonds and clubs.

796
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:09,782
And then it eats the number
and color indicated on the cards.

797
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:14,653
The 3 of Spades would be three
black berries with the right hand.

798
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,555
That's cheap.

799
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:20,193
Huh? What's with that seat?

800
00:59:20,217 --> 00:59:21,660
And why is that there?

801
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,020
Cheater!

802
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:29,502
This Moran creep is a cheater!

803
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:33,572
You'd best watch your mouth, boy!

804
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:36,375
Or do you have proof I'm cheating?!

805
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:37,576
Of course!

806
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,880
You're good friends with
that monkey, aren't you?

807
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:43,416
What?!

808
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,918
It looked at his cards, and
when it was a 3 of Spades,

809
00:59:45,942 --> 00:59:48,154
it ate three black berries with its right hand,

810
00:59:48,178 --> 00:59:51,890
and for the 5 of Diamonds,
it ate five red berries with the left.

811
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:54,527
Moran! You cheated me!

812
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:56,495
It's your fault for falling for it.

813
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:57,930
What?!

814
00:59:57,954 --> 00:59:59,432
Whoops.

815
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:02,268
You can save your squabble for later.

816
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:05,071
Where is Professor Moriarty?

817
01:00:05,095 --> 01:00:08,074
Boy! Where did you hear his name?!

818
01:00:08,098 --> 01:00:09,432
Stop!

819
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:13,703
Catch those brats!

820
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:26,525
You damn kid!

821
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:28,561
Are you all right, Conan-kun?!

822
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:29,363
Yeah...

823
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,388
We're here to help, Conan!

824
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:41,907
Bottom's up!

825
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:45,911
This is bad! We're all in here!

826
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:47,937
Look out, Conan-kun!

827
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:53,752
Kikukawa-kun!

828
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,788
Hey! Hang in there!

829
01:00:55,812 --> 01:00:59,558
They got me. Now you and I are even.

830
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:00,917
Hey!

831
01:01:07,157 --> 01:01:08,491
Kikukawa...

832
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,031
Seiichiro!

833
01:01:20,637 --> 01:01:22,981
Ayumi-chan! Are you all right?!

834
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:24,850
Thank you, Mitsuhiko-kun!

835
01:01:24,874 --> 01:01:26,209
It was nothing!

836
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:32,515
M-Mitsuhiko-kun!

837
01:01:34,016 --> 01:01:38,431
Ayumi-chan, it appears we're out of the game.

838
01:01:38,455 --> 01:01:42,668
Conan-kun! Make sure you
bring us back to life, okay?!

839
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:44,694
Ayumi! Mitsuhiko!

840
01:01:56,373 --> 01:01:59,376
Not good! At this rate, we're
all going to get a "game over"!

841
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,623
"S.H."

842
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:06,316
Sherlock Holmes!

843
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:10,487
Conan! Look out!

844
01:02:12,655 --> 01:02:13,990
Genta!

845
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,738
Game over, huh...

846
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:24,267
Conan, make sure you
catch Jack the Ripper, okay?

847
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:34,653
Playtime is over!

848
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:38,157
I was going to capture you
and find out who you work for,

849
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:40,693
but that doesn't seem to be necessary anymore!

850
01:02:40,717 --> 01:02:43,061
Because this gun belongs to Holmes!

851
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:47,757
Damn! Now what?! What do we do?!

852
01:02:48,691 --> 01:02:51,704
The thing that man is holding... It's...

853
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:54,106
...the wine that was at that seat!

854
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,276
Now I see! That's what it was for!

855
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,636
Now, who goes first?

856
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,718
Boy!

857
01:03:05,742 --> 01:03:07,853
Shoot me and the wine bottle breaks!

858
01:03:07,877 --> 01:03:10,689
Hmph! What's that supposed to mean?!

859
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:14,059
The empty seat at the card table!

860
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,529
The specially-decorated chair,

861
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:20,266
and the glass and wine set
out for a certain visitor...

862
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,702
Using that as a hint,
I can deduce that said visitor

863
01:03:23,726 --> 01:03:27,906
can only be Professor Moriarty!

864
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,377
So sorry, but your deduction is wrong!

865
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:32,945
Then shoot!

866
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:36,482
If you don't care if the professor's
wine bottle shatters, that is.

867
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:37,840
B-Boy...

868
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:45,782
Conan-kun...

869
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:08,113
Moriarty-sama says he wishes to see you.

870
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:09,948
Professor Moriarty does?!

871
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:14,086
He waits in his carriage. Please follow me.

872
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,612
P-Please wait!

873
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,050
Do you intend to defy Moriarty-sama?

874
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:36,875
I have brought them, sir.

875
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:38,377
Well done.

876
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,514
Now then, boy. May I have that wine?

877
01:04:41,538 --> 01:04:42,872
Here.

878
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:46,743
This scent...

879
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:48,387
You are indeed Holmes' pupils,

880
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:52,190
if you're able to fight on
even terms with Colonel Moran.

881
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:55,193
So, you have business with me?

882
01:04:55,217 --> 01:04:58,797
Say, mister. You're Professor Moriarty?

883
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:00,366
None other.

884
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,803
Oh, I see. You're testing us.

885
01:05:04,827 --> 01:05:07,340
What do you mean?

886
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:11,844
You can drop the act!
You're not Professor Moriarty, mister!

887
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:14,880
W-What are you saying, Conan-kun?!

888
01:05:14,904 --> 01:05:18,575
After all, the real
Professor Moriarty is right here!

889
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,822
- Eh?! He is?!
- Are you serious?!

890
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:27,183
You used ventriloquism to
speak for him, didn't you?

891
01:05:30,853 --> 01:05:35,401
To think you saw through all
of that... How could you tell?

892
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:39,772
Just now, Colonel Moran said,
"Please wait!" to you.

893
01:05:39,796 --> 01:05:45,043
Oh, right! Colonel Moran only
speaks politely to Professor Moriarty!

894
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,745
Y-Yeah!

895
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:48,447
Is that all?

896
01:05:48,471 --> 01:05:53,452
One other thing. I heard Professor
Moriarty was a fanciful old man

897
01:05:53,476 --> 01:05:55,621
who uses natural herbal cologne!

898
01:05:55,645 --> 01:06:00,393
Oh? And you smelled that
when you gave him the wine?

899
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:04,421
Marvelously done. It's almost as
if I'm looking at a mini-Holmes.

900
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:10,102
Incidentally, what business
do you have with me?

901
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:13,105
You unleashed Jack the Ripper on the city

902
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:17,042
to change London into a town of terror, right?

903
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:19,545
That's not too far off the mark.

904
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:24,717
Jack the Ripper was a vagabond boy
I found in the poor part of town.

905
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:29,087
Abandoned by his mother,
he wandered the streets...

906
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:32,257
But I realized his talent the
moment I laid eyes on him.

907
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:34,951
His talent as a criminal, that is.

908
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:41,400
I raised him to be a
first-class professional killer.

909
01:06:41,424 --> 01:06:45,471
Why is he murdering innocent women?!

910
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:48,741
Jack the Ripper became
more of a homicidal maniac

911
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:50,909
than I had ever imagined.

912
01:06:50,933 --> 01:06:55,313
This string of murders is his own crazed doing.

913
01:06:55,337 --> 01:07:02,455
If you're trying to get rid of
Jack the Ripper, I'll lend you my help.

914
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:03,922
Help?!

915
01:07:03,946 --> 01:07:07,760
Jack the Ripper has indeed begun to run wild,

916
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:12,030
but he should still obey
my instructions to murder.

917
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:15,167
You simply need to beat him to his target.

918
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:16,702
How?!

919
01:07:16,726 --> 01:07:21,974
I will place a message for him in
the ads of tomorrow's Sunday Times.

920
01:07:21,998 --> 01:07:23,942
Who are you going to order him to kill?!

921
01:07:23,966 --> 01:07:26,636
You will find out in tomorrow's paper.

922
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:36,655
Hey! Can we trust this old man?!

923
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,681
Let's give it a shot.

924
01:07:39,982 --> 01:07:41,794
I pray for your luck.

925
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:44,987
Be careful at the Reichenbach
Falls three years from now!

926
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,550
What's "Reichenbach"?

927
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:07,553
Three years from now,
Professor Moriarty and Holmes fight

928
01:08:07,577 --> 01:08:11,223
at the Reichenbach waterfall in Switzerland.

929
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:13,759
They both fall to the bottom.

930
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:17,029
Holmes miraculously survives,

931
01:08:17,053 --> 01:08:20,365
but Professor Moriarty supposedly dies.

932
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:24,537
Why did I warn him like that?

933
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:28,898
I guess maybe I like that
villain as much as Holmes does!

934
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:34,737
That reminds me of that time...

935
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:39,251
I'm pretty fond of Professor Moriarty myself!

936
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:42,921
Well, as a fictional character, anyway.

937
01:08:42,945 --> 01:08:47,192
Their confrontation at
Holmes' house was mind-blowing!

938
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:51,429
I just love one of the things Holmes said then!

939
01:08:51,453 --> 01:08:53,198
Can you guess what it is?

940
01:08:53,222 --> 01:08:54,633
No.

941
01:08:54,657 --> 01:08:56,325
It was...

942
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:07,045
What did Shinichi say?

943
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:12,217
We were on a date, but he
kept talking about Holmes,

944
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:13,910
so I tuned him out...

945
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:17,322
Hey, Conan-kun.

946
01:09:17,346 --> 01:09:19,091
Yeah?

947
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:21,117
No. Never mind!

948
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:28,667
I'm so dumb. Of course Conan-kun wouldn't know.

949
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:31,637
H-Hey, Glasses.

950
01:09:31,661 --> 01:09:38,076
Sorry. It's our fault that four
people got a "game over..."

951
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,446
There's no point in worrying about what's done.

952
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:46,284
I'd say the fact you've started to
think that way is a good step forward.

953
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:51,313
Yes! Let's work hard to figure out
what to do next, for everyone!

954
01:10:07,864 --> 01:10:12,534
So this is where the second victim,
Honey Charleston, was found...

955
01:10:30,753 --> 01:10:32,731
"The parent-child bazaar will be held again

956
01:10:32,755 --> 01:10:35,467
on the second Saturday in October."

957
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:40,997
The second Saturday? As I recall,
Honey Charleston was killed...

958
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,201
...Saturday, September 8th!

959
01:10:52,074 --> 01:10:53,151
Sorry I made you wait!

960
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:55,921
What took so long? Where were you?!

961
01:10:55,945 --> 01:10:58,190
Just exploring the city!

962
01:10:58,214 --> 01:11:01,493
You sure are carefree on
the day of our showdown.

963
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:04,562
Jack the Ripper has struck again!

964
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:06,932
There were two victims this time!

965
01:11:06,956 --> 01:11:08,266
I'll take a paper!

966
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,902
Sure thing!

967
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:12,705
Oh no! I don't have English money!

968
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:15,207
Here you are! 80 yen!

969
01:11:15,231 --> 01:11:17,233
Oh. How convenient!

970
01:11:21,303 --> 01:11:22,715
Here it is!

971
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:28,353
"Clean the opera house tonight. From M to J."

972
01:11:28,377 --> 01:11:30,022
"From M to J..."

973
01:11:30,046 --> 01:11:32,524
"From Moriarty to Jack the Ripper."

974
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:36,094
Clean the opera house? Is that his instruction?

975
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:39,455
It could mean, "Murder an
actor who appears on stage..."

976
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,467
Here it is!

977
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:43,902
"The Triumphant Performance Returns!

978
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:47,773
Prima Donna in the Imperial
Opera of Warsaw... Irene Adler!"

979
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:52,244
Professor Moriarty!
You're the most despicable of villains!

980
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:55,113
Who's Irene Adler?

981
01:11:55,137 --> 01:11:59,217
It's said she's the only
woman Holmes ever loved!

982
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:02,745
Which means he made
Holmes' beloved the murder target.

983
01:12:12,755 --> 01:12:14,900
12:06 a.m.!

984
01:12:14,924 --> 01:12:18,236
- That means...
- ...all the other stages failed.

985
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,931
Which means everyone's
lives are in the hands of us six!

986
01:12:40,382 --> 01:12:41,659
Hold it!

987
01:12:41,683 --> 01:12:45,430
This area is for authorized persons only!

988
01:12:45,454 --> 01:12:49,267
W-We're acquaintances of Irene Adler-san!

989
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,103
We wanted to offer our
encouragement before she goes on!

990
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:53,605
Oh! You know her?

991
01:12:53,629 --> 01:12:56,174
Yes! Where is her waiting room?

992
01:12:56,198 --> 01:12:59,535
In that case, it's the room at
the very end, with the poster.

993
01:13:01,237 --> 01:13:05,851
This must be it. I wonder
what she's like. I'm so excited!

994
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:10,880
Given that my dad made her
character and that she's Holmes' love...

995
01:13:12,414 --> 01:13:13,749
Come in!

996
01:13:14,716 --> 01:13:16,385
Pardon the intrusion!

997
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:22,968
Shinichi's mom!

998
01:13:22,992 --> 01:13:24,536
I knew it.

999
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,206
How rude! I'm still single!

1000
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:32,410
Well, to be more precise,
I'm single now that I've divorced!

1001
01:13:32,434 --> 01:13:34,479
A bouquet from Holmes-san!

1002
01:13:34,503 --> 01:13:36,714
Oh! Thank you!

1003
01:13:36,738 --> 01:13:38,683
Where might Holmes-san be?

1004
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:41,419
He was looking forward
to tonight's performance,

1005
01:13:41,443 --> 01:13:43,856
but he had to leave on a case and can't come...

1006
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,324
Oh. That's too bad.

1007
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:48,326
Please call tonight's show off!

1008
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:49,494
Eh?

1009
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:52,097
Holmes-san's arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty,

1010
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:54,499
has sent someone to kill you!

1011
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:56,434
Why me?

1012
01:13:56,458 --> 01:14:01,339
Because he wants to see
Holmes-san's sadness when he loses you!

1013
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:07,379
I'd like to see it, too! I wonder
how sad he would be for me...

1014
01:14:07,403 --> 01:14:12,184
You don't care about being
Jack the Ripper's fifth victim?!

1015
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:16,212
You're going to protect me, right?
In Holmes-san's place?

1016
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,927
Nothing scares this lady...

1017
01:14:21,951 --> 01:14:25,287
Yeah. This is exactly how she is...

1018
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:55,584
Die beautifully, Irene Adler...

1019
01:14:58,754 --> 01:15:01,423
Where is he lurking?

1020
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,102
- What the-?!
- What's happening?!

1021
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:18,607
Look out!

1022
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,313
- Emori!
- Takizawa-kun!

1023
01:15:26,515 --> 01:15:30,528
- Emori! You're-!
- You too, Takizawa-kun!

1024
01:15:30,552 --> 01:15:32,197
Game over, huh...

1025
01:15:32,221 --> 01:15:34,499
This sucks...

1026
01:15:34,523 --> 01:15:37,193
Thank you. You saved my life!

1027
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:42,807
This is the first time
anyone's ever thanked me...

1028
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:45,210
I-It feels nice!

1029
01:15:45,234 --> 01:15:47,545
Moroboshi! I leave the rest to you now!

1030
01:15:47,569 --> 01:15:49,571
You can count on me!

1031
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:01,817
- A-Akira!
- Shinya!

1032
01:16:03,885 --> 01:16:07,556
That leaves only four,
including Ran-kun and Conan-kun...

1033
01:16:21,237 --> 01:16:26,742
That's it, Jack the Ripper!
Turn this world into Hell!

1034
01:16:31,247 --> 01:16:33,825
Hurry! Out the back!

1035
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:35,593
Hurry, Haibara! That way!

1036
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:37,619
Conan! Look out!

1037
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:46,504
Haibara! Are you okay?!

1038
01:16:46,528 --> 01:16:50,008
You can't give up, Kudo-kun!

1039
01:16:50,032 --> 01:16:55,580
If there aren't any assist characters,
then you're our Holmes...

1040
01:16:55,604 --> 01:16:58,616
You're skilled enough for that.

1041
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,644
There's no case Holmes can't solve, right?

1042
01:17:14,323 --> 01:17:15,324
Ai-kun...

1043
01:17:17,093 --> 01:17:19,428
Quickly! Quickly! Evacuate!

1044
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:25,334
Stay behind me!

1045
01:17:35,411 --> 01:17:38,590
- Stop!
- Bye! You're safe with police around!

1046
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:41,726
Little boy! I still don't know your name!

1047
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,895
I'm Edogawa Conan!

1048
01:17:43,919 --> 01:17:46,664
I have the same name as your guys' birth father!

1049
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:48,357
Conan?

1050
01:17:54,663 --> 01:17:56,665
I won't let him get away!

1051
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:00,245
How are things going?

1052
01:18:00,269 --> 01:18:03,581
Conan-kun's group encountered Jack the Ripper.

1053
01:18:03,605 --> 01:18:06,518
They're chasing him right now.

1054
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:08,544
Charing Cross Station!

1055
01:18:26,828 --> 01:18:28,830
Conan-kun! Get on first!

1056
01:18:33,635 --> 01:18:36,047
This is the worst possible scenario!

1057
01:18:36,071 --> 01:18:38,383
How so?

1058
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:41,853
The last train out of Charing Cross Station...

1059
01:18:41,877 --> 01:18:43,879
It's the most dangerous climax of all!

1060
01:19:00,196 --> 01:19:05,377
Eh?! Jack the Ripper is
disguised as a passenger?!

1061
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:07,812
Please gather all the
passengers onto a single car!

1062
01:19:07,836 --> 01:19:09,171
R-Right!

1063
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:19,448
Mr. Conductor! Could you...

1064
01:19:21,517 --> 01:19:24,496
Okay, everyone! Please raise both hands!

1065
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,190
I want to make sure no
one is carrying a weapon.

1066
01:19:35,096 --> 01:19:38,767
I look forward to hearing you figure this out...

1067
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:44,782
I'll now explain what was
written in Mr. Holmes' notes.

1068
01:19:44,806 --> 01:19:50,087
Honey Charleston, the second
victim of Jack the Ripper,

1069
01:19:50,111 --> 01:19:54,526
was married in the town of Windsor,
but as she was full of dreams,

1070
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:59,063
she abandoned her husband and son
10 years ago to come to London.

1071
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:03,768
These two rings were at the scene
of Honey Charleston's murder.

1072
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:05,237
One is Honey's.

1073
01:20:05,261 --> 01:20:10,475
The other has the same design,
but didn't fit any of Honey's fingers.

1074
01:20:10,499 --> 01:20:13,911
So Mr. Holmes believes the following.

1075
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:17,915
He thinks these two rings may
have signified the parent-child bond

1076
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:21,319
between the victim,
Honey Charleston, and Jack the Ripper.

1077
01:20:21,343 --> 01:20:25,290
Meaning that little ring is Jack the Ripper's?!

1078
01:20:25,314 --> 01:20:26,558
Yes.

1079
01:20:26,582 --> 01:20:30,728
She put a ring of the same design
on her son's finger before leaving.

1080
01:20:30,752 --> 01:20:34,932
Does that mean Jack the Ripper
murdered his own mother?

1081
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:38,936
Yeah. According to his notes,
the day she was murdered, Sept. 8,

1082
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,938
was the second Saturday of September,

1083
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:44,942
the day of the monthly bazaar
at the Whitechapel church,

1084
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:50,181
in which parents and children
bring things they made together!

1085
01:20:50,205 --> 01:20:53,651
And he thinks Jack the Ripper knew that!

1086
01:20:53,675 --> 01:20:57,121
Eh? He even wrote that down?

1087
01:20:57,145 --> 01:21:03,528
In other words, Jack the Ripper
wanted to participate with his mother,

1088
01:21:03,552 --> 01:21:05,763
so he left their two rings?

1089
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:08,433
Yeah! Apparently!

1090
01:21:08,457 --> 01:21:13,462
Then his motive was his grudge
for his mother abandoning him...

1091
01:21:14,796 --> 01:21:18,467
What did I do?! I'm not the only one drunk!

1092
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:26,475
But his bloodlust was almost out of love...

1093
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:31,356
How sad...

1094
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,892
Apparently, he chose an unrelated
woman for his first victim

1095
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,795
to throw the police off.

1096
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:41,132
But what about the third and fourth victims?

1097
01:21:41,156 --> 01:21:43,868
Professor Moriarty's special education

1098
01:21:43,892 --> 01:21:48,239
molded Jack the Ripper
into a psychotic criminal,

1099
01:21:48,263 --> 01:21:50,642
so even after clearing his
grudge with his mother,

1100
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:55,880
he couldn't help but continue
targeting women like her.

1101
01:21:55,904 --> 01:21:57,815
Who is it, then?!

1102
01:21:57,839 --> 01:22:02,820
If he kept the ring on since childhood,

1103
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:05,823
what do you think would happen to his finger?

1104
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:10,185
Out of his 10 fingers, that
one finger should be thin!

1105
01:22:13,855 --> 01:22:16,858
Jack the Ripper is you!

1106
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:21,963
But that's a woman!

1107
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:27,268
Her right ring finger is thin!

1108
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:37,613
- I got this!
- No! Ran-neechan!

1109
01:22:40,048 --> 01:22:41,693
Damn! A smokescreen!

1110
01:22:41,717 --> 01:22:43,719
- Open the window!
- Yeah!

1111
01:22:51,627 --> 01:22:52,937
T-They're gone!

1112
01:22:52,961 --> 01:22:54,630
H-Hey!

1113
01:22:57,065 --> 01:23:00,402
All the passengers have
disappeared! What's going on?!

1114
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:10,655
Now, then. Let us identify
who Kashimura's killer was, too.

1115
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:13,758
Eh?! You know who did it?!

1116
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:18,896
The issue is how the killer
prepared the murder weapon.

1117
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:24,335
A metal detector is installed at
the entrance to the Beika City Hall.

1118
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:31,108
So it's mostly likely that the weapon
was already inside the building.

1119
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:34,311
But where could someone get that?!

1120
01:23:34,335 --> 01:23:37,649
The bronze statues in the party hall.

1121
01:23:37,673 --> 01:23:40,341
One of them is holding a dagger.

1122
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:45,523
The party hall was filled with guests!

1123
01:23:45,547 --> 01:23:48,426
Someone would've seen the killer taking it!

1124
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:55,332
It was removed when the lights went out.
It had all been scheduled.

1125
01:23:55,356 --> 01:24:00,104
But wouldn't someone have
noticed the dagger was missing?!

1126
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:05,943
A fake was left in its place.
Made of cardboard and foil or something.

1127
01:24:05,967 --> 01:24:08,980
Then, is the dagger the statue's holding now

1128
01:24:09,004 --> 01:24:11,282
the one used in the murder?!

1129
01:24:11,306 --> 01:24:17,622
Yes. I just had a luminol test and
fingerprint check done on the dagger.

1130
01:24:17,646 --> 01:24:21,392
Blood the same type as Kashimura's was found.

1131
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:25,530
Fingerprints were also found on the handle.

1132
01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:30,968
Your fingerprints, President Schindler.

1133
01:24:30,992 --> 01:24:36,173
Of course they were. The bronze
statues were brought from my home.

1134
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:39,176
This is surveillance footage of the party hall

1135
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,547
from before and after the incident.

1136
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:47,151
Luckily, surveillance cameras
are placed all around the hall,

1137
01:24:47,175 --> 01:24:50,988
so I could record from every angle.

1138
01:24:51,012 --> 01:24:54,058
The ball that young Moroboshi
kicks hits the bronze statue

1139
01:24:54,082 --> 01:24:57,028
and knocks the dagger off.

1140
01:24:57,052 --> 01:25:01,533
He picks it up and returns
it to the statue's hand.

1141
01:25:01,557 --> 01:25:05,036
I see! If the dagger shown here is the real one,

1142
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:08,005
the boy's fingerprints should be on it too!

1143
01:25:08,029 --> 01:25:13,077
But only President Schindler's
fingerprints were found!

1144
01:25:13,101 --> 01:25:18,115
I simply touched it after the boy,
so his fingerprints are gone.

1145
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:21,185
Kudo-sensei! I found it!

1146
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:23,621
There was a fake dagger
made of cardboard and foil

1147
01:25:23,645 --> 01:25:25,122
in the basement garbage collection!

1148
01:25:25,146 --> 01:25:26,791
Any fingerprints?!

1149
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:29,026
It's just like you said, Kudo-sensei!

1150
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:35,066
It has young Moroboshi's and
President Schindler's fingerprints!

1151
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:40,037
The only fingerprints that can be
on the fake dagger besides the boy's

1152
01:25:40,061 --> 01:25:42,073
are the killer's.

1153
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:46,110
This is a set-up! I'm issuing a
protest to the Japanese government!

1154
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:49,470
Besides, I have no reason to
murder Kashimura in the first place!

1155
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:56,444
They're not here! All that's
up ahead is the engine room!

1156
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:05,663
The driver is gone!

1157
01:26:05,687 --> 01:26:08,023
- We gotta stop the train!
- Yeah!

1158
01:26:10,258 --> 01:26:12,260
The brake's been destroyed!

1159
01:26:21,637 --> 01:26:23,280
We're speeding up!

1160
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:26,818
Hey! Shouldn't we find that girl?!

1161
01:26:26,842 --> 01:26:30,121
Ran! Where are you?! Where did you go?!

1162
01:26:30,145 --> 01:26:31,813
Wait!

1163
01:26:33,348 --> 01:26:35,350
There they are!

1164
01:26:42,624 --> 01:26:44,168
Ran-neechan!

1165
01:26:44,192 --> 01:26:46,194
No! Stay away!

1166
01:26:48,163 --> 01:26:51,308
I've tied myself to this girl.

1167
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:55,112
If I fall, she comes with me!

1168
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:57,649
So, how will you fight?!

1169
01:26:57,673 --> 01:26:59,340
Dammit!

1170
01:27:00,475 --> 01:27:03,454
I hear the statue's dagger
has been passed down

1171
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:07,524
from generation to generation in
the same Schindler family bloodline.

1172
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:10,227
Indeed it has.

1173
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:14,398
Why did you use it as the murder weapon?

1174
01:27:14,422 --> 01:27:20,428
Assuming you didn't have to
use it as the murder weapon...

1175
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:27,344
What is it you want, Jack the Ripper?!

1176
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:29,146
"Want"?!

1177
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,349
Now that you've killed your mother
and cleared your long grudge,

1178
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,151
what is it you want?!

1179
01:27:34,175 --> 01:27:36,153
To continue living!

1180
01:27:36,177 --> 01:27:39,156
I'm going to let the vicious
blood flowing through my veins

1181
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,851
survive to the next
generation aboard Noah's boat!

1182
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:49,024
I take it this is your motive
for murdering Kashimura.

1183
01:27:51,226 --> 01:27:56,373
Almost as if he had been aboard
Noah's ark, Jack the Ripper's blood

1184
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:59,711
survived to the present day.

1185
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:03,547
You're Jack the Ripper's descendant.

1186
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:07,184
- J-Jack the Ripper's...
- ...descendant?!

1187
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:12,023
Hiroki-kun most likely learned
this using his DNA Search Program.

1188
01:28:12,047 --> 01:28:16,027
If the world learned that the czar
of the IT industry is the descendant

1189
01:28:16,051 --> 01:28:20,965
of the psychotic serial murderer
from 100 years ago, he'd be done for.

1190
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:24,869
So, to keep things quiet,
you drove Hiroki-kun to suicide...

1191
01:28:24,893 --> 01:28:28,873
...and murdered Kashimura!

1192
01:28:28,897 --> 01:28:33,902
It was when Hiroki came to see my collection.

1193
01:28:35,636 --> 01:28:40,384
This is a gold wine cup used
by the Egyptian king Khufu.

1194
01:28:40,408 --> 01:28:43,220
Next is Ganjin Wajo's scriptures

1195
01:28:43,244 --> 01:28:47,792
and the manuscript of Edogawa
Rampo's "The Psychological Test."

1196
01:28:47,816 --> 01:28:49,150
Amazing!

1197
01:28:50,986 --> 01:28:53,430
What about this dagger?

1198
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:56,768
Oh, uhh...

1199
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:59,771
It's supposedly the weapon
used by Jack the Ripper,

1200
01:28:59,795 --> 01:29:02,406
a deranged serial killer from a century ago...

1201
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,433
There's no telling if it really is, though.

1202
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:15,019
For an experiment, Hiroki gathered
all the data around him he could

1203
01:29:15,043 --> 01:29:17,654
and entered it into the computer.

1204
01:29:17,678 --> 01:29:21,959
And the DNA of Honey Charleston,
taken from the dagger,

1205
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:24,829
matched with yours.

1206
01:29:24,853 --> 01:29:26,964
You were afraid.

1207
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:29,967
Afraid that Hiroki-kun would eventually learn

1208
01:29:29,991 --> 01:29:32,369
that Jack the Ripper was Honey's son.

1209
01:29:32,393 --> 01:29:35,272
Afraid it was only a matter
of time until he learned

1210
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:38,442
you're Jack the Ripper's descendant!

1211
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:43,314
I was scared of the terrifying
blood that flows inside me!

1212
01:29:43,338 --> 01:29:47,451
Who cares about your
"murderer's blood" or the public eye?!

1213
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:50,145
Why didn't you try to fight it?!

1214
01:29:53,348 --> 01:29:56,693
Just as Conan-kun and his friends are now.

1215
01:29:56,717 --> 01:29:58,295
Thomas Schindler.

1216
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:01,322
You're under arrest for the
murder of Kashimura Tadaaki-san.

1217
01:30:14,335 --> 01:30:17,681
You'll never catch me if
you're always running away!

1218
01:30:17,705 --> 01:30:20,484
10 minutes until the final stop.

1219
01:30:20,508 --> 01:30:23,511
What do you think will happen
to this train, without its driver?

1220
01:30:29,684 --> 01:30:32,687
Though it seems you'll be long
dead before the next station.

1221
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:37,893
Conan-kun! Behind you!

1222
01:30:46,267 --> 01:30:48,603
End of the line, boy.

1223
01:30:49,804 --> 01:30:51,348
Conan-kun!

1224
01:30:51,372 --> 01:30:53,050
Let Glasses go!

1225
01:30:53,074 --> 01:30:54,742
Moroboshi-kun!

1226
01:30:56,377 --> 01:30:57,354
Are you all right?!

1227
01:30:57,378 --> 01:31:00,757
I-I think!

1228
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:03,784
Now then! Where shall I start carving from?

1229
01:31:06,988 --> 01:31:08,900
What do I do?!

1230
01:31:08,924 --> 01:31:12,260
Shinichi! What would you do in this situation?!

1231
01:31:13,561 --> 01:31:18,109
I just love one of the things Holmes said then!

1232
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:19,543
Can you guess what it is?

1233
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:21,378
No.

1234
01:31:21,402 --> 01:31:26,383
It was, "If you precise destruction,

1235
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:30,078
in the public interest,
I am willing to accept death."

1236
01:31:34,849 --> 01:31:36,560
Glasses!

1237
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:39,587
The Reichenbach Falls, Conan-kun!

1238
01:31:43,691 --> 01:31:45,436
Don't tell me you're...?!

1239
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,796
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you to the end.

1240
01:31:51,032 --> 01:31:52,809
Stop! Ran!

1241
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,502
Damn it!

1242
01:32:00,275 --> 01:32:01,943
Crap!

1243
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,483
Conan-kun, I believe in you.

1244
01:32:21,462 --> 01:32:23,464
Ran!

1245
01:32:27,368 --> 01:32:29,704
Glasses! We have to stop the train!

1246
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,352
Hey! We have to stop the
train so we can survive!

1247
01:32:35,376 --> 01:32:39,290
We still haven't won the game!

1248
01:32:39,314 --> 01:32:40,857
Get up, Glasses!

1249
01:32:40,881 --> 01:32:43,660
The lives of 48 people are in our hands!

1250
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,630
Are you just going to trample all over them?!

1251
01:32:46,654 --> 01:32:48,990
Don't be stupid! I don't wanna give up, either!

1252
01:32:51,726 --> 01:32:56,307
Think about it. The train
is continually speeding up.

1253
01:32:56,331 --> 01:32:58,575
It's moving at approximately 100 kph.

1254
01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:01,478
It'll reach the station in under five minutes.

1255
01:33:01,502 --> 01:33:03,314
The only way to save everyone

1256
01:33:03,338 --> 01:33:07,884
was to cut the links connecting the
engine car and the passenger cars!

1257
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:12,489
With just us two, those
links won't budge at all!

1258
01:33:12,513 --> 01:33:19,696
Yes. I was specifically counting
on Ran to help us with it...

1259
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,535
That's why Noah's Ark got
rid of all the passengers.

1260
01:33:24,559 --> 01:33:27,562
It's all over. There's nothing more we can do.

1261
01:33:30,531 --> 01:33:32,943
It's all over, Dad...

1262
01:33:32,967 --> 01:33:35,279
Hey, now! Don't give up!

1263
01:33:35,303 --> 01:33:40,517
You gotta survive and let Ran live again!

1264
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:41,876
Shinichi...

1265
01:33:49,384 --> 01:33:54,931
You still aren't covered in blood yet.
You're still alive.

1266
01:33:54,955 --> 01:33:56,967
Are you giving up already?

1267
01:33:56,991 --> 01:34:00,328
Just when you have both hands
on the string to unravel the truth?

1268
01:34:06,967 --> 01:34:08,945
The crimson red string of murder

1269
01:34:08,969 --> 01:34:13,150
has been mixed in the bundle
of colorless threads of life.

1270
01:34:13,174 --> 01:34:17,721
Isn't disentangling that what we do?

1271
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:19,414
Holmes!

1272
01:34:23,118 --> 01:34:26,997
Wasn't he in Dartmoor? Could it be a bug?

1273
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:28,832
What does he mean?

1274
01:34:28,856 --> 01:34:33,604
Jack the Ripper is dead, so why do
we have to get covered in blood?

1275
01:34:33,628 --> 01:34:36,173
This is it! This is what he meant!

1276
01:34:36,197 --> 01:34:37,408
The freight car!

1277
01:34:37,432 --> 01:34:39,343
Hey! Wait! What do you mean?!

1278
01:34:39,367 --> 01:34:41,369
Just come on!

1279
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:50,321
Use that axe to break the red wine barrels!

1280
01:34:50,345 --> 01:34:51,679
Hurry!

1281
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:10,798
- Dive under on my signal!
- Okay!

1282
01:35:24,645 --> 01:35:25,980
Now!

1283
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,192
Have they said anything?!

1284
01:36:01,216 --> 01:36:03,594
Still nothing!

1285
01:36:03,618 --> 01:36:07,121
Oh wonderful, merciful Conan-sama!
I beg of you to save Ran!

1286
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:21,678
I see. "Covered in blood."

1287
01:36:21,702 --> 01:36:27,017
It meant, "Use the red
wine to cushion the shock."

1288
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:31,588
Thanks for the help, Holmes. No... Dad.

1289
01:36:31,612 --> 01:36:36,727
You're awake, Glasses? It seems you win.

1290
01:36:36,751 --> 01:36:38,085
"You"?

1291
01:36:41,789 --> 01:36:43,791
So I was right.

1292
01:36:45,826 --> 01:36:49,940
I'm glad I trusted you. Thank you.

1293
01:36:49,964 --> 01:36:54,745
You're welcome... Noah's Ark.

1294
01:36:54,769 --> 01:36:58,382
Or should I call you Hiroki-kun?

1295
01:36:58,406 --> 01:37:02,743
You borrowed Moroboshi-kun's
data to join in the game too, right?

1296
01:37:07,315 --> 01:37:10,160
When did you realize it?

1297
01:37:10,184 --> 01:37:15,165
There's no need to worry. I've cut
communication with the real world.

1298
01:37:15,189 --> 01:37:19,970
The first thing that
seemed strange was Big Ben!

1299
01:37:19,994 --> 01:37:23,173
You noticed it before the clock hand moved.

1300
01:37:23,197 --> 01:37:28,745
You did that to tell us what
Big Ben's time indicated, right?

1301
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:30,747
Next was the soccer ball.

1302
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:34,785
You called it a filthy ball
and threw it behind you.

1303
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:36,587
A 100 year-old soccer ball

1304
01:37:36,611 --> 01:37:40,281
would've been very interesting
to any soccer-loving boy.

1305
01:37:42,817 --> 01:37:46,797
I'm guessing that
although you put us in danger,

1306
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:51,968
you had faith we would overcome it as a group.

1307
01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:56,673
You didn't need to kill the next
few generations to reset Japan.

1308
01:37:56,697 --> 01:38:00,677
You hoped that overcoming
obstacles, the game's in this case,

1309
01:38:00,701 --> 01:38:05,782
without our parents' help would
help us mature on our own, right?

1310
01:38:05,806 --> 01:38:07,818
You weren't able to be heartless!

1311
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:11,355
Holmes' appearance at the end is the proof.

1312
01:38:11,379 --> 01:38:15,716
You let the assist character
show up right at the climax!

1313
01:38:18,753 --> 01:38:22,833
I borrowed Moroboshi-kun's
body and snuck into the game

1314
01:38:22,857 --> 01:38:27,538
because I wanted to play
with friends at least once.

1315
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:32,643
I was always busy working, you see...

1316
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:39,916
I'm sorry for frightening you.
But I had so much fun!

1317
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:42,919
And, I was jealous of how you and your dad

1318
01:38:42,943 --> 01:38:48,859
can communicate with your
minds even if you're far apart!

1319
01:38:48,883 --> 01:38:55,499
Your dad avenged my dad's killer. Thank you!

1320
01:38:55,523 --> 01:38:59,570
It's time to say goodbye.

1321
01:38:59,594 --> 01:39:04,599
Your mind will continue to
live on in Noah's Ark, right?

1322
01:39:06,934 --> 01:39:09,413
As long as computers like me are alive,

1323
01:39:09,437 --> 01:39:13,049
grownups will use them for bad things.

1324
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:16,076
It was still too soon to
create an artificial brain...

1325
01:39:18,913 --> 01:39:22,759
Okay! Return to your world!

1326
01:39:22,783 --> 01:39:26,963
After you wake up, I want
everyone to at least know this:

1327
01:39:26,987 --> 01:39:31,325
Real life isn't easy, like it is in video games.

1328
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,570
I hope you see your father!

1329
01:39:45,973 --> 01:39:47,918
Goodbye...

1330
01:39:47,942 --> 01:39:49,610
...Kudo Shinichi.

1331
01:40:32,987 --> 01:40:34,965
Ran!

1332
01:40:34,989 --> 01:40:36,991
Looks like he did it!

1333
01:40:54,074 --> 01:40:56,953
- Thank goodness you're all right!
- That was fun!

1334
01:40:56,977 --> 01:40:58,979
- I worked hard!
- Good job!

1335
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:06,530
Conan-kun! Thanks for bringing us back to life!

1336
01:41:06,554 --> 01:41:08,799
We worked pretty hard, didn't we?!

1337
01:41:08,823 --> 01:41:10,825
That was an incredible adventure!

1338
01:41:13,193 --> 01:41:16,196
Reality really is much better...

1339
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:21,268
What happened?

1340
01:41:26,173 --> 01:41:29,085
I knew you'd be able to do it, Conan-kun!

1341
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:33,724
But, Ran-neechan! Jumping off
with him was way too crazy!

1342
01:41:33,748 --> 01:41:37,994
But I remembered one of
Shinichi's favorite Holmes quotes!

1343
01:41:38,018 --> 01:41:43,834
Eh? Was it when Holmes and
Prof. Moriarty met for the first time?

1344
01:41:43,858 --> 01:41:46,537
Huh? How do you know that?

1345
01:41:46,561 --> 01:41:50,674
No, uhh, I heard from Shinichi-niichan, too...

1346
01:41:50,698 --> 01:41:56,547
Oh! But all his blabbing
really proved useful for once!

1347
01:41:56,571 --> 01:42:00,350
Stop calling it "blabbing"!

1348
01:42:00,374 --> 01:42:03,186
- Ran!
- Dad!

1349
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:05,212
Thank goodness you're okay!

1350
01:42:25,132 --> 01:42:28,244
That took a bit long for you.

1351
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:30,605
Yeah. I quite enjoyed it.

1352
01:42:46,086 --> 01:42:51,067
Noah's Ark is ending his own life.

1353
01:42:51,091 --> 01:42:54,595
Rest in peace, Hiroki-kun.
