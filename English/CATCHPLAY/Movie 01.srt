1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,166
"Kurokawa Mansion"

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,810
As Mr. Kurokawa sat at his
word processor, having a drink,

3
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:25,876
"Kurokawa Daizo (62) - Kurokawa Hospital Director"
As Mr. Kurokawa sat at his word processor, having a drink,

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,810
"Kurokawa Daizo (62) - Kurokawa Hospital Director"
someone hit and killed him from behind.

5
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:29,477
someone hit and killed him from behind.

6
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:33,843
The weapon was undoubtedly
the bronze statue lying next to him.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,343
But this is what I don't understand.

8
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:41,000
While it appears to be a dying
message, what does "JUN" mean?

9
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,509
It identifies the culprit,
loud and clear.

10
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,943
Say what?!

11
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:50,166
What's more, the killer
is one of those three!

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,810
He's on the ball for once!

13
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:53,577
"Kurokawa Mina (32) -
Daizo's Second Wife"

14
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,910
"Kurokawa Mina (32) - Daizo's Second Wife"
His wife, Kurokawa Mina-san,

15
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,810
"Kurokawa Daisuke (36) - Eldest Son - Physician"
his oldest son, Kurokawa Daisuke-san,

16
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,055
"Nakazawa Manami (27) - Housekeeper"
and his housekeeper, Nakazawa Manami-san.

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,642
"Nakazawa Manami (27) - Housekeeper"
One of these is the killer.

18
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,543
Great, Mori-kun!
So, who is it?!

19
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,476
The person who killed Kurokawa Taizo is...

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
...you!

21
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,000
H-his wife?!

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,042
The letters "JUN" that
Mr. Kurokawa left behind

23
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:22,176
correspond to the English word
for the six month of the year: June.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,476
This month can also be called
"Minazuki" in Japanese.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,910
In other words, "Mina-san".
What's more, you-

26
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:34,242
So what if I was born in June?!
So what if "Mina" is in "Minazuki"?!

27
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:37,276
You're gonna pin this on me
with some lousy pun?!

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,042
No, no, this is a logical
deduction based on-

29
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:45,710
Would someone on the verge of death
do something so roundabout?

30
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,710
If it was me, I'd just type
the killer's name straight out.

31
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,176
Not you, too, Inspector?

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,810
That's the extent
of his logic? Oh well...

33
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,042
Is making innocent people out
to be guilty what detectives do?!

34
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,276
I'll do it like always and use
this Anesthetic Watch Gun

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,633
to have the old man sleep again!

36
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,776
Here it comes!

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,900
Really?! I've been waiting!

38
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:17,743
Yes. I was merely joking
when I said you were the killer.

39
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:18,943
Joking?

40
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:22,000
Inspector Megure.
Take a close look at the body.

41
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:28,242
Mr. Kurokawa's right pinky
is the only finger with blood on it.

42
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,543
Indeed it is.

43
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:33,676
So, which parts of the keyboard
have blood on them?

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,810
"Ke", "mu", "ro", and the uppercase
English key on the left side.

45
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:43,343
The blood on the "ke", "mu",
and "ro" keys came from his pinky

46
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:49,176
when Mr. Kurokawa typed
"JUN" with his index finger,

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,834
but no one presses keys on the very
left side with their right pinky.

48
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,810
Then where did the blood
on that left key come from?

49
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:05,643
Most likely, Mr. Kurokawa was hit
from behind by the stealthy culprit,

50
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,910
upon which he put
his right hand to his head.

51
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,676
This is probably where the blood
on his pinky came from.

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,443
Then, when he looked back,
he was hit again,

53
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:18,042
and he knocked over the keyboard
with his pinky as he fell.

54
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,443
In other words, the English
uppercase key on the very left

55
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,876
was not pressed of Mr. Kurokawa's
will at the time of the crime,

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,776
but just happened to be pressed
as he fell instead.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,576
Then, after the killer left,
Mr. Kurokawa used the last of his strength

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,934
to press the keys in front of him...

59
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,376
...thinking he was typing in Japanese kana.

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Then what would "JUN" have been in kana?!

61
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,910
"Manami"!

62
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:54,576
Yes. The housewife,
Nakazawa Manami-san...

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,476
You did it!

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,643
Y-you're joking, right, Detective?
There's no proof, after all...

65
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,376
Oh, but there is proof.

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,500
You removed your slippers
at the time of the crime, did you not?

67
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:13,643
Because the slippers would have
made noise on the wood flooring,

68
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:18,810
making it impossible for you to sneak up
on Mr. Kurokawa unnoticed.

69
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,834
Unbeknownst to you...

70
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:26,476
...you actually stepped in
some of the blood on the ground.

71
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,343
The inexplicably missing bit
of blood in Exhibit A proves this.

72
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:37,000
There should be blood on
the bottom of your white sock!

73
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:48,609
You also said in your statement
that you hadn't gotten near the body.

74
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:53,166
May I ask that we be allowed
to examine the blood on your foot?

75
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:59,000
Kurokawa killed my husband one year ago.

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,810
You mean the patient
my old man did heart surgery on?!

77
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,109
That's right!

78
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:10,443
I'm the wife of the patient who died
after he operated on him drunk!

79
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,676
The fact no one noticed the simple
changes to my hair and name

80
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,000
means the incident wasn't big enough
for any of you to remember it.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,009
I tried to get testimonies from
the hospital staff so I could accuse him,

82
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,976
but not a single person would help me!

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,667
They were all afraid of Kurokawa!

84
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,443
So you decided to avenge your husband...

85
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,643
Today was the anniversary of his death...

86
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,710
I regret nothing!

87
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,500
I managed to get revenge for him!

88
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:58,800
Let's go.

89
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,500
Wound up giving him
all the credit again...

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,834
"Detective Conan -
The Clockwork Skyscraper"

91
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:25,676
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,042
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

93
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,834
where I witnessed a suspicious deal
with a man dressed in black.

94
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,676
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

95
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,000
that I didn't notice a second man
sneak up from behind me!

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,910
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

97
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:49,810
...my body had shrunk!

98
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:53,609
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

99
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,242
putting all the people
around me in danger!

100
00:06:56,266 --> 00:07:00,009
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

101
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:04,142
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

102
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,910
To get information on the men,

103
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:09,476
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

104
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,309
But the old guy's such
a bonehead detective...

105
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,776
Unable to stand by and watch,
I took his place

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,500
and used my powers of deduction
to solve tough case after tough case.

107
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:25,409
As a result, the old man's now
a prominent and famous detective,

108
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,976
while I'm stuck doing
grade school all over again.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,543
I even wound up in a
"Junior Detective League"

110
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,667
with my classmates Ayumi,
Genta, and Mitsuhiko.

111
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:41,710
Now let me introduce the gadgets
the doctor has built for me!

112
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:44,042
First is the Anesthetic Watch Gun!

113
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,943
Pressing the button while using
the aiming device on the cover

114
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,443
will launch an anesthetic needle
that can knock a person out instantly.

115
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:54,242
Next is the Voice-Altering Bow Tie!

116
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,476
By adjusting the dials on the back,

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,142
I can produce all types of voices,
from children to adult!

118
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,142
For offensive items,
I have the Power Kick Shoes!

119
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,376
They use electricity and magnetic fields

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,776
to stimulate my feet muscles
and maximize my kick power!

121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,033
To chase down criminals,
I have the Turbo-Engine Skateboard!

122
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:19,810
But as it's solar-powered, it can
only be used when the sun is out.

123
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,576
Whoops, can't forget this one!

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,476
The Junior Detective League's badges
contain miniature transceivers

125
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
as well as transmitters!

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,976
There are plenty of others,

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,376
but my main weapon
is undoubtedly this!

128
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,076
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

129
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,333
There is always only one truth!

130
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,643
"Dr. Agasa's House -
April 28th (Saturday)"

131
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:48,142
"To Kudo Yusaku..."
"To Mr. Yusaku Kudo..."

132
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,810
"Edogawa Conan (Kudo Shinichi)"
They're all to Dad...

133
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:51,811
"Edogawa Conan (Kudo Shinichi)"
Probably all fan letters anyway...

134
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,443
Probably all fan letters anyway...

135
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,943
Come to think of it, I hear
your father's latest Night Baron book

136
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,776
was a huge best seller
in America, too!

137
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,676
Yeah. But he's
in Switzerland now.

138
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,209
It's gotta be a pain
sending him fan letters

139
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:10,910
when he's constantly
traveling all over the world.

140
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,743
Well, the important thing is that
he's getting to do what he wants.

141
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,209
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,976
Incidentally Doc,
what're you making?

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,843
A new gadget for me?

144
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,943
Sorry, but it's nothing that paltry.

145
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,376
Humankind studied the birds
in the sky to create airplanes!

146
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,276
But no one has yet duplicated
the wing-flapping mechanism of insects!

147
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,676
If I can create the very first one
and sell it as a toy,

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,676
I'll capture the interest
of children the world over!

149
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,667
And then I'll get oodles of money
and become a billionaire!

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,042
And just when is that gonna be reality?

151
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:56,810
I've been hearing him
say that since I was a kid...

152
00:09:56,834 --> 00:10:00,976
Still, the fact I never get
fan letters anymore must mean

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,609
that society has completely forgotten-

154
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:04,577
"To Kudo Shinichi"

155
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,242
"To Kudo Shinichi"
It's to me.

156
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,033
"Moriya Teiji"?

157
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,976
The Moriya Teiji?

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,609
"Please forgive the
suddenness of my letter."

159
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,509
"I've heard much about your exploits
as a high school detective

160
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,343
in the newspapers and on television,

161
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:27,309
and very much wanted the chance
to speak with you in person."

162
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,209
"Agasa Hiroshi (52) - Inventor" As such, I would like
to invite you to the afternoon tea garden party

163
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:31,811
"As such, I would like to invite you
to the afternoon tea garden party

164
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:38,710
I am holding at my home on
Tuesday, April 29, at 3:30 pm."

165
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:41,333
"I do hope that you will attend."

166
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,276
Oh, so it's a party invitation?

167
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,142
Doc. You know who
Moriya Teiji is, right?

168
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,910
I most certainly do!

169
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,242
He's an architecture professor at Toto U.

170
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,843
and one of the best
architects in all of Japan!

171
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:58,576
Why would such a big shot
want to invite me?

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,476
Architecture is art, so he's probably
always looking for inspiration.

173
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,767
Plus, Professor Moriya
is a master genius just like me!

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,333
Master genius, indeed...

175
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,810
A garden party?

176
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,162
"Mori Ran - Teitan High School Junior"
Yeah. I can't make it, seeing as

177
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,809
"Mori Ran - Teitan High School Junior"
I'm in the middle of this one case...

178
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,042
"Mori Ran - Teitan High School Junior"
So you want me to go in your place?

179
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:29,242
The invitation said
companions are welcome too,

180
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,142
so you should go with your dad
and that one kid living with you-

181
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,443
- What's his name again?
- Conan-kun?

182
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:40,109
Yeah. You three should go.
The invitation's in your mailbox now.

183
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,376
Urgh! You hardly ever call,
and when you do, it's for selfish reasons!

184
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,509
Okay! But on one condition!

185
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,576
Condition?

186
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,276
See an all-night movie
with me next Saturday!

187
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,476
Eh?!

188
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,109
Come on! I haven't seen you in a while!

189
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,142
Meet me in the lobby
of the Beika Cinema at 10:00 pm!

190
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,476
W-wait! Next Saturday's no good!
Maybe later on when-

191
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,734
No! We have to go during May!

192
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,810
Say, which do you
like better, red or blue?

193
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,776
Red or blue?
What brought that on?

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,776
Just answer!

195
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,309
Well, red, I guess?

196
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,476
Red? I should've guessed!
That's what I was going to say, too!

197
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,443
Well, red is your favorite color...

198
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,043
"Mori Kogoro - Private Detective"

199
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,009
"Mori Kogoro - Private Detective"
Hey, where's dinner?

200
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:28,911
"Mori Kogoro - Private Detective"
Yes, yes, I'll get right on it.

201
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,376
Yes, yes, I'll get right on it.

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,834
Alright, Shinichi! The night of the 3rd,
at 10:00! Don't forget now!

203
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,376
Wait!

204
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,377
Geez.

205
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:42,033
If I could see a movie, I wouldn't
have said I couldn't make a party.

206
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:48,109
Still, why does it have to be May 3rd?

207
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,576
Did something happen on that day?

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,776
May 4th is when Holmes and Moriarty
fell into the Reichenbach Falls,

209
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,676
and May 5th is Children's Day...

210
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,509
Hey, Conan-kun!

211
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,810
- On your way home?
- Inspector! On another case?!

212
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,843
"Inspector Megure - Police HQ - Investigation Division"
Yes, on a couple...

213
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,743
"Inspector Megure - Police HQ - Investigation Division"
Oh, let me introduce you.

214
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,343
Oh, let me introduce you.
This is my newest assistant, Shiratori-kun.

215
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:16,543
"Shiratori Keiji - Police HQ - Investigation Division"
My name's Shiratori. The inspector's told me about you.

216
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,376
I hear you notice interesting things...

217
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
No, it's all just coincidence!

218
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:27,166
Yes. Multiple coincidences are common...

219
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,476
Well, I'll be!

220
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,142
With all these incidents,
I won't get to relax during Golden Week.

221
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,500
Bye!

222
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,710
Golden Week?

223
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,333
Oh, yeah!

224
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:45,242
May 3rd is Constitution Memorial Day!

225
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,643
And that's gotta do with what?

226
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,376
Birthday?

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,176
That's right!
May 4th is Shinichi's birthday!

228
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,109
My plan is to invite him
to an all-night movie on May 3rd,

229
00:13:56,133 --> 00:14:00,343
and then surprise him by handing him
a red polo shirt for a present

230
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,343
when the clock strikes midnight!

231
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,810
Oh, yeah!
May 4th is my birthday!

232
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,443
I totally forgot...

233
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:10,343
So what movie are you seein'?

234
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,876
"Legend of the Red Thread".

235
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,409
Red thread?

236
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,142
Oh, you never heard of it?

237
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,443
It's a romantic movie based on a story
about a man and a woman

238
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:24,609
whose pinkies were connected
by a red thread of destiny since birth!

239
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,910
Ick! That's so girly...

240
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:31,776
And look! Both Shinichi and I
have red as our lucky color for May!

241
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,576
So I decided that we gotta see this!

242
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,000
That's nice, but there's
no way I can see it with you...

243
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,643
Hold on! Didn't you say
this was an all-night movie?!

244
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,676
That's right...

245
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,142
Forget it! I forbid it!

246
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,676
A young man and woman getting
all cozy in the dark, late at night-

247
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,242
It's not like that!
Don't be creepy!

248
00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:00,142
Shinichi always forgets his birthday!

249
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,242
I have to remind him every year!

250
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,834
Otherwise he'd just get older and older!

251
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,009
Though I'm actually smaller now...

252
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,042
Yeah, but... He's still in high school-

253
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,543
Oh, yeah!

254
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:18,109
Dad! Let's go to Moriya
Teiji's garden party!

255
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,476
W-what brought that on?

256
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,676
Shinichi was actually the one invited,
but he can't make it...

257
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,476
- Wanna come too, Conan-kun?
- Yeah! I do!

258
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,142
Like we can really go,
using an invitation for Shinichi!

259
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,476
Moriya Teiji is a famous architect, right?

260
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,200
It'd be a historical meeting between
great detective and great architect!

261
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:43,834
Great detective and great architect, huh?!

262
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,667
He is so easy to manipulate...

263
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:52,834
"Moriya Mansion - April 29th (Tuesday)"

264
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,066
Conan-kun! Wait!
We need the invitation!

265
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,533
- Enjoy yourselves!
- Thanks!

266
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,375
Wow!

267
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,566
Truly a building from 17th century
England's House of Stewart era!

268
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,709
You know a lot about architecture, Dad!

269
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,375
Yes, I was once known
as the Walking Library!

270
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,432
More importantly, look closely
at the left and right sides.

271
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,710
Hey, look!

272
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:39,508
When you stand in the middle,
the left and right sides look the same!

273
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,709
The garden and the building!

274
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:46,042
This is what they call "symmetry"!

275
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,775
Professor Moriya lived
in England until high school,

276
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,176
so he is quite fond of English-style
architecture. In particular-

277
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,076
In particular, uhh...

278
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,076
His keenness for classical-style
symmetry is remarkable!

279
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,976
A cheat sheet...

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,408
He even changed how he writes
"Teiji" to give his name symmetry!

281
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,775
Almost sounds like a disease...

282
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,142
This is the first time I've seen
such a wonderful garden!

283
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:15,910
I thank you for your kind praise!

284
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,775
"Moriya Teiji (47) - Architect"
I thank you for your kind praise!

285
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,642
"Moriya Teiji (47) - Architect"
Hello, I am Moriya Teiji.

286
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:24,042
I- I'm Mori Ran! This is my father,
and Edogawa Conan-kun.

287
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:28,042
Shinichi-I mean, Kudo-kun-
couldn't make it today,

288
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,766
so we came in his place!

289
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,842
I see. So Kudo-kun couldn't come...

290
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:38,408
But this man's a famous detective, too!

291
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,100
Hey! Whadya mean, "too"?!

292
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,408
I'm Mori Kogoro.

293
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,432
Oh! You're that famous detective!
Pleasure to meet you!

294
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:56,666
Right this way.
The party is in the rear garden.

295
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,875
The rear garden is just as wonderful!

296
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:03,742
Just what I'd expect
from a famous architect's party;

297
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:09,542
musicians, models, corporate execs,
critics, and celebrities...

298
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:13,009
All famous people from TV...

299
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:16,699
Please, make yourselves
at home this afternoon!

300
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,775
How pretty! Are these all homemade?

301
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,176
But of course. It's only proper
to serve homemade food at a tea party.

302
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,842
Please, have some.

303
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,133
Thank you!

304
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:34,209
How does it taste?

305
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,176
These cookies are delicious!

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,375
I'm glad to hear it!

307
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:41,742
Spending all night
making them was worth it!

308
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,076
Oh, Professor!
You cook?!

309
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,709
I might not look it,
but I am single.

310
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:53,742
All the food here-the scones,
sandwiches, cookies-I made it all.

311
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,176
I'm the type who isn't satisfied
unless I do everything myself...

312
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,709
I see! That's the mentality that produces
all those beautiful buildings?

313
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:06,875
I do not consider something
architecture if it is not beautiful!

314
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,709
Most young architects these days
lack artistic sense!

315
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,733
They need to feel much more
responsibility for their works!

316
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:21,242
Incidentally, Mori-san.
Would you mind if I posed a quiz?

317
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,976
A quiz?

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,575
Yes. The goal is to deduce
the password to a computer

319
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,408
that three men use
for their business,

320
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:34,909
though I'm sure it will take the great
Mori Kogoro-san no time at all.

321
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:37,742
- He's the famous Mori Kogoro-san!
- This'll be great!

322
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:39,375
Certainly!

323
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,376
Go ahead!

324
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,176
Hey, now. You gonna be alright?

325
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,709
Well, then, here is the data
on those three people.

326
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:50,542
The password is a five-character word
based on their commonalities.

327
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,599
Would you like to try too, Ran-san?

328
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,066
You have three minutes to solve it.
Please think it over, everyone.

329
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:07,033
Ready, begin!

330
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,742
Their names have no common characters...

331
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:16,609
Their birthdates and blood types
are all different, as are their hobbies.

332
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,200
This is harder than I thought...

333
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,266
What could it be? Do you suppose
they have something in common?

334
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,909
I give up. I think I'll wait
for the pro's answer.

335
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,266
Same here...

336
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:52,066
Do you think Dad'll be all right?

337
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,666
Wait, these three people
were each born a year apart...

338
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,775
I got it!

339
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,408
It's "Momotaro"!
(famous folk tale hero)

340
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:06,308
M- Momotaro?!

341
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,542
It's their Chinese zodiac signs!

342
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,308
The years of the monkey,
the rooster, and the dog...

343
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:15,933
A monkey, a bird, and a dog
were all Momotaro's retainers!

344
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,432
Correct, little boy!
Most impressive!

345
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,833
Gotta have embarrassments
sometimes too, old man!

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,042
Seeing as you've solved the puzzle,

347
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:34,375
I'll give you a special tour
of my gallery, Conan-kun!

348
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,909
You may come too, Ran-san!

349
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:36,933
Okay!

350
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,933
Please feel free to look around!

351
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,766
Huh? Ran-neechan!
Isn't this that one house?

352
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,742
Oh, it is!

353
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,442
It's Kurokawa-san's mansion!

354
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:03,976
Speaking of which,
wasn't Kurokawa-san murdered?

355
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,308
Yes...

356
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:09,508
I designed this house very shortly
after I struck out on my own.

357
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:13,266
Everything beyond it is from my 30s.

358
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:19,133
I was still inept in my youth.
Please don't pay them much attention...

359
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:22,176
He's even designed a bridge...

360
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,408
Incidentally, Ran-san.
Are you and Kudo-kun very close?

361
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,042
Yes, I suppose!

362
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:31,375
We grew up together,
and we go to the same high school!

363
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,933
Though I haven't seen him
at all recently...

364
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,742
But this Sunday, Shinichi-

365
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:42,742
No, he and I have a date
to see a movie on his birthday!

366
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,642
Oh, that sounds like fun!

367
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,308
I take it you've already
gotten him a present?

368
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,675
No, on Saturday
I'm going to-

369
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:54,209
He and I both like
the color red!

370
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:57,609
And we both have red
as our lucky color for May!

371
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:00,966
So I was thinking of giving
him a red polo shirt!

372
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:06,475
That sounds like a marvelous present!
I'm sure Kudo-kun will love it!

373
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,642
Thanks!

374
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:12,042
Crap! I haven't figured out
what to do on my birthday!

375
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:15,909
Oh? Isn't this the Beika City Building?

376
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,675
That's right.

377
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:21,009
We're seeing the movie
in this building, in Beika Cinema 1!

378
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,642
We're meeting in the lobby
at 10:00 on the night of the 3rd!

379
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:28,209
Is that so? This building
is one of my best works...

380
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:33,842
There's no better place for a young
couple to celebrate a birthday at!

381
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:36,399
W-what am I gonna do?

382
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,076
"May 3rd (Saturday)"

383
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,009
Well, order something for dinner, okay?

384
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,442
Okay...

385
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,976
Ten hours until 10:00 at night...

386
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,666
I am so screwed...

387
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,642
See you later!

388
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,342
What am I hiding for?

389
00:23:57,366 --> 00:24:00,442
I told you to turn her down earlier!

390
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,176
I couldn't help it!

391
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,609
I couldn't turn Ran down
after seeing her check her calendar

392
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:08,176
so happily everyday!

393
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,342
Doc, build me a fancy Shinichi robot!

394
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,442
I'm afraid that's not possible,
even for a genius like me!

395
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,076
Didn't think so...

396
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,642
Two days ago,
a large amount of explosives,

397
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,976
containing octogen, was stolen
from a Toyo Munitions warehouse.

398
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,209
The police have mobilized over
100 officers for the investigation,

399
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,109
but no clues have been found yet.

400
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,942
Talk about scary...

401
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:36,642
Yeah. Octogen molded together
with plastic makes plastic explosives.

402
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:41,242
-Kurokawa mansion burned down,
including several nearby houses.

403
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,642
That's the Kurokawa house
from the other day!

404
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,442
Yes, where that murder took place...

405
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:49,342
There sure have been
a lot of arsons lately...

406
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:54,266
-the police believe the same person
is responsible for this fire-

407
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,609
Yes, hello?

408
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,609
Is Kudo Shinichi there?

409
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,642
Just a minute.

410
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,542
It's for you, Shinichi.

411
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,275
How do they know I'm here?!

412
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:12,599
Don't be silly! You know all calls
to your house get routed here now!

413
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:15,775
Oh, right! My bad...

414
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,508
But I never get calls anymore,
so I completely forgot.

415
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:24,966
He sounds odd, as if he's using
a voice changer too!

416
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,942
Hello?

417
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,009
- Kudo Shinichi?
- Yes.

418
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:33,042
You catch the news? I stole
the explosives from Toyo Munitions!

419
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,442
What?!

420
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,275
Think you could give me
your cell phone number?

421
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,976
I have no obligation to give it to you!

422
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,666
Oh, so you don't care if your
only contact with me gets cut?

423
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:49,266
Alright. The number is-

424
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:57,575
Alright. Now take your phone and come
to Green Park on the Teimuzu River.

425
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,209
I have something interesting to show you!

426
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,508
Green Park?!

427
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:03,408
Better hurry before some kids die!

428
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:04,432
What?!

429
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,509
Shinichi!

430
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,042
I gotta check it out!

431
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,675
You sure it's not just a prank call?

432
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:13,109
Using a voice changer
is too much to be a prank!

433
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:15,009
Contact Inspector Megure, Doc!

434
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,609
Right! Be careful, now!

435
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,766
Yeah, yeah!

436
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,866
"Teimuzu River Green Park"

437
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:49,309
"Ayumi" "Genta" "Mitsuhiko"

438
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,508
"Ayumi" "Genta" "Mitsuhiko"
C'mon, Mitsuhiko! Lemme fly it now!

439
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:52,842
"Ayumi" "Genta" "Mitsuhiko"
I want to try, too!

440
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,742
Hold on a minute.

441
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:58,275
Piloting a remote-control
plane is quite tough...

442
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,176
Hey, Mitsuhiko!
Where'd you get that plane?!

443
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,143
Conan-kun!

444
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,642
A man with a beard gave it to us!

445
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,308
He said it was a bomber plane!

446
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:09,209
A bomber plane?!

447
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,209
That thing beneath its fuselage...

448
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:13,442
...could it be a bomb?!

449
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:17,508
- Gimme that, Mitsuhiko!
- What?! It's my turn next!

450
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,266
There's a bomb on that plane!

451
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,308
You idiots!

452
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,575
Oh no!

453
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,042
The antenna broke off!

454
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,599
Conan-kun! The plane!

455
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,766
It's no use!
Everyone, run!

456
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,799
You idiots!
Not that way!

457
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,775
Conan! Do something!

458
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,766
Damn it!

459
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,933
Not good!

460
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,266
Go!

461
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,508
- What blew up?
- Fireworks?

462
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,266
It was a plane!

463
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:07,000
An orange flash!
Plastic explosives!

464
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:13,709
What's the big idea?!

465
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,042
Where's Kudo?

466
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,142
Crap!

467
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:20,842
Ah, so he's saying a brat like you
is enough to handle me...

468
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,176
"Like you"?

469
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Is he watching me from somewhere?!

470
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,408
Alright, listen up!

471
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:31,508
In exactly one hour,
another bomb will explode!

472
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:33,475
Exactly one hour?!

473
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:35,742
In the plaza in front of Beika Station!

474
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:39,076
If Kudo won't come, then you find it!

475
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,976
Wait! I'm just a kid;
I can't find it that easy!

476
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,599
Gimme a hint or something!

477
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,842
Hello?

478
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:50,742
Beneath a tree. But it's
not exactly buried beneath one.

479
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:54,466
You better hurry, or someone
might wind up taking it!

480
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,408
Damn it!

481
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,442
Conan-kun!

482
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,866
Hey, Conan!
Where are you going?!

483
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,699
Ten to 1:00!

484
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,266
No luck!
Can't find anything!

485
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:43,699
Welcome!

486
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:51,742
What does "under a tree" mean?!

487
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:54,000
And what does he mean
that someone'll take it?!

488
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:02,233
"Please, someone take her."

489
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:08,542
Did someone abandon you?
You poor thing...

490
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:12,499
Don't worry!
I'll take care of you!

491
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:18,642
Roots (nekko) are beneath a tree...

492
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,766
A cat (neko)?!

493
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,375
Thank you!

494
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,266
Huh?

495
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:30,399
Wait, old lady!

496
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,076
You idiot!
Can't you see the stoplight?!

497
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,432
S-sorry!

498
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,942
Oh no!

499
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:41,408
Five minutes to 1:00!

500
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:42,432
Dammit!

501
00:30:58,332 --> 00:31:00,100
Four minutes to 1:00!

502
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:06,442
Alright! She's caught in traffic!

503
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,976
What's going on?!
The sun is still high up...

504
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,100
Oh, yeah! It must've broken
somewhere when it went flying!

505
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,742
I'm borrowin' your bike, kid!

506
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:22,599
Wait!

507
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:27,699
Huh? "Kid"?
I'm younger than him?!

508
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,542
Oh no! It's starting to move!

509
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,042
Three minutes to 1:00!

510
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:39,066
Hey, yeah! This road
makes a big curve to the left!

511
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,408
A-are you alright, kid?!

512
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,100
Gimme this case, old lady!

513
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:00,742
25 seconds left!

514
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:02,508
Hey, kid! Are you alright?!

515
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:03,409
Yeah...

516
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,442
Damn!

517
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,266
I can't let it detonate here!
What do I do?!

518
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,133
It stopped?! Alright!

519
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,599
I'm pretty sure there's
an empty lot past the freeway!

520
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,933
You don't need this?

521
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,432
It's ticking again!

522
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,308
"Suzuki Sonoko - Teitan High School Junior"
Yeah, this is the one!

523
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,009
"Suzuki Sonoko - Teitan High School Junior"
-Ooh, how flashy! -But this color is-

524
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:05,776
- Ooh, how flashy!
- But this color is-

525
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,575
After being injured trying to distance
the device from people's homes,

526
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,266
the boy was rushed to the police hospital,
where he is being treated.

527
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:34,109
Conan-kun! You're awake!

528
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,166
Conan! You okay?!

529
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,941
- Where am I?
- The hospital!

530
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,608
Conan! What the hell were you doing?!

531
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,208
- Now, now...
- Explain so I can understand!

532
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,674
Your questions can wait!
Go get the doctor!

533
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:50,366
- Conan!
- I'll get him!

534
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:00,209
Right.

535
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,041
Nothing to worry about now.

536
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:06,308
His brain waves were just fine
when we checked earlier,

537
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:08,541
so he can probably leave tomorrow.

538
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,199
Thank you...

539
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:14,532
- Take care.
- Take care of yourself.

540
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:21,342
Sorry to be sudden, Conan-kun,
but can you tell us what happened?!

541
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:22,532
Yeah!

542
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,008
I see...

543
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:32,208
So you rode the bike to protect
others from the explosion?

544
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:33,042
Yeah...

545
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:35,175
Oh, Inspector!

546
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,208
The culprit makes contact by calling
Shinichi-niichan's cell phone!

547
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:43,208
But you can't use
cell phones in hospitals...

548
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:45,108
Oh, there's no need to worry.

549
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:48,141
We're isolated from that ward there,

550
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:51,442
and there are no electronic
medical devices here,

551
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:55,208
so cell phones can be used here!

552
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:59,541
Dr. Agasa explained the situation,
which is why we brought you here!

553
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,875
That's a relief...

554
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:04,375
Also, I ruined that bicycle...

555
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:07,108
Could you pay for it later, mister?

556
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:11,275
Never mind that-why did you
do something so reckless?!

557
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:13,975
You nearly died, you know!

558
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,175
Sorry...

559
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,141
Anyways, where is Shinichi?!
The guy's trying to call him, right?!

560
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,774
As I said, Shinichi-kun
is busy with something else,

561
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:26,508
so he asked Conan-kun to handle this...

562
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:31,008
What a lowlife! I'll teach him
a lesson next time I see him!

563
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:34,532
Definitely can't tell him
I'm Kudo Shinichi...

564
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:39,442
Anyway, Inspector! Did you find out
what kind of bombs they were?!

565
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,443
Yes.

566
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:46,332
Both the plane and the carrying case
bombs used plastic explosives.

567
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:48,366
Just as I thought...

568
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:58,965
A blue-tinged, orange flash is the
telltale sign of a plastic explosive!

569
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:04,442
They were most likely explosives
stolen from Toyo Munitions.

570
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:09,208
The plane had a concussion bomb
with a detonator cap attached,

571
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:14,741
while the carrying case had a
time bomb connected to a timer.

572
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:20,308
But the fact it temporarily stopped
16 seconds before 1:00 bugs me...

573
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:22,242
About that...

574
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:26,041
The only possibilities are that
the timer stopped due to a malfunction,

575
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:33,841
or that the culprit stopped it
remotely for whatever reason...

576
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:37,475
From the fact that the culprit
went out of his way to phone Kudo-kun,

577
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:42,774
he either wanted to challenge
the famous high school detective,

578
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:46,342
or he's someone with
a personal grudge against him.

579
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,242
From what I've looked into,

580
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,242
all the criminals from cases
solved by Kudo Shinichi-kun

581
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:54,208
are currently serving out
their prison sentences.

582
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:57,242
Meaning it must be
a relative or lover...

583
00:36:57,266 --> 00:37:03,008
In any case, we're out looking
for the man from the sketch they drew.

584
00:37:03,032 --> 00:37:05,574
He means this, Conan!
It looks just like him!

585
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,665
- It's a work of art!
- We all drew it together!

586
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,308
You really got his main features!

587
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,941
But it doesn't ring any bells...

588
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,598
He used a voice changer
to alter his voice!

589
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:23,342
It could be someone I know!

590
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,308
Inspector. Out of all
of Shinichi-kun's cases so far,

591
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:31,065
which one received
the most public attention?

592
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:39,665
That'd be the one involving
Mayor Okamoto of West Tama City...

593
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:44,475
A 25 year old female office worker
living in West Tama City died

594
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:49,199
when she was hit by a car
the mayor's son was driving.

595
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,175
The mayor had been
in the passenger seat

596
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,641
during what at first seemed
to be a regular accident...

597
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,099
"Kudo Shinichi - Teitan High School Junior"
...but Kudo-kun was skeptical about it.

598
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,266
"Okamoto Shicho (52) - West Tama City Mayor"
"Okamoto Kohei (21) - Shicho's Son"

599
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:34,641
This cigarette butt was found
lying directly next to the victim.

600
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:37,141
The son's saliva was found on it.

601
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:40,375
- So you tossed this away?
- Y-yes.

602
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:44,774
After I hit her, I rushed out of
the driver's seat and over to her.

603
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:47,865
I probably unconsciously
threw it away then.

604
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:51,774
I see.

605
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:56,375
Judging from its length,
it hadn't been lit for very long at all.

606
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,875
Yes, it happened just after I lit it.

607
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,641
- With a lighter?
- Yes.

608
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:03,208
What lighter did you use?

609
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,032
The car's cigarette lighter.

610
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:10,698
Then please get in the driver's seat
and try lighting a cigarette!

611
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,532
You need only go through the actions.

612
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:23,774
But... with your seatbelt on, please.

613
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:24,798
Okay.

614
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,375
Here...

615
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:32,008
Use one of these.

616
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:35,375
They're the same kind
as the one found at the scene.

617
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,598
Alright...

618
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:47,208
Stop!

619
00:39:47,232 --> 00:39:48,109
Yes...

620
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:53,442
The only way to reach it from
the driver's seat is with your left hand.

621
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:58,975
But that lighter only had fingerprints
from your right hand on it.

622
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,908
How do you explain that, Kohei-san?

623
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,008
I must've used my own lighter to-

624
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:05,266
Nope.

625
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:11,141
You accidentally left this lighter
where you had just been.

626
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:14,266
And your father doesn't smoke...

627
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:22,975
You unquestionably used this car's lighter
from the passenger seat...

628
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,832
...as your father sat next to you, driving!

629
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:31,008
All other fingerprints
were craftily replaced...

630
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:34,841
Even the seat positions
and mirror angles were perfect...

631
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:41,698
But it seems you overlooked
the cigarette lighter, Mayor Okamoto...

632
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:54,366
My son, Kohei, volunteered
to take my place to save my position...

633
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:59,674
I was really the one driving!

634
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:01,698
I'm so very sorry!

635
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,765
Dad...

636
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,908
As a result of that incident,
Mayor Okamoto lost his position,

637
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:19,065
and his plans for a revitalized
West Tama City were scrapped.

638
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:26,366
Inspector. Do you suppose his son
holds a grudge for what happened?

639
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:32,875
Come to think of it, he was
an electrical engineering student...

640
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:34,165
I'll look into it!

641
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:41,375
Do you remember anything
else about the culprit?

642
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,065
Anything at all...

643
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:47,798
Hmm...

644
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,399
A smell...

645
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:57,808
There was this sweet smell
when he gave Mitsuhiko-kun the plane...

646
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:01,242
There was?
I didn't notice anything!

647
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,875
Me neither...

648
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:06,242
Could the sweet smell have been
from cosmetics or something?

649
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:11,532
I don't know. But it seemed
different from perfume...

650
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,408
A sweet smell?

651
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,508
Alright. If you remember
anything, let me know.

652
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:20,641
We will!

653
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,808
Well, we should probably get going...

654
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,199
Yeah. Conan is all better now...

655
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:32,141
If anything bad happens,
I'll rush straight here!

656
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:34,342
Y-yeah, thanks...

657
00:42:34,366 --> 00:42:35,875
He's so lucky...

658
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,442
We should get hospitalized, too!

659
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:42,865
You certainly are popular
with the girls, lover-boy!

660
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:46,808
He has no idea how to read people...

661
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:49,975
- Well, bye!
- See ya, Conan!

662
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:51,674
Thanks!

663
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:56,665
Still, where could Kudo-kun have gone
at such an important time?!

664
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,508
Wait, Conan!

665
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:08,399
Listen. If it's the bomber,
I'll handle him!

666
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:11,608
Hello?

667
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,941
I'm impressed you found
the bombs. Well done.

668
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:18,732
But children's time is over.
Put Kudo on!

669
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,975
Yes, now it's adult time!

670
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,442
Who's this?!
Where's Kudo?!

671
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:31,108
Kudo isn't here!
Now you're dealing with me!

672
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:34,499
The great detective, Mori Kogoro!

673
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:39,574
Fine. Now listen close;
I'll only say this once!

674
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:42,732
I've planted five bombs
on the Toto Loop Line!

675
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:45,208
Five-

676
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:46,399
-bombs?!

677
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:57,541
If any trains travel below 60 kph
after 4:00 pm, the bombs'll blow.

678
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:03,242
They're also set to explode
if not dismantled by sundown.

679
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,999
I'll give you just one hint...

680
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:12,841
The bombs are planted
"X the X" on the Toto Loop Line.

681
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:15,841
In each "X" goes one word.

682
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:19,532
Well, good luck,
Great Detective Mori.

683
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:28,574
H-he's just bluffing!
Planting bombs on the Loop...

684
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:30,875
No, he means business.

685
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:35,208
He most likely has
the detonators set for 4:00 pm,

686
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:41,266
and if the trains fall below 60 kph
after that... they'll explode.

687
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:47,232
In any case,
I need to contact HQ...

688
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:51,674
It's Megure...

689
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:54,432
I agree with Inspector Megure...

690
00:44:56,598 --> 00:45:03,366
But what exactly is the bomber after?!
Why do something like this?!

691
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,674
Just made it!

692
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:20,432
Today's our lucky day!

693
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,041
"Toto Railway Terminal Station"

694
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:26,008
"Toto Railway Terminal Station"
Bombs on the Loop?!

695
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:26,509
"Toto Railway Traffic Control Room"
Bombs on the Loop?!

696
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:28,030
"Toto Railway Traffic Control Room"
We just received emergency contact

697
00:45:28,054 --> 00:45:29,447
"Toto Railway Traffic Control Room"
from the police department!

698
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:32,108
Understood! I'll stop all trains at once
and have them inspected!

699
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:33,081
"Traffic Dept. Head - Sakaguchi (52)"
"Command Chief - Kusunoki (45)"

700
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,442
No! We can't stop them!

701
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:39,508
The bombs'll explode if the trains
go below 60 kph after 4:00 pm!

702
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:43,199
The bombs'll explode if the trains
go below 60 kph after 4:00 pm!

703
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,598
Say what?!

704
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:49,808
There's only three minutes until 4:00!

705
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:57,342
Order all trains on the Loop
to travel above 60, no, 70 kph!

706
00:45:57,366 --> 00:45:59,442
What about the trains
stopped at stations?!

707
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,841
Get them moving immediately!

708
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:02,541
What about trains
about to stop?

709
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:03,908
Send them through!

710
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:06,541
All we can do is keep
all the trains running nonstop

711
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:08,975
until the bombs are found!

712
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:09,909
Kusunoki-kun!

713
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,299
U-understood!

714
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,508
Emergency orders!
Emergency orders!

715
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:18,908
Attention, all trains!
Someone has planted bombs!

716
00:46:18,932 --> 00:46:21,574
They'll explode if they're
traveling under 60 kph!

717
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:23,574
All trains are to stay at 70 kph!

718
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:26,674
I repeat, someone has planted bombs!

719
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:28,708
They'll explode if they're
traveling under 60 kph!

720
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:30,899
All trains are to stay at 70 kph!

721
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:35,875
Hey, doesn't this train seem strange?

722
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:37,574
How so, Genta-kun?

723
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:42,199
We're almost to Beika Station,
but we're slowly speeding up...

724
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:45,008
Attention, passengers.

725
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:49,698
Due to an emergency, this train
will pass through Beika Station.

726
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:53,598
Hey! What does "emergency" mean?

727
00:46:54,598 --> 00:47:01,932
Due to an emergency, the train
on Line #1 will be passing through.

728
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,041
I see! Alright!

729
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:14,508
Apparently, no trains
have exploded so far.

730
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,108
I've got it, Inspector Megure!

731
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:19,041
Got what?

732
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:25,442
"X the X" means "beneath the seats",
or "above the racks"!

733
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:27,975
That's where the bombs are!

734
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,608
"Under the trains"
is also a possibility.

735
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:34,308
Yes, well...

736
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:39,108
Say, weren't Ayumi-kun and the others
getting on the Loop Line

737
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:42,698
from Midoridai Station
to get back to Beika?

738
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:50,608
Again, this train will continue to run
nonstop for the time being.

739
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:53,108
Should you find a suspicious item onboard,

740
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:56,908
please refrain from touching it
and let the conductor know.

741
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,442
W-what does "suspicious item" mean?!

742
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:01,242
He means something
out of the ordinary!

743
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:04,008
I know that! But what's
"out of the ordinary"?!

744
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:06,208
Well, that would be, uhh...

745
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:07,774
Ayumi-chan, do you read me?!

746
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,674
Conan-kun! I read you!

747
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:11,175
Where are you right now?!

748
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,865
On the Loop...

749
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:15,708
I thought so...

750
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:19,108
Hey, Conan! What in the world's goin' on?

751
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:22,698
Don't tell us there's something
that starts with a "b" on the train?!

752
00:48:24,565 --> 00:48:26,774
Don't worry, it's nothin'!

753
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:32,099
Look! There's no guarantee the bombs
are only inside the trains!

754
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:35,508
- Bombs?!
- I knew it!

755
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:38,342
Does that mean we're gonna die?!

756
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:41,366
Of course not!
I will find where they're hidden!

757
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:44,632
Conan-kun...

758
00:48:46,565 --> 00:48:49,442
Darn it! We can't leave
this all to Conan-kun!

759
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:53,674
We gotta try hard, too! This calls
for the Junior Detective League!

760
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,774
The Junior...

761
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,199
...Detective League?

762
00:48:57,565 --> 00:49:01,865
Y-you're right! The bombs
do seem to be inside the trains!

763
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:07,242
Alright! Let's go,
Junior Detective League!

764
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:08,308
Yeah!

765
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:10,175
W-wait, you guys!

766
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,375
They cut me off!

767
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:14,308
They gonna be alright?!

768
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:17,208
Alright! Got it!

769
00:49:17,232 --> 00:49:21,008
A joint task force
has been assembled at HQ.

770
00:49:21,032 --> 00:49:23,841
I'm off to Toto Railways'
command center.

771
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:26,242
Will you come too?

772
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,865
Yes! I will accompany you!

773
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,008
It's just past 4:30!

774
00:49:33,032 --> 00:49:37,208
Look! All trains on the Toto Loop Line
have continued to run nonstop

775
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:40,598
for over half an hour!

776
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:49,242
Both Toto Railways and the police
department have only commented

777
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:53,632
by saying that there has been
an emergency situation!

778
00:49:55,032 --> 00:49:58,798
30 minutes is the most the police
can keep it under wraps...

779
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:09,032
Borrowed this from a nurse!
It'd be best to watch from your room.

780
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:22,999
Rigging them to explode if they
go under 60 kph makes some sense...

781
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:28,865
...but having them explode if they're
not dismantled before sundown?

782
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:31,499
What's that about?

783
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:36,442
Why would they blow up
when the sun sets?

784
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,199
Does it have something to do
with the trains' lights?

785
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:49,366
Here you are!

786
00:50:52,698 --> 00:50:54,099
Please enjoy!

787
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:59,574
That outfit's pretty sweet!
You look good in red!

788
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,975
Thanks!

789
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:04,199
Both Shinichi and I have red
as our lucky color this month!

790
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:09,708
Come to think of it, I haven't seen
Shinichi-kun in a while either...

791
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:12,342
Maybe I should go with you too!

792
00:51:12,366 --> 00:51:18,641
But it's going to be a boring movie,
plus he's pretty boring himself...

793
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:23,308
I'm just kidding! No one's
gonna get in your guys' way!

794
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:27,308
You get serious so easily, Ran!
That's why I love teasin' ya!

795
00:51:27,332 --> 00:51:29,442
You're so silly, Sonoko...

796
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:33,442
But I'm surprised your dad's
letting you go to an all-night movie!

797
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:37,008
He was against it,
but I ignored him!

798
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:43,532
I bet he and Conan-kun are
discussing dinner right about now!

799
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:51,075
So you couldn't find anything
suspicious inside the trains?!

800
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:52,375
That's right...

801
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:58,108
All 21 trains were thoroughly
searched by their conductors,

802
00:51:58,132 --> 00:52:00,774
but all items had owners!

803
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,408
So, how about your end?

804
00:52:02,432 --> 00:52:08,941
Videos taken along the tracks
showed no bombs under the train cars.

805
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,242
I see...

806
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:12,841
Then where could the bombs be?!

807
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:15,999
Bad news, sir!
The passengers are getting unruly!

808
00:52:18,532 --> 00:52:20,508
How long're you gonna
keep this thing going?!

809
00:52:20,532 --> 00:52:21,808
Just stop it already!

810
00:52:21,832 --> 00:52:26,032
My child has a stomachache!
Please, let us get off!

811
00:52:27,932 --> 00:52:31,574
What is this "suspicious item" anyway?!
Don't tell me it's a bomb?!

812
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:32,808
A-a bomb?!

813
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:35,808
Screw this! I'm gettin' off!
I'm jumpin' out!

814
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:37,865
Calm down, sir! Stop!

815
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,774
Chief Director! I can't keep this up!

816
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:43,708
Hang in there a little longer!

817
00:52:43,732 --> 00:52:48,299
Mori-kun! Have you figured out
any way to locate the bombs?!

818
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:54,299
An hour and a half until sunset...

819
00:52:56,532 --> 00:53:00,041
Still, having them go off
when the sun sets...

820
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:04,574
That's like the exact opposite
of my skateboard...

821
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:10,442
You know, it's solar-powered,
so it doesn't work once the sun sets.

822
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:12,598
The sun?

823
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:16,698
I got it!
I got it, Doc!

824
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:26,908
Megure here!

825
00:53:26,932 --> 00:53:28,242
Inspector! It's Kudo!

826
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:31,475
Oh! Kudo-kun!
I've been waiting!

827
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,175
Dr. Agasa explained everything!

828
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,508
The bombs are not "below the seats",

829
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:41,698
"above the racks",
or "under the trains"!

830
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:44,674
They're "between the tracks"!

831
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:46,342
Between the tracks?!

832
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:52,032
The bombs are set to detonate
after a dozen or so seconds of darkness!

833
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:59,442
When the trains pass over,
the cars block the light for a few seconds!

834
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:04,208
One car is 20 meters in length;
10 cars is 200 meters long.

835
00:54:04,232 --> 00:54:07,774
60 kilometers per hour
is 16.7 meters per second.

836
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:12,308
In other words, it takes about
12 seconds to travel 200 meters!

837
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,598
The bombs are rigged to explode
just barely after that amount of time!

838
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:23,208
So move the trains
onto other lines immediately!

839
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:27,208
There's no danger in stopping them
as long as they're off the Loop!

840
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:28,975
Understood!

841
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,774
Mr. Sakaguchi.
You heard what to do!

842
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:33,199
Right!

843
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:43,708
Divert Train #11 onto the Shibahama
Station cargo line in 3 minutes!

844
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:45,574
Get everything ready!

845
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:49,242
Train #11, Train #11!
Track switch in three minutes!

846
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,975
Shibahama Station,
circuit confirm interlock on!

847
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:54,475
Move all cargo trains
onto emergency sidetracks!

848
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,008
Train #11, passing through
Kawashina Station!

849
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:56,675
"Shibahama Station"

850
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:58,941
"Shibahama Station"
Train #10, passing through Shibahama Station!

851
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:00,266
Switching track!

852
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:16,499
Reducing speed, now!

853
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:22,308
68 kph... 66 kph...

854
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:25,208
64... 63 kph...

855
00:55:25,232 --> 00:55:28,108
62... 61...

856
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,242
60 kph!

857
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:32,641
59! 58 kph!

858
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:33,674
Everything normal?!

859
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,741
Yes! All normal!

860
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:40,141
Alright! Keep slowing and stop
at the next cargo station!

861
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:41,342
Roger that!

862
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:42,641
We did it!

863
00:55:42,665 --> 00:55:48,065
No, we can't rest easy yet!
There are still 20 more trains on the Loop!

872
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:38,366

00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:42,141
We did it! We did it!
We pulled it off!

874
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:46,508
- A truly excellent display of skill!
- Excellent work!

875
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:48,841
Now it's our turn to handle things!

Whew, we finally managed to get off!

878
00:56:56,698 --> 00:57:00,242
I'm never rushing onto
a train last-minute again!

879
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,199
Really?! That's great!

880
00:57:03,865 --> 00:57:07,808
Say, was it you who found
the bombs, Conan-kun?!

881
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:11,208
No, it was Shinichi-niichan
who found them!

882
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:14,765
Though the bombs haven't
actually been found yet...

883
00:57:18,598 --> 00:57:21,641
The bombs are placed
where there wouldn't be shade

884
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:24,674
from buildings or walls after 4:00 pm!

885
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:27,674
When searching, always be aware
of the sun's location

886
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:32,032
and be very careful not to cover
the bombs with your own shadows!

887
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,032
Bomb located!

888
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:50,698
Bomb located!

889
00:57:55,032 --> 00:57:56,032
Bomb located!

890
00:57:58,032 --> 00:57:59,099
Bomb located!

891
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,541
Bomb located!

892
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,032
Understood!

893
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:08,208
The five bombs have been
safely collected.

894
00:58:08,232 --> 00:58:09,674
- Yes!
- Alright!

895
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:13,075
It was all as Kudo-kun deduced...

896
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,841
Fifteen minutes until sunset...

897
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:17,632
Talk about a close call...

898
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:23,674
But it's too early to celebrate...

899
00:58:23,698 --> 00:58:27,741
The amount of explosives used so far
accounts for only one-fourth

900
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:30,308
of the stolen quantity...

901
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:35,366
Meaning that the bomber still has
the remaining three-fourths?!

902
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,308
Sorry I'm late.

903
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,041
So, what'd you find out?

904
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:45,574
Well, about Mayor Okamoto's son Kohei...

905
00:58:45,598 --> 00:58:50,175
I learned that he left
early this morning for the Izu area.

906
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,141
Which means he's innocent...

907
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:53,342
Yes...

908
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:55,975
Umm, about the bombing incident...

909
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,875
Solved.

910
00:58:57,899 --> 00:58:59,875
All thanks to Kudo-kun...

911
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:03,408
The issue now is the remaining
explosives and the bomber's identity.

912
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:07,908
About all we know for sure
is that the bomber doesn't live near

913
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:12,399
any of the five spots
along the Loop, right?

914
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:20,508
Right?! If the bombs blew up,
entire trains could've been sent flying!

915
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,908
He wouldn't risk that
near his own house-

916
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:30,865
Could that also be why he stopped
the timer in the carrying case?!

917
00:59:32,032 --> 00:59:35,908
There was a playground and
an apartment building nearby...

918
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:40,442
That's it! The bomber
lives in those apartments!

919
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:43,798
Alright! Straight to those apartments!

920
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:47,975
Nothing at all?!

921
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:53,308
Yes. We checked not just that building,
but all other nearby houses...

922
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:55,774
But they were all in the clear...

923
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:57,308
Oh...

924
00:59:57,332 --> 01:00:03,308
Say, Inspector. What kind of places
were the train bombs planted at?

925
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:07,342
What kind? Just regular
ol' residential areas...

926
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:12,208
Oh, yes. There was one on a bridge,
over the Sumida Canal.

927
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:13,698
On a bridge?

928
01:00:16,132 --> 01:00:17,865
Isn't this that bridge?

929
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:24,208
Hold on...

930
01:00:24,232 --> 01:00:27,366
Wasn't there a photo of this
in Professor Moriya's gallery?

931
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:33,965
Say, didn't Professor Moriya
design this bridge?

932
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:36,208
He did?

933
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,532
That's correct.

934
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,574
Moriya Teiji designed it.

935
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:45,242
The bridge was completed in 1983,

936
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,641
and the fact it was built of stone
in an English style instead of iron

937
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:50,641
was quite the topic at the time.

938
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:53,008
With this bridge's design,
Moriya Teiji won

939
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:55,841
the Architectural Association
of Japan's Newcomer Award!

940
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:58,841
You certainly are well-informed!

941
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:01,366
Architecture interests me...

942
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:07,999
-the recent series of arson
incidents. Police believe-

943
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,342
That's enough.
It's distracting.

944
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,366
'Kay...

945
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:16,308
Come to think of it, the Kurokawa
mansion that was set on fire

946
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:18,432
was also designed
by Professor Moriya...

947
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:26,732
Say, I wonder who designed
all these houses that were set on fire!

948
01:01:27,999 --> 01:01:32,342
I bet we might find something
interesting if we look into it!

949
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:34,499
Interesting, indeed...

950
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,541
I'll go now.

951
01:01:44,565 --> 01:01:47,242
Okay. Thanks for coming with me today!

952
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:49,541
Better give me the details later!

953
01:01:49,565 --> 01:01:52,065
Steal at least a kiss from him!

954
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:06,199
9:00...

955
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,798
In one hour...

956
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:15,075
Say what?! They were all
designed by Mr. Moriya?!

957
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,042
Yes.

958
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:20,208
The Kurokawa, Mizushima,
Yasuda, and Akutsu mansions-

959
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:22,841
which were all burned down-

960
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:25,865
were designed by Professor
Moriya in his early 30s.

961
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:30,308
Hard to think it's a coincidence...

962
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:35,532
Maybe the bombs on the Loop
were really meant for that bridge, too!

963
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:37,875
That bridge?!

964
01:02:37,899 --> 01:02:38,908
It's quite possible.

965
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:41,875
The bomber could be the arsonist,

966
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:44,541
who's going after
Professor Moriya's designs!

967
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:47,908
Aha! That's it, Inspector!

968
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:51,075
The culprit is someone with a grudge
against Professor Moriya,

969
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:53,475
or someone who's jealous of his success!

970
01:02:53,499 --> 01:02:57,442
His challenge to Shinichi
was just camouflage!

971
01:02:57,466 --> 01:03:00,041
I see. It is highly likely...

972
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:01,674
I agree.

973
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:06,208
Homemade igniters were used
during each arson!

974
01:03:06,232 --> 01:03:09,698
I now realize they have something
in common with the bombings!

975
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:14,708
Everything being targeted
is work from his 30s...

976
01:03:14,732 --> 01:03:18,208
Alright! For now, let's go speak
with Professor Moriya!

977
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:20,175
Mori-kun! Lead the way!

978
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,674
Right, where was it again?

979
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,208
I remember, mister!

980
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:25,708
I'll lead the way!

981
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:27,674
Don't be silly!
You're still not-

982
01:03:27,698 --> 01:03:29,908
I'm all better now! Come on!

983
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,132
Hey, wait!

984
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:35,299
I leave it to you, Shinichi...

985
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:44,199
Mori-san. Just ahead is where
the bomb timer temporarily stopped...

986
01:03:49,565 --> 01:03:51,774
A playground...

987
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:56,698
Yeesh! We wasted so much time,
all because of those crude bombs!

988
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:17,508
I see. That's indeed too much
to be a mere coincidence...

989
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:21,908
Can you think of anyone who might
do something like this?

990
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:25,032
Hmm, let me think...

991
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:30,641
That's a photograph from
when I was ten, Conan-kun.

992
01:04:30,665 --> 01:04:33,399
With me are my mother and father.

993
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:38,808
Your father must be a really
great person, Professor Moriya!

994
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:42,008
He was a world-renowned architect.

995
01:04:42,032 --> 01:04:44,641
He was particularly active in England...

996
01:04:44,665 --> 01:04:47,565
I was a big fan of his architecture...

997
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,641
I believe he passed away-

998
01:04:50,665 --> 01:04:54,008
-fifteen years ago,
in a fire at his villa.

999
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:55,875
Together with my mother...

1000
01:04:55,899 --> 01:04:59,366
I inherited this mansion
after it happened.

1001
01:05:00,332 --> 01:05:06,199
And that's when your designs suddenly began
to get the spotlight, right, Moriya-san?

1002
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:09,375
Yes, that's right...

1003
01:05:09,399 --> 01:05:12,541
Huh?! This smell...

1004
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:14,508
Could it be?!

1005
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:18,308
Moriya-san. Do you have any ideas
who could be behind this?

1006
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,965
Oh, right...

1007
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:38,875
This is where his works
from his 30s begin!

1008
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:40,108
The Kurokawa mansion...

1009
01:05:40,132 --> 01:05:41,541
The Mizushima mansion...

1010
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:43,475
The Yasuda mansion
and the Akutsu mansion...

1011
01:05:43,499 --> 01:05:45,099
And then the bridge...

1012
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:48,099
Wait a minute!
This bridge-

1013
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:52,141
No doubt about it!

1014
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:57,541
I was still inept in my youth.
Please don't pay them much attention...

1015
01:05:57,565 --> 01:06:00,475
No way! Is that even plausible?!

1016
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:02,732
But that smell...

1017
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:07,508
Was this here last time?

1018
01:06:07,532 --> 01:06:11,032
"My Visionary New Town,
West Tama City"?

1019
01:06:11,965 --> 01:06:13,475
Come to think of it...

1020
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:16,508
As a result of that incident,
Mayor Okamoto lost his position,

1021
01:06:16,532 --> 01:06:24,266
and his plans for a revitalized
West Tama City were scrapped.

1022
01:06:24,698 --> 01:06:28,865
I get it! It was Professor
Moriya who was planning this!

1023
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:47,432
A new town,
with perfect symmetry...

1024
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:54,908
It's the same as the lampposts
in the playground!

1025
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:58,141
Ah! So that's why-

1026
01:06:58,165 --> 01:07:00,308
That person is the culprit, after all!

1027
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:02,242
But there's no proof.

1028
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:05,999
Guess I'll just have to wing it...

1029
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,741
Perfect!

1030
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:19,698
Now for some scissors,
tape, and a marker...

1031
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:24,132
A lighter?

1032
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,975
I see. So you can't think of anyone...

1033
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:30,208
I apologize for not being of use.

1034
01:07:30,232 --> 01:07:34,975
Well, if you can think of anything,
please let us know.

1035
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:36,532
Where's Conan-kun?

1036
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:39,665
Pardon me...

1037
01:07:41,065 --> 01:07:42,442
This is Megure...

1038
01:07:42,466 --> 01:07:44,232
Oh! Kudo-kun!

1039
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:49,975
Okay! Got it! I'll gather everyone
in the gallery right away!

1040
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:54,841
Moriya-san. I'm sorry to ask,
but could we see your gallery?

1041
01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:59,674
Very well. But would you mind
if I stopped by my study first?

1042
01:07:59,698 --> 01:08:00,865
Not at all!

1043
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:13,366
Sorry for the delay.
Right this way...

1044
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,632
The gallery is on the second floor.

1045
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:21,399
Right in here...

1046
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:37,541
Megure here.
Yes, we're in the gallery now.

1047
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:41,442
Inspector Megure. Press the speaker
button so that everyone can hear.

1048
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:42,366
Alright...

1049
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:48,674
Actually, I've figured out who's behind
these arsons and bombings!

1050
01:08:48,698 --> 01:08:52,408
You have?!
Who is it?!

1051
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:55,366
Hold it! I've figured it out, too!

1052
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,032
The culprit is you,
Detective Shiratori!

1053
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:01,065
What?!

1054
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:05,608
As someone with deep respect
for Professor Moriya's father,

1055
01:09:05,632 --> 01:09:09,574
you were suspicious about his death
and began to suspect his son,

1056
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:13,075
who had stepped into the spotlight
immediately afterward!

1057
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:16,908
You were suspicious that he
had set the fire that killed him!

1058
01:09:16,932 --> 01:09:22,875
Certain of this, you set fire to each
of Professor Moriya's buildings!

1059
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:28,175
Your respect for the father became
desire for revenge against the son!

1060
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:33,442
What's more, you were always absent
whenever the bomber called!

1061
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:35,841
H-hold on, now!

1062
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:38,841
Well, Shinichi?! Isn't that
what you wanna say, too?!

1063
01:09:38,865 --> 01:09:39,642
No!

1064
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,065
What?!

1065
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:44,674
These incidents were not
perpetrated by someone

1066
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:47,574
with a grudge against Professor Moriya!

1067
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:50,841
The one responsible is the designer
of the four mansions set on fire,

1068
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:55,132
as well as the bridge...
You, Professor Moriya!

1069
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,999
What?!

1070
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:06,674
You idiot! What kind of architect
destroys his own work?!

1071
01:10:06,698 --> 01:10:12,008
Early on, Professor Moriya inherited
his father's architectural talent,

1072
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:16,408
and in his early 30s, he made his unusually
young debut into the architectural world.

1073
01:10:16,432 --> 01:10:18,108
Hello?

1074
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:21,242
And with his design
of the bridge on the Loop,

1075
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:25,674
he won the Architectural Association
of Japan's Newcomer Award!

1076
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:29,975
Professor Moriya continued
to produce new buildings after that,

1077
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:34,541
when he suddenly-
or maybe not so suddenly-

1078
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:38,141
wanted to get rid of the works
he created in his youth.

1079
01:10:38,165 --> 01:10:43,199
This can be surmised from the
professor's words at the tea party...

1080
01:10:43,932 --> 01:10:47,975
Most young architects these days
lack artistic sense!

1081
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:52,375
They need to feel much more
responsibility for their works!

1082
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,375
In short, you put those words into action.

1083
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,674
That does sound familiar...

1084
01:10:57,698 --> 01:11:00,841
Hold on! You weren't even
at his party! How do you-

1085
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:03,041
- Now then, everyone.
- Hey...

1086
01:11:03,065 --> 01:11:05,175
Have a look at the panel photographs.

1087
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:09,008
Look closely at the Kurokawa mansion,
the Mizushima mansion, the Yasuda mansion,

1088
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:12,674
and the Akutsu mansion,
as well as the bridge.

1089
01:11:12,698 --> 01:11:16,741
They each use classic
English-style architecture,

1090
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:19,674
but do you notice anything about them?

1091
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:23,975
They all look like splendid
works of architecture to me...

1092
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:26,242
They're not perfectly symmetrical!

1093
01:11:26,266 --> 01:11:30,674
Correct! Their left-right
symmetries are slightly off.

1094
01:11:30,698 --> 01:11:33,308
Most likely, the clients
ordered it that way,

1095
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:38,641
or he had to compromise
due to building laws or the like.

1096
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:44,208
Professor Moriya, being a perfectionist,
couldn't stand that.

1097
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:47,175
Around the same time,
a shadow began to creep

1098
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,808
into his life as an architect,
which had been smooth-sailing until then.

1099
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:53,908
His plan for a revitalized
West Tama City,

1100
01:11:53,932 --> 01:11:57,141
which he had spent
a great deal of time on...

1101
01:11:57,165 --> 01:12:01,065
...was suddenly cancelled
as a result of the mayor's arrest!

1102
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:06,041
Ah! So Professor Moriya
designed this, too?!

1103
01:12:06,065 --> 01:12:10,008
By challenging me and tarnishing
my name as a high school detective,

1104
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:12,308
the professor hoped
to exact revenge on me,

1105
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:17,608
while also trying to camouflage
his goal-the bridge's destruction-

1106
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:21,199
to look unrelated to the recent
string of mansion arsons!

1107
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,975
And the reason he stopped
the bomb timer in the carrying case...

1108
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:30,475
...was because of the gas
lampposts in the playground!

1109
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:34,532
They were a symbol
of his new West Tama City!

1110
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:38,375
The professor didn't want
to destroy them;

1111
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,674
he designed them to resemble
the ones from his beloved London!

1112
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,032
Am I wrong?!

1113
01:12:47,065 --> 01:12:49,574
An interesting theory, Kudo-kun...

1114
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:53,674
But unfortunately,
there is no proof.

1115
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:56,865
Oh, but there is...
Behind the model case!

1116
01:13:00,132 --> 01:13:02,574
This is the bomber's disguise!

1117
01:13:02,598 --> 01:13:04,808
Impossible!
That's in my safe in the study!

1118
01:13:04,832 --> 01:13:10,975
Oh, so the bomber's disguise
is actually hidden in your safe?

1119
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,099
What?!

1120
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:17,075
These are my glasses!

1121
01:13:17,099 --> 01:13:19,366
I painted them black with a marker!

1122
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:25,508
I made the mustache and wig
by cutting that helmet's decorative hair

1123
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:27,475
and then taping it together!

1124
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:30,366
These were all Shinichi-niichan's ideas!

1125
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,532
Professor Moriya. I must
ask you to come down to the-

1126
01:13:35,132 --> 01:13:36,175
Don't move!

1127
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:39,532
Move, and I'll blow the bombs
I set in this mansion!

1128
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:42,674
They won't blow up.

1129
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:44,975
After all, that detonator...

1130
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,242
...has no batteries!

1131
01:13:46,266 --> 01:13:47,598
Impossible!

1132
01:13:49,366 --> 01:13:50,975
W-when did you-

1133
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:53,674
How did you know this was a detonator?!

1134
01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:56,574
Well, you don't use lighters!

1135
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,366
Plus you used long matches
to light your pipe...

1136
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:05,674
...and the sweet smell Ayumi-chan
mentioned was your pipe's smell!

1137
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:07,499
Arrest him!

1138
01:14:10,732 --> 01:14:14,041
Alright! That solves all the cases!

1139
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:15,741
What a happy ending!

1140
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:21,674
It's hardly happy, Mori-san!
You're horrible, calling people criminals!

1141
01:14:21,698 --> 01:14:26,698
Yeah, sorry about that! Even monkeys
fall from trees, as they say!

1142
01:14:27,632 --> 01:14:31,698
Though in his case,
his theories fell instead...

1143
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:37,875
You're gravely mistaken if you think
you've resolved everything.

1144
01:14:37,899 --> 01:14:41,532
There is one other building
I wanted to get rid of!

1145
01:14:44,798 --> 01:14:46,865
No! The Beika City Building?!

1146
01:14:48,132 --> 01:14:51,008
Don't tell me it doesn't
have perfect symmetry too?!

1147
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:53,908
All because of the absurd reason
that the building budget was lost

1148
01:14:53,932 --> 01:14:56,641
due to the bubble economy's collapse!

1149
01:14:56,665 --> 01:14:59,808
It's my grandest
and lousiest work of all!

1150
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:02,841
None of you would ever
understand my aesthetics!

1151
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:06,875
Well, then.
One minute to 10:00...

1152
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:07,999
Ran...

1153
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:13,865
"Beika City Building -
Beika Cinema 1"

1154
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,342
Yes, this is Mori...

1155
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,598
Ran-neechan!
Get out, quick!

1156
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:44,975
Ran-neechan! Are you okay?!
Ran-neechan!

1157
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,242
Gimme that!

1158
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:49,342
Hey, Ran! What happened?!
Respond! Ran!

1159
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:51,141
Damn it!

1160
01:15:51,165 --> 01:15:55,242
What the hell are you doing to my Ran?!

1161
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:59,242
I've only blocked the lobby's entrance
and emergency exits so far.

1162
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:00,875
The best is yet to come...

1163
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:02,175
What?!

1164
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:05,442
Hey, Kudo! I assume you're
listening from somewhere!

1165
01:16:05,466 --> 01:16:09,908
You better hurry before your
beloved girlfriend winds up in scraps!

1166
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,841
You'll pay for this!

1167
01:16:11,865 --> 01:16:13,199
Mori-kun!
No violence!

1168
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:17,899
What're you doing, kid?!

1169
01:16:20,266 --> 01:16:21,741
These are-

1170
01:16:21,765 --> 01:16:24,674
- What the-Bomb blueprints?!
- What?!

1171
01:16:24,698 --> 01:16:27,108
I'll go give them to Shinichi-niichan!

1172
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:28,308
Hold on!

1173
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:31,132
I'll send the bomb
disposal unit right away!

1174
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:39,865
I can't wait for the bomb disposal unit!

1175
01:16:41,266 --> 01:16:43,108
Wait!

1176
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:45,199
If you see Kudo,
tell him this!

1177
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:50,284
"I gave you three minutes!
Enjoy it all you can!"

1178
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,574
Wait, Conan-kun!

1179
01:16:53,598 --> 01:16:55,975
Shiratori-kun!
Take care of Professor Moriya!

1180
01:16:55,999 --> 01:16:57,032
Right!

1181
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:33,275
Ran!

1182
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:35,574
Where are you, Ran?!

1183
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:37,442
Ran! Ran!
Damn it!

1184
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:38,343
Mori-kun!

1185
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,342
Ran!

1186
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:44,342
Inspector! What are
the rescue units doing?!

1187
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:46,732
Calm down, Mori-kun!
Calm down!

1188
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:52,366
Hold on, Ran!
I'm coming!

1189
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:15,626
It's all right!
Help will be here soon!

1190
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:23,574
- Hello?
- R-Ran?!

1191
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,375
S- Shinichi?!

1192
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:28,141
Lucky! Looks like the phone lines
haven't been cut yet!

1193
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:32,308
Where were you?! You're always gone
at the most important times!

1194
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:35,508
You're really always-always-

1195
01:18:35,532 --> 01:18:38,442
Do you even know what
situation I'm in now?!

1196
01:18:38,466 --> 01:18:40,442
Yeah, I know.

1197
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:44,598
I'm right in front of the emergency exit;
it's blocked with debris...

1198
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:53,705
I managed to squeeze through
the rubble to get here...

1199
01:18:54,065 --> 01:18:55,848
...but the shock from the bomb...

1200
01:18:57,601 --> 01:19:01,813
...seems to have deformed the door,
so there's no way to open it...

1201
01:19:02,228 --> 01:19:07,475
Say, is there anything weird in the lobby,
like a briefcase or suitcase?

1202
01:19:07,532 --> 01:19:08,789
Weird?

1203
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,242
What is this?
It's really heavy and big!

1204
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:30,032
And there's this digital clock on it...

1205
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:32,612
Be careful!
That's a bomb!

1206
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,231
A bomb?!

1207
01:19:37,798 --> 01:19:41,323
Damn you, Professor!
You put the biggest one here!

1208
01:19:41,702 --> 01:19:43,367
Ran! What's the timer say?!

1209
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,824
Hold on!

1210
01:19:46,905 --> 01:19:49,308
42 minutes and 7 seconds...

1211
01:19:49,332 --> 01:19:51,442
42 minutes, huh...

1212
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:53,722
Which means it'll explode
three minutes after midnight...

1213
01:19:54,299 --> 01:19:55,832
Three minutes?

1214
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:59,466
"I gave you three minutes!
Enjoy it all you can!"

1215
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:02,199
What is this "three minutes" thing?!

1216
01:20:06,232 --> 01:20:06,809
Well?!

1217
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:09,475
It's no use! All stairwells
are buried in debris;

1218
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:14,466
it'll take more time to reach the people
trapped in the 5th floor lobby!

1219
01:20:16,299 --> 01:20:17,299
Ran...

1220
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:21,665
18 minutes left!

1221
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,091
There's no time left!
We have no choice...

1222
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,598
Hey, Ran! Do you got
any scissors on you?

1223
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:31,698
I have sewing kit scissors,
but what are we going to do with those?

1224
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:36,972
You're going to disarm the bomb!

1225
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:41,315
Now listen, follow my instructions...

1226
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:44,940
Wait! I can't do it while on the phone!

1227
01:20:44,993 --> 01:20:46,353
I'll go by you!

1228
01:20:46,378 --> 01:20:47,378
Wait!

1229
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:52,232
Alright. There doesn't seem to be
a vibration detector on it...

1230
01:20:52,495 --> 01:20:53,813
But do it gently!

1231
01:20:53,838 --> 01:20:54,938
Alright!

1232
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,432
Can you hear me, Shinichi?

1233
01:21:07,457 --> 01:21:09,557
Yeah, loud and clear!

1234
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:13,999
I'm tearing the bag now.

1235
01:21:14,112 --> 01:21:15,212
Be careful!

1236
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:26,618
What is it Ran?
Are you all right?

1237
01:21:26,805 --> 01:21:29,205
Y-yeah... I'm fine...

1238
01:21:39,713 --> 01:21:42,275
Okay! I'm ready!

1239
01:21:42,299 --> 01:21:47,437
Alright. First, let's remove
the outer cover. Pull it up and off.

1240
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:48,775
Gently, now!

1241
01:21:48,799 --> 01:21:50,132
R-right...

1242
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,658
It's off, Shinichi!

1243
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:59,471
Great! Now we're going
to cut the wiring inside...

1244
01:22:00,505 --> 01:22:03,171
Mess up the order in the
slightest and we're goners!

1245
01:22:06,099 --> 01:22:09,466
First, the yellow cord
near the bottom...

1246
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,308
I'm cutting it!

1247
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,865
Okay!

1248
01:22:26,099 --> 01:22:28,479
Inspector! Don't tell me Ran is-

1249
01:22:28,504 --> 01:22:32,576
Calm down, Mori-kun!
That isn't where Ran-kun is!

1250
01:22:32,601 --> 01:22:37,228
Don't worry! Your daughter still has
15 minutes until she's blown up!

1251
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:42,874
Damn you! Talk!
How do we stop the bomb?!

1252
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:45,026
It's a special bomb, you see...

1253
01:22:45,232 --> 01:22:51,032
Even if it can be disarmed,
the last wire will determine her fate!

1254
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:57,532
Several pillars of smoke are rising
from the Beika City Building-

1255
01:23:04,285 --> 01:23:05,514
It's cut.

1256
01:23:07,413 --> 01:23:10,221
Alright... It looks like
we'll make it in time!

1257
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,536
Once we cut the final black cord,
the timer'll stop!

1258
01:23:13,783 --> 01:23:15,299
The black cord?

1259
01:23:19,899 --> 01:23:21,774
S- Shinichi...

1260
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:25,500
I cut the black cord,
but the timer isn't stopping...

1261
01:23:26,226 --> 01:23:29,108
P-plus there are still two cords left!

1262
01:23:29,132 --> 01:23:30,608
A red one and a blue one!

1263
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:31,865
What?!

1264
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:39,132
The path to the 4th floor
stairway is finally open!

1265
01:23:39,426 --> 01:23:43,386
Hurry! There's only four
minutes until it detonates!

1266
01:23:43,411 --> 01:23:45,312
Ran! Ran!
I'm coming!

1267
01:23:45,466 --> 01:23:46,447
Mori-san!

1268
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:48,541
Where are you going, Mori-san?!

1269
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,875
Let go of me!
I have to save Ran!

1270
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:54,442
Please stop!
The rescue team will save-

1271
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:56,798
Ran! Ran!

1272
01:23:57,798 --> 01:24:00,865
The hapless love of a father
for his daughter...

1273
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:03,342
Architecture has no need for love...

1274
01:24:03,366 --> 01:24:04,899
Nor does life!

1275
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:10,346
Wait, Professor! Don't tell me
you purposely left out the two wires

1276
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:12,191
to set me up?!

1277
01:24:12,879 --> 01:24:15,446
What should I do?
Cut them both?

1278
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:17,981
You idiot!
One of them's a booby trap!

1279
01:24:18,029 --> 01:24:19,606
It'll blow the instant you cut it!

1280
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:21,465
A-are you serious?!

1281
01:24:29,049 --> 01:24:31,242
Damn! Which is it?!

1282
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,132
Red or blue?!
Which should we cut?!

1283
01:24:49,804 --> 01:24:52,797
Midnight...
Three minutes left...

1284
01:24:52,974 --> 01:24:55,974
Damn it! Which is it?!
Which one?!

1285
01:24:56,198 --> 01:24:57,072
Shinichi?

1286
01:24:57,705 --> 01:24:58,639
Yeah?

1287
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:02,545
Happy birthday, Shinichi...

1288
01:25:04,112 --> 01:25:05,184
After all...

1289
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:11,017

get to say it again...

It doesn't matter.

We're goners anyway,

have red as our lucky color for May!

You're safe now,
little boy! Let's go!

W-wait! There are still
people trapped inside!

Alright, wait here!

1323
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:20,660

Today's my wedding anniversary,

1326
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:27,311
but it doesn't look like
I'll be enjoying it much...

01:27:28,798 --> 01:27:32,499
"I gave you three minutes!
Enjoy it all you can!"

1328
01:27:33,365 --> 01:27:38,933
I get it! He was telling me
to enjoy three minutes of my birthday!

1329
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:42,674
Wait! Wasn't that when-

1330
01:27:42,698 --> 01:27:45,774
Oh, that sounds like fun!

1331
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:48,575
I take it you've already
gotten him a present?

1332
01:27:48,599 --> 01:27:50,774
No, on Saturday
I'm going to-

1333
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:54,441
He and I both like
the color red!

1334
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:57,499
And we both have red
as our lucky color for May!

1335
01:27:57,931 --> 01:28:00,174
Lucky color?

1336
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:01,332
Oh no!

1339
01:28:07,731 --> 01:28:09,707
Cut the blue one!
Don't cut the red one!

It's so wonderful that Ran-kun
is all right, Mori-kun!

01:29:49,465 --> 01:29:51,375
Yes! Thank you!

1348
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:53,174
- I'm with Nichiuri TV!
- Give us your thoughts!

1349
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:55,174
What role did the great detective play?!

1350
01:29:55,198 --> 01:30:01,475
These bombings were meant
to tarnish my name as a great detective

1351
01:30:01,499 --> 01:30:04,731
by leading my daughter Ran
into a trap that-

1352
01:30:07,765 --> 01:30:08,765
Oh!

1353
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,141
Conan-kun! You came
because you were worried?

1354
01:30:16,165 --> 01:30:17,674
Yeah...

1355
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:19,807
Where'd you get that bandage?

1356
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,475
Oh, I just fell...

1357
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,707
You need to be careful.

1358
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:26,641
Say, Conan-kun.
Have you seen Shinichi?

1359
01:30:26,665 --> 01:30:29,575
Huh? He was just here a minute ago...

1360
01:30:29,599 --> 01:30:32,575
Ugh! After I went
and got him a present...

1361
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:36,341
Come to think of it,
Shinichi-niichan did seem puzzled!

1362
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:39,575
He thought you'd pick
the red wire for sure,

1363
01:30:39,599 --> 01:30:43,008
so he was wondering
why you cut the blue one instead...

1364
01:30:43,032 --> 01:30:45,698
I didn't want to cut it.

1365
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:48,141
"Legend of the Red Thread"

1366
01:30:48,165 --> 01:30:49,475
"Legend of the Red Thread"
After all, Shinichi and I...

1367
01:30:49,499 --> 01:30:52,308
After all, Shinichi and I...

1368
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:54,499
...might be connected!

1369
01:31:25,165 --> 01:31:32,974
I truly feel sorry for not
being able to say things well

1370
01:31:32,998 --> 01:31:40,575
I mulled it over a while, but I
eventually fell asleep from exhaustion

1371
01:31:40,599 --> 01:31:48,575
On the weekends, this town's air
is stuffy and makes me choke,

1372
01:31:48,599 --> 01:31:56,098
and when I sighed deeply, it was
blotted out by the outdoor speakers

1373
01:31:57,365 --> 01:32:11,641
Even when I put the words together,
they're never meant to be said

1374
01:32:11,665 --> 01:32:26,807
The voice I shout as loudly as I can
into the sky over this bustling city

1375
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:35,831
is my "Happy Birthday" to that person,
in some other faraway city

1376
01:32:52,298 --> 01:33:07,332
The voice I shout as loudly as I can
into the sky over this bustling city

1377
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:23,041
The voice I shout as loudly as I can
into the sky over this bustling city

1378
01:33:23,065 --> 01:33:32,998
is my "Happy Birthday" to that person,
in some other faraway city

1379
01:33:59,265 --> 01:34:02,907
T-there's no red thread!

1380
01:34:02,931 --> 01:34:06,065
Guess that means I'm outta luck
as long as I'm Conan...
