1
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,108
That's amazing!

2
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,691
It flew up in the blink of an eye!

3
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,234
It went really high up too!

4
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,525
Let me see!

5
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:49,608
Me too!

6
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,651
Hold on!

7
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,191
It can ascend up to 10 thousand metres...

8
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,526
...in 30 minutes!

9
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:59,192
That would have made it into the
world's record for drones.

10
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,151
Anyway, how do you even control it
at that height?

11
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,276
By using satellite signals.

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,609
That way, it can be controlled
no matter how far away.

13
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:14,566
The video and coordinates data sent back
from the drone...

14
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,567
...are the actual data received
from the drone itself.

15
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,233
It's not easy to control the direction,

16
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:23,609
speed and camera all at the same time.

17
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:26,941
But why did you make a drone like that?

18
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:28,109
Why, you ask?

19
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:31,151
It's every man's dream!

20
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,358
With this, I can climb Mt. Everest...

21
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,609
...without physically having to be there!

22
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,859
What a creepy laugh.

23
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,733
I foresee this new device giving rise to

24
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:47,901
multiple legal issues.

25
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,358
We will bring you the latest news

26
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,316
of the upcoming Summit Meeting in Tokyo...

27
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,359
...right after the commercial.

28
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,733
Next week, the summit will be held

29
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,775
at the international conference hall
located in Edge of Ocean,

30
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:04,401
the integrated resort
built on reclaimed land.

31
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:08,358
Scheduled to open to public from next month,

32
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:12,441
the Edge of Ocean has various facilities...

33
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,442
...incorporating water in its design,
befitting of a coastal city.

34
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:18,483
The Casino Tower's design,
inspired by seashells,

35
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:21,983
will also serve its purpose as a beacon
to safeguard the ocean itself.

36
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,816
From this tower, one can have a
bird's eye view of the Edge of Ocean.

37
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,650
Located right beside the Casino Tower,
this shopping mall has...

38
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,108
...a huge waterfall,

39
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,941
and a sky garden,

40
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,692
for visitors to feel at ease.

41
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,191
And there's one more concept.

42
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,483
The interior of the
conference hall was inspired by...

43
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,317
...the breathtaking beauty
of Japanese gardens.

44
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:48,234
On the first floor, is a posh restaurant.

45
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,775
Have a look over here!

46
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:54,483
The double-deck monorail
that circles the perimeter!

47
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:56,816
This smart city has an artistic blend

48
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,817
of traditional and futuristic.

49
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:01,317
As you can see,

50
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,067
Edge of Ocean is connected by two bridges.

51
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:09,858
On 1st of May, the day of the summit,

52
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,816
the Metropolitan Police Department,
who are in-charge of security,

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,734
will have up to 22,000 police officers
in the city.

54
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,734
Next up, the latest news
on the unmanned probe, "Swan"!

55
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:54,441
I am high school student detective,
Kudo Shinichi.

56
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:56,400
One day, at an amusement park
with my childhood friend

57
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,191
and classmate Mori Ran,

58
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,859
I witnessed a suspicious transaction
between some men in black.

59
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,358
Too engrossed in watching,

60
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,608
I failed to notice another of his accomplices

61
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,192
approach me from behind.

62
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:15,734
I was drugged and when I woke up...

63
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,192
My body had shrunk!

64
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,941
If those men knew that
Kudo Shinichi was still alive,

65
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,567
they would target my life again
and also endanger those around me.

66
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:34,317
Taking Professor Agasa's advice,
I hid my identity.

67
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,441
But when Ran asked for my name,

68
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:39,775
I spontaneously told her
it was "Edogawa Conan".

69
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,733
Because Ran's father is a detective,

70
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:45,192
I moved in with her family
to gather information on those men.

71
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,525
These kids are Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi;

72
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,526
classmates of my shrunken form.

73
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,233
And this is Haibara Ai,

74
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:57,984
whose real name is Miyano Shiho.

75
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:02,109
She was a former member
of the Black Organisation.

76
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,900
When she drank the same drug
in an attempt to kill herself,

77
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,776
her body shrunk too.

78
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:13,192
And a member of this mysterious organisation,

79
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:15,692
code-named "Bourbon", is Amuro Tooru

80
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,941
whose real identity is an agent of
the secret department nicknamed "Zero",

81
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:23,317
a department that commands the
National Police Agency Security Bureau.

82
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,941
To keep things under wraps,

83
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,941
he works part-time in Café Poirot

84
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:31,692
while being Mouri Kogoro's apprentice.

85
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,026
Even though my body has shrunk,

86
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,942
my intelligence remains.

87
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,442
There is always only one truth!

88
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:53,775
The unmanned probe, Swan,
has completed its survey of Mars...

89
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:58,567
...and will finally return to Earth
on 1st of May.

90
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,566
During its return trip,
the probe's main body...

91
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,025
...will combust in the atmosphere,

92
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:06,733
and a returning capsule of
approximately four metres in diameter...

93
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,984
...will re-enter the atmosphere.

94
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,691
Upon which, it will descend via parachute...

95
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:15,733
...into the Pacific Ocean west of Japan.

96
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:16,734
I see.

97
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,608
Within the capsule itself is a GPS

98
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:22,816
with a precise navigation system.

99
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,275
This makes it possible to keep it

100
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,609
within a 200-metre diameter
of the landing point!

101
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:30,816
Hold on, Genta!

102
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,276
Let me try too!

103
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,567
I want to try too!

104
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,358
Perhaps I ought to split the controller
into three parts

105
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,109
for direction, speed and camera?

106
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:49,151
We have a news flash.

107
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:53,691
There has been a huge explosion
at the international conference hall...

108
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,192
...scheduled to host the Tokyo Summit
next week.

109
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,276
Here is footage from the surveillance camera.

110
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,859
This is...

111
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,191
Because the intergrated resort,
Edge of Ocean...

112
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,066
...has yet to be open to the public,

113
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,941
- Professor!
- there were no visitors.

114
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,775
Multiple casualties were suffered

115
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:20,567
by the police
in charge of the area's security.

116
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:21,776
According to the police's statement,

117
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:25,358
- That could be a terrorist attack.
- there was a huge explosion

118
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,483
- But isn't the summit next week?
- at the integrated resort, Edge of Ocean.

119
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:31,775
- Maybe it was an accident.
- The number of casualties

120
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,566
and cause of the incident...

121
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,816
...are still unclear
and currently under investigation.

122
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,650
The casualties were police officers?
How worrying.

123
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,191
Professor! The video is gone!

124
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,358
Right, I'm coming over!

125
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,691
Come to think of it,

126
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,691
if a terrorist incident took place
right before the summit,

127
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,401
won't security during the actual event
be tightened even more?

128
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,941
What's wrong?

129
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,734
The footage right after the explosion...

130
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,026
What was on it?

131
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,567
It was just for a moment,

132
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,109
and I could be mistaken...

133
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,026
But that person...

134
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:11,276
...works at Café Poirot.

135
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,984
I remember his name,

136
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,734
as Amuro Tooru.

137
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,275
Amuro?!

138
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:22,858
(Police station)

139
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,441
From the forensics,

140
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:27,359
no explosives could be found at the scene.

141
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,983
The conference hall has a
Japanese restaurant on the first floor,

142
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,025
and the explosion took place in the basement,

143
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,858
where the kitchen is.

144
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,609
From there,
a huge amount of gas was detected.

145
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,691
I think it's safe to conclude that

146
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,983
the explosion was due to accumulated gas.

147
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,983
- Gas, huh?
- So it was an accident.

148
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:46,191
Wait. This building was constructed
only recently.

149
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,441
A gas leak is unlikely.

150
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:51,816
Yes, this gas pipe is the latest model,

151
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:55,276
and can be controlled remotely.

152
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,901
If so, why was there a gas leak?

153
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:02,733
Could the system be faulty from the start?

154
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,067
Weren't inspections carried out?

155
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,942
Inspections were scheduled for today.

156
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,191
What's going on?

157
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,025
The network connections in Edge of Ocean...

158
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,441
...were set up today.

159
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,900
And this morning,
inspections were scheduled to be done...

160
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,566
...right after security checks

161
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,316
by the Public Security Bureau
had been performed.

162
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:23,733
If that's the case,
then it's likely to be an accident.

163
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,941
Yes, if it's a terrorist attack
targeting the summit,

164
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:29,275
it's pointless
if not carried out with all the...

165
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:33,191
...important figures
from various countries gathered in the hall.

166
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,691
Regarding the summit,

167
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:36,900
due to this incident,

168
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,026
there will likely be a change in location.

169
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,317
It's likely to be an accident.

170
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,484
Reporting in!

171
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,525
State your name and jurisdiction.

172
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:49,109
Public Security Bureau, Kazami Yuuya.

173
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,608
About the ignition for the gas explosion...

174
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,775
We don't know yet.

175
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,691
We are still inspecting the electric works.

176
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,151
That ignition itself...

177
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,108
...could have been a high-voltage cable.

178
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,900
Did you find any construction fault?

179
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:05,150
No. However,

180
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,441
the casing for the high voltage cable...

181
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:10,151
...had a burnt fingerprint on it.

182
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:13,150
So, the fingerprint was from
before the explosion?

183
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:16,816
Yes, the only ones
who were on-site this morning,

184
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,692
were the construction workers
and Public Security Bureau personnel.

185
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,900
Therefore, we tried finding a match
for the fingerprint...

186
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,941
...from the workers'
and police officers' database...

187
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,067
...and found one,

188
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:28,900
from someone formerly

189
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,317
from the Criminal Investigation
1st Department:

190
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,109
Mouri Kogoro.

191
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,526
What?

192
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,359
How can that be?!

193
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:41,484
This can't be.

194
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,984
It's impossible...

195
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,400
(Detective Mouri Office)

196
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,691
The conference hall on reclaimed land?!

197
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,859
I've never even been there!

198
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:55,109
But we found your fingerprint at the scene.

199
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:56,859
That's nonsense!

200
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:03,608
Dad, could you have entered
while you were drunk?

201
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,859
Like I said, I've never been there!

202
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,983
It must be a misunderstanding!

203
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:11,067
Search all you want, you won't find a thing!

204
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,401
Excuse me.

205
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,234
Ah, yes.

206
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,025
Conan.

207
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,359
What's going on?

208
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,900
That police officer...

209
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,941
...has an injury on his face; is he alright?

210
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,901
Oh, you mean Kazami?

211
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:36,442
He was there when the explosion took place.

212
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,317
Oh! I need to use the toilet!

213
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,151
Right, what's up?

214
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,525
Your father is being suspected of a crime?

215
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:05,858
Yes. Well,
I believe it's a misunderstanding but...

216
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:08,734
Roger that, I'll investigate too.

217
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,567
Having a spare phone can be tough.

218
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,442
Huh? Where's my smartphone?

219
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,984
Professor?

220
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,941
Oh, Shinichi? What's going on?

221
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,109
I have a favour to ask.

222
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,650
How much longer will you take?!

223
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:38,859
Oh, sorry about it, but...

224
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,901
My smartphone...

225
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:58,776
Oh! This is fun!

226
00:13:58,901 --> 00:13:59,776
Genta!

227
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,191
Slow it down, please!

228
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:03,983
I'm doing a recording!

229
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,608
Sorry!

230
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,816
But this is amazing!

231
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,608
It can fly so far!

232
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,233
And it can be controlled

233
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,900
even at a 30-kilometre distance!

234
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,984
We made it fly 20 kilometres!

235
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,651
We even delivered something
to my grandmother in Saitama!

236
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,776
She was simply delighted!

237
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,608
Since when did you...

238
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:32,776
But isn't this monitor a little too small
to see clearly?

239
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:38,691
It wasn't designed for three-way usage.

240
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,941
Professor!
Add a monitor to my controller too.

241
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,567
Mine too!

242
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,858
Is that right...

243
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,359
Alright! Then let's have a quiz!

244
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:53,400
Okay? If you answer correctly,

245
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:56,192
I'll attach a monitor for everyone!

246
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,316
Here's the quiz!

247
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,233
(Professor Agasa Quiz)

248
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,066
Among the rows of hiragana characters,

249
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,816
which of these are of the largest scale?

250
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,275
1) Row "A".

251
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,650
2) Row "Ka".

252
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:10,150
3) Row "Sa".

253
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:11,358
4) Row "Ta".

254
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,858
What does "largest scale" means?

255
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:17,233
In other words,
which of these are the largest in size!

256
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:20,441
A large scale hiragana?

257
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,400
In row "A", there's a, i, u, e, and o.

258
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,275
Row "Ka" is ka, ki, ku, ke, and ko.

259
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:25,816
Think about what's in each row.

260
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,816
Sa, shi, su, se, so...

261
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,816
Ta, chi, tsu, te, to...

262
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,525
I have no idea!

263
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,900
Hey, Ayumi! Don't move the camera!

264
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,651
Oh, sorry.

265
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:39,650
1st hint: Swan.

266
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,983
Swan?

267
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:42,941
Hey, Ai!

268
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,025
If you think about a swan...

269
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,066
Swan Lake...

270
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,608
A big lake would be,

271
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,983
the "Mi" row!

272
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,441
Hmm? Not this row.

273
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:55,650
2nd hint: the swan will return.

274
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:58,275
The swan will return home?

275
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:01,191
Then it must be the lake!

276
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:05,026
Home... home...

277
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,066
I got it!

278
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,733
The unmanned probe, Swan,
will return from space!

279
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,276
So the answer is?

280
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,025
Number 1! The "A" row!

281
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:17,191
Within a, i, u, e and o,

282
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,441
"u" is the center (reads chuu),

283
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,441
and that forms "uchuu" (universe)!

284
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:23,567
The universe is larger in size
than anything else!

285
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,441
Indeed, that's perfect!

286
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,941
Hurray!

287
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:32,525
Aww, Ai! You always give them too many hints!

288
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,233
Hey Professor,

289
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,692
isn't it dangerous to have a quiz
while operating the drone?

290
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:40,275
And the recording they are doing right now

291
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:43,191
is not a game like your quiz!

292
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,192
I apologise.

293
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,566
Our detective department,

294
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,983
the Public Security Bureau
and the security department...

295
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:52,358
...were inspecting the location
before the summit,

296
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,817
and during the explosion,
the Public Security Bureau were in-charge.

297
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,567
That's why Officer Kazami was injured.

298
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:02,775
He was stationed outside the building
so his injuries are minor,

299
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,276
but those in the building...

300
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,067
It was mentioned on the news that
there were fatalities.

301
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,691
I shouldn't say something like this,
but I'm glad that...

302
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,608
...no civilians were harmed,

303
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,109
and the casualties
were police officers alone.

304
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,817
If the explosion happened during the summit,

305
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,775
it would cause a world-wide panic.

306
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,316
No, the Metropolitan Police Department...

307
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:31,025
...and the Public Security Bureau
in particular have been hit rather hard.

308
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:34,691
Then again, it can't be helped that
an explosion happened before the summit.

309
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:35,567
An accident?

310
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,441
Based on the primary evidence at the scene,

311
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:42,109
it appears to be an accident. But...

312
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:45,650
Uncle Kogoro's fingerprint was found
at the scene?

313
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:48,691
Yes. And because of that,

314
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,359
Kazami treats it like criminal case.

315
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,276
Officer Kazami...

316
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,650
Thank you, Officer Takagi.

317
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:58,359
Goodbye!

318
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,859
Get home safe!

319
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:03,983
Ran, what's wrong?

320
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,484
Shinichi! Help me!

321
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:08,816
They are going to arrest my dad!

322
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,151
Darn it!

323
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,734
I have no idea!

324
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,816
From your laptop in the drawer,

325
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,816
we found the schedule of the conference.

326
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:25,026
Also, the floorplan
of the exploded conference hall.

327
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:26,901
That's impossible!

328
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,816
My father can't possibly have such data
in his laptop!

329
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,941
That's right!

330
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,941
He's laptop illiterate!

331
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,691
That's right! I can't do that!

332
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:38,816
Anyway, we will discuss the details
at the station.

333
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,191
Don't mess around with me!

334
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:42,692
I won't go with you Public Security Officers
for interrogation!

335
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:47,816
Then we will arrest you on the spot
for obstruction of justice.

336
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,566
All I did was brush your hand away!

337
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:50,526
Hey!

338
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,109
No way!

339
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:53,942
This is impossible!

340
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:57,526
28th April, 4.56pm.

341
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,441
Hey! Let go of me!

342
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,566
If you struggle, you will only
increase suspicion against you.

343
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,109
- Let me go!
- Wait!

344
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,858
If the culprit was Uncle Kogoro,

345
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:11,150
then what was his motive
for causing the explosion?

346
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,108
That's right! What am I after?!

347
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,608
We will go into that
during the interrogation.

348
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:16,816
Hey, hold on!

349
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,109
Dad!

350
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,608
Calm down, Ran!

351
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:20,816
Contact Shinichi now!

352
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,359
I've already done that!

353
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,067
I called him, but...

354
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:29,525
Why, at such a crucial time...

355
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:32,359
Why isn't he here?!

356
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,734
This is a Public Security Bureau officer,
right?

357
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:03,234
Well, how should I know?

358
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,233
Wasn't Officer Kazami also injured?

359
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,609
And so are you.

360
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:11,984
So that means you were also
at the scene of the explosion?

361
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,775
I have no idea what you're talking about.

362
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,317
You were there for the inspection,
weren't you?

363
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,317
You found out there was potential
for a terrorist attack,

364
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:25,275
but at this rate,
they would just write it off as an accident.

365
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:28,067
And that's why you created a suspect!
Aren't I right?

366
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:33,067
It's highly likely
for officers like yourself...

367
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,858
...to work on your laptops at the scene,

368
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,526
and leave behind fingerprints in the process.

369
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,733
You know,

370
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,151
the police won't entertain anything
without evidence.

371
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,067
Why did you do such a thing?!

372
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:51,150
I have something I must protect

373
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,276
even at the expense of my life.

374
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:03,151
This time, Amuro might be an enemy.

375
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:06,859
Why?

376
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,859
Why won't you defend Dad?!

377
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:14,442
Do you really think he'd have done that?

378
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,692
He's not capable of such a thing.

379
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,901
So... why?!

380
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,775
Like you know, us lawyers...

381
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:24,026
...can't defend our own blood relatives.

382
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,566
It's very likely that the judge...

383
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,192
...may rule a lack of impartiality.

384
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,941
So, if I defend him,

385
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,859
we would only be at a disadvantage.

386
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,234
No way.

387
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:41,092
Don't worry,
I will find a good lawyer in no time.

388
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,396
(Contact an attorney for Dongdu University alumni)
(Beika Lawyers Association Directory)

389
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,316
What a shame.

390
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,483
It really turned out just as Furuya said.

391
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:50,400
But if we'd only found out earlier,

392
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:52,817
our colleagues wouldn't have had to die.

393
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:57,401
Who would expect an explosion
before the summit?

394
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:02,441
Right now,
we are investigating the list of...

395
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,276
...local extremist group
and international terrorists.

396
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,109
What about your side?

397
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:11,234
I'm looking into the connections made
with the gas line.

398
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:14,650
It seems to be using a rather unusual system.

399
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:15,692
What is it?

400
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:17,566
In due course of the investigation,

401
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,984
I'll convey that to the security department.

402
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:21,609
Roger that.

403
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:23,983
What about the thing I told you?

404
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:28,692
Yes. I've made preparations for "2291".

405
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,151
Furuya?

406
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:34,817
I got it.

407
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,317
That's...

408
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:44,026
As expected.

409
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:45,192
But...

410
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:51,025
In other words,
from within Mouri Kogoro's laptop,

411
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:55,108
was a record of connections made
to the gas line's switch.

412
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,525
Yes, that was reported
by the Cyber Crime Department.

413
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,942
It's confirmed now.

414
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,858
Mouri Kogoro sneaked in here, opened this,

415
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,191
and meddled with these high-voltage cables.

416
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,441
Hold on!

417
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:13,066
If so, the surveillance camera would
have caught him on its footage!

418
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:17,859
No, the internet connection was
only available from yesterday.

419
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,651
No way!

420
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,233
How's the interrogation?

421
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,900
He continues to deny everything,

422
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:27,358
but we can still press charges this way.

423
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,275
Do you intend to press charges
without finding a motive?!

424
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,567
If we get any evidence,
we will press charges.

425
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,984
Where the police is concerned,
it's a no-brainer, right?

426
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,066
Wait! Something is off!

427
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,650
Something is definitely strange!

428
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,650
What's off? And what's strange?

429
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,358
Do you think
we will deploy more investigators

430
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,484
just because of your opinion?

431
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,234
Is that so?

432
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,234
Yes.

433
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:56,858
No way!

434
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,441
Why wouldn't anyone defend Dad?!

435
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:00,901
Because it's a huge case?

436
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,941
That's right, and also...

437
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,567
The accused happens to be the
infamous "Sleeping Kogoro".

438
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,317
Any lawyer would hesitate to defend him.

439
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,442
Come in.

440
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:15,691
Excuse me.

441
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:16,567
Officer Hatori.

442
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:21,483
I think I need to let you know
before the news gets released.

443
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:22,109
What is it?

444
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:26,276
They... are going to
press charges against Mouri Kogoro.

445
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,733
There's enough evidence to
press charges against him?

446
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,817
The fingerprints found at the scene,

447
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:37,400
the floorplan and conference schedule
found in his laptop,

448
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,817
and the access log of the gas line.

449
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:43,691
Indeed, that's sufficient to prosecute.

450
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,817
Why? Dad...

451
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,192
Mum...

452
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,776
Wait for me, Ran.

453
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,901
I'll definitely save your dad!

454
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,650
Professor! Have you found something?

455
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,276
Oh, you're here.

456
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:07,859
Look at this.

457
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,276
Indeed.

458
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,401
That looks like explosives.

459
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,691
You asked me to do a video recording...

460
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:18,483
...of all the debris, right?

461
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,650
I've stitched up the video...

462
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,026
...like a puzzle and restored it.

463
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:28,025
In order to find out what kind of bomb it is,

464
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,775
Ai is on the internet as we speak,

465
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:32,317
trying to find a matching image.

466
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,316
Alright, I found it.

467
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:37,817
The explosives.

468
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:39,566
What is it?

469
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:40,942
I'll pull out the details.

470
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:48,358
An IoT pressure kettle?

471
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,734
It's like a pressure cooker
but in the form of a kettle.

472
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,108
Using a smartphone, one can adjust its...

473
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,858
...pressure, temperature and timer,

474
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:58,691
and easily whip up dishes like soups.

475
00:25:58,692 --> 00:25:59,817
Cooking?

476
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:02,026
Other than the pressure kettle,

477
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,858
there were other things like frying pans,

478
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,941
pots and utensils everywhere.

479
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,691
The explosion occurred inside the facility,

480
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,692
inside the kitchen of the restaurant.

481
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:13,026
What?

482
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:16,108
So it wasn't an explosive?!

483
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,026
Hey!

484
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,775
You asked me to search for the explosive,

485
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:23,692
and Ai worked hard for this too!

486
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,692
What's going on? This is unlike you.

487
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,067
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,901
What's the matter? What happened?

489
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:35,401
Uncle Kogoro...

490
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,234
...is going to be prosecuted!

491
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:48,401
Who's there?

492
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:49,942
What?

493
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,026
What did you say?

494
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,983
(Tachibana Kyoko, 29, lawyer)
So, please allow me, Tachibana Kyoko,

495
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:56,692
to defend "The Sleeping Kogoro"!

496
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:02,067
These are all the cases
I have handled before.

497
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,441
The Extremist Case of Nijoin University,

498
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:08,609
and the Spy Case of the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry...

499
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,359
You have done several cases
related to public security.

500
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:15,191
Then this current case
would be perfect for you.

501
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:18,275
And what were the outcomes of those cases?

502
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,151
What?

503
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,651
Little boy, you sound so grown up
for your age.

504
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,484
I lost them all.

505
00:27:27,692 --> 00:27:31,150
Oh,
but these public security cases are tough.

506
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,150
Indeed. As you are aware,

507
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,566
the rates for prosecutors winning the case
is above 90%.

508
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,067
And that's even higher
for public security cases such as these.

509
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,067
That means there's no way to win,

510
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:43,984
but I'm a "keiben", so...

511
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,359
Keiben?

512
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:46,900
In other words,

513
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:50,484
a freelance lawyer with no attachment
to law firms.

514
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:53,192
So I am obliged to take on cases
even if they are disadvantageous.

515
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,775
So that's why you'll defend my dad?

516
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,484
You need a lawyer, don't you?

517
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:00,901
I heard about it
from the lawyer's association,

518
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,484
so please let me do it!

519
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,441
That's right.

520
00:28:04,442 --> 00:28:06,901
Please wait!

521
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,442
No, we can't accept this, Mum.

522
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,316
That lawyer has no intention
of winning the case at all!

523
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,984
Indeed.

524
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,983
But looking at it differently,

525
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,108
because she's hopeless as a lawyer,

526
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:19,275
the prosecution may underestimate her.

527
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,275
But that's no winning strategy!

528
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,941
It's probably better
to get a court-appointed lawyer.

529
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:26,109
Then I won't be able to interfere.

530
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,192
But if she's involved,
I can give my two cents.

531
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:33,067
Even so...

532
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,816
- I feel really uneasy.
- What is the cat's name?

533
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:36,817
It's Goro!

534
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,733
It looks like you'll be denying...

535
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:46,359
(Makoto Kusakabe, 40, Attorney)
...everything to the police.

536
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:50,400
That goes without saying.
I didn't do anything.

537
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,816
But there is so much evidence

538
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,525
pointing to you as the culprit.

539
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,108
It beats me too!

540
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,901
I can only imagine,
that someone is trying to set me up!

541
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,525
This explosion case will be handled...

542
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,401
...by Prosecutor Kusakabe.

543
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:10,191
That sounds like bad news.

544
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:12,108
I've heard of him,

545
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:15,192
in spite of the little experience
I have with public security cases.

546
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,734
Is he that good a prosecutor?

547
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:22,567
He's as good as Attorney Kisaki.

548
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,859
And unlike me, he has never lost before.

549
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:31,025
I'm familiar with this case.

550
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,941
Unauthorised access into NAZU's system.

551
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:38,234
You mean that well-known,
American space research centre?

552
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,441
Yes. Last year, some game company's staff

553
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:43,151
decided to access their system for fun.

554
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,691
The prosecutor for that case
was also Kusakabe.

555
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,109
And, the outcome was...

556
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:51,109
Of course, he won that too.

557
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:52,942
"Of course", huh?

558
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,901
Good grief.

559
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:03,192
As a result of today's investigation...

560
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:05,608
It bothers me that Mouri Kogoro has no motive

561
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,401
to carry out this terror attack.

562
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,901
(Iwai Sayoko, 40)
Motive, you say.

563
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:17,276
But with already this much evidence,

564
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,651
can't we just press charges tomorrow?

565
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,776
Well...

566
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:24,191
For example, if the gas line from the scene

567
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:27,109
was accessed and recorded in this log,

568
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,650
using the suspect's laptop
as an access point,

569
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:32,109
then it would make logical sense.

570
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:34,733
On top of that, by leaving the floorplan

571
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:37,191
and schedule in the laptop as evidence,

572
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:40,401
- Mouri Kogoro could be a scapegoat.
- Chief Kusakabe...

573
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,192
That is...

574
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,525
...mere presumption on your part,

575
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,817
disregarding all the evidence too.

576
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:51,483
Iwai, I made the police
carry out extra investigations,

577
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:54,109
Prosecute Mouri Kogoro.

578
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,483
That's the public security department's
decision.

579
00:30:58,484 --> 00:30:59,234
Understood?

580
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:03,401
Does that public security department...

581
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,734
...belong to the prosecutor's office,
or to the police?

582
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,983
That will be all.

583
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:12,484
Please leave.

584
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,942
You were asked
to carry out extra investigations?

585
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,359
Yes, by Prosecutor Kusakabe.

586
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:32,733
So, based on the result of
this investigation,

587
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,567
they may not press charges against my dad?

588
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:36,025
No.

589
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,983
Although Kusakabe requested
for extra investigations,

590
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,566
the Public Security Bureau has
already decided to press charges.

591
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,317
Hold on!

592
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,026
Why would the decision to press charges
come from the police?

593
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,441
The police themselves...

594
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,566
...are in no position to interfere
with the prosecution!

595
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,525
No matter what,
that right alone is exclusive...

596
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:52,317
...to the prosecution!

597
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,026
Yes, it is as you said.

598
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,441
However, it applies for
prosecuting civil and criminal cases,

599
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:01,817
as well as special investigations cases.

600
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:06,400
But when it comes to
the public security department,

601
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,484
you should know
it would be a little different.

602
00:32:10,317 --> 00:32:11,734
Yes.

603
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,567
Even if we call it
the public security department,

604
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,400
there is one of each in the
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,

605
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,276
the National Police Agency
and the Public Prosecutors' Office.

606
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:23,483
Although the police hands all investigation
outcome to the prosecutors,

607
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:27,442
the prosecutors may also investigate it.

608
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,816
The prosecutor's decision to...

609
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:33,191
press charges against the suspect or not,

610
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:36,109
would normally be based on
this investigation.

611
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,317
However, the public security department of
the prosecutors' office is different.

612
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:43,566
To put it simply,

613
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,526
one can't fight against the
police's public security department...

614
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,775
...due to the disparity
in the number of members

615
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,317
as well as their skills.

616
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,276
Therefore, there are times

617
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:58,067
where the "concern of public security"
can come into place.

618
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,859
Concern of public security?

619
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:04,858
For an explosion to take place
at the summit's location,

620
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,151
is a great humiliation
to the Public Security Bureau.

621
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,942
I can imagine their pressure
to press charges.

622
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,442
Then dad would be...

623
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:19,192
Yes, they will definitely press charges.

624
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,192
No...

625
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,608
This lawyer...

626
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,151
It's as if she's on the prosecution's side!

627
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,775
Kogoro's laptop...

628
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,776
Did you check the possibility of it
being manipulated by someone else?

629
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:42,442
Well, Kusakabe did request
for additional investigations.

630
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,109
Please tell me all you can!

631
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,191
I really want to help Uncle Kogoro!

632
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:51,775
Any sort of information will do!

633
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:53,691
Mr. Mouri...

634
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:55,067
What happened to him?

635
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:56,567
Amuro...

636
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:59,150
You overheard us?

637
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,276
What is it?

638
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,858
I was worried about Mr. Mouri,

639
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,442
so I brought some snacks from Café Poirot.

640
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,026
Mouri is no longer here.

641
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,066
He is now awaiting prosecution...

642
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,692
...under police custody.

643
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:16,733
There's no way you wouldn't know, right?

644
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:21,691
I see. You are still as sharp as ever.

645
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,066
Hey, you're not allowed to bring him...

646
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,401
...such items while he's being detained.

647
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,692
Understood!

648
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,484
What is he after?!

649
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:39,026
2991, submission complete.

650
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:42,942
What? What did he say to Amuro?

651
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:44,692
Darn!

652
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,733
Hey! Officer!

653
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:50,401
Return the laptop
you took from Uncle's house!

654
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:53,775
It has my favourite game in it!

655
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:55,816
Like I said before!

656
00:34:55,817 --> 00:34:57,608
It's part of the evidence
so we can't return it yet.

657
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,400
Hey, Conan! Stop this!

658
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:05,192
Professor made that game for me!

659
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,567
Conan, I called you a few times.

660
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,192
What?

661
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,276
My battery is flat.

662
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:24,609
Can you charge it with that?

663
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:26,651
Yes. Thank you!

664
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,651
Normally, it would have lasted longer.

665
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,608
Why did you call?

666
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,150
They will be bringing information
of the case soon.

667
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,651
Ran said she wanted to show you too.

668
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:46,233
Because Conan always finds
interesting angles.

669
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:50,901
And you might be able to tell Shinichi
about it too.

670
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,359
Yes! I will let him know for sure!

671
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,317
Thank you, Conan.

672
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,109
Sorry to keep you waiting.

673
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,192
These are the evidence
the prosecutors submitted.

674
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,609
So, that means...

675
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,692
...they have decided to press charges?

676
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:09,816
The prosecutor's side has decided...

677
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,067
...to press charges as soon as possible.

678
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:14,484
Dad...

679
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:18,692
Don't worry, we'll definitely save him.

680
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:20,026
Let's go over there.

681
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:20,692
Yes.

682
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,276
Record of statement,
the crime scene appraisal,

683
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,651
and crime scene photographs.

684
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,317
That's a lot.

685
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,692
I've got to find something.

686
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,776
Darn it, there's nothing?!

687
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,151
What's wrong?

688
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:47,151
No...

689
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:48,692
It feels like I've seen this somewhere.

690
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:50,983
Looking at these,

691
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:53,484
it clearly shows
the method for the explosion.

692
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,275
The police investigation reports,

693
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:59,067
are like a written manual of the crime.

694
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,234
Manual...

695
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:08,609
Yes, this is Tachibana.

696
00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:10,317
The court?

697
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,234
Yes.

698
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:15,609
Pre-trial arrangement procedure...

699
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:19,400
Iwai!

700
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:20,900
Why did you tell the defence...

701
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:24,109
...about the prosecution,
without even telling me?!

702
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,734
Stop making me repeat myself.

703
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:29,233
That's the public security police's decision.

704
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:31,025
So they decided on the prosecution,

705
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:33,734
and now the timing?

706
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:36,025
On top of that,

707
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,150
the court has already
contacted the prosecuting side,

708
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:41,066
as well as the defence, to complete the...

709
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,359
...pre-trial arrangement procedure tomorrow.

710
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:47,567
So why was this information conveyed to you?!

711
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,859
I'm the prosecutor in-charge!

712
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:54,317
You will be notified
once the formalities are done.

713
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,608
It's not here, that huge tub of ice cream...

714
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:01,984
Indeed.

715
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:06,025
I'll go ask the staff,

716
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:08,901
and you get the flour and eggs!

717
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:12,984
You'd make a great wife, Azusa.

718
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,109
Please be mindful of your behaviour!

719
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,566
You're so popular
with the regular high school girls.

720
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,066
Our last conversation went viral
on the internet!

721
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,150
In this day and age,

722
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:28,234
one never knows
when someone else might be listening!

723
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:30,901
Indeed.

724
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:38,692
Furuya.

725
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:43,151
Why are you bent on trying to make it a case?

726
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:45,650
If it's treated as an accident,

727
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:47,733
we will lose one warrant.

728
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,358
But as public security officers,

729
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,067
we can conduct investigations
without warrant.

730
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:56,609
All the more we have to do it legally.

731
00:38:57,526 --> 00:38:59,734
We will be suffocating ourselves.

732
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:02,858
We are obligated to take care of...

733
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:04,151
...any illegal activities on our parts.

734
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,775
That's public security.

735
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:10,066
But the decision
to announce a case legally...

736
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,275
...or to conceal it legally,

737
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,067
that's also on us.

738
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,151
Of course.

739
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:20,609
It is based on whichever decision...

740
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,817
...can protect Japan the most.

741
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,901
Hey, Amuro!

742
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,316
(Tokyo District Court)

743
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:32,358
So, first of all...

744
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:33,400
From the prosecution's side,

745
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:36,316
please clear the facts to be proven,

746
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:38,026
and provide the evidence.

747
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,109
Yes.

748
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,776
We will submit a list of evidence.

749
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:45,984
Ran.

750
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,984
Calm down.

751
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,484
But...

752
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,109
The trial is not today, is it?

753
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,650
That's right.

754
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,067
This is the pre-trial procedure.

755
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:59,275
Its purpose is to arrange all the points
of debate and evidence,

756
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:01,108
and also to decide on a trial date.

757
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,483
Didn't I mention that?

758
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,276
I know, but...

759
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,234
Ms. Kyoko!

760
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,650
Iwai, this is Kusakabe.

761
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,484
Right now,

762
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,109
we have completed the
pre-trial arrangement procedure.

763
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:27,941
The evidence that Kusakabe submitted...

764
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:31,192
It was the same as what was submitted before.

765
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,651
This is the list.

766
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,108
The trial date?

767
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:37,441
It's decided.

768
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:39,609
Just as planned before.

769
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,858
Sorry, please read through it.

770
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,484
I need to use the washroom.

771
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,358
Oh, Ms. Kyoko!

772
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,484
It's the other way!

773
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:50,692
Ms. Kyoko!

774
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:56,442
- This is...
- How's the situation?

775
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,359
The bug I placed on Kazami yesterday...

776
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,609
Is he nearby?

777
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:04,150
I see, please carry on.

778
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,026
He's nearby!

779
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:08,692
Could he be...

780
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,234
...in this court?!

781
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,442
Where?!

782
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:22,191
Isn't this Kyoko's ringtone?!

783
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:23,941
Hello, Kyoko?

784
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,026
I have something to confirm with you.

785
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,484
I'll be right back!

786
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:31,941
Why would I be hearing Kyoko's voice...

787
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:33,651
...through the bug on Kazami?!

788
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,901
Could she just happen to be near Kazami?

789
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,067
No. If I could hear her voice,

790
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:44,192
they should be rather close.

791
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,901
It can't be a coincidence.

792
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,525
According to our investigation in PSB,

793
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:58,941
the unauthorised access to the crime scene...

794
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:01,317
...was carried out using "NOR".

795
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:02,901
NOR?

796
00:42:03,192 --> 00:42:05,483
It is a browser software...

797
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,941
...encrypting an IP address,

798
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,941
that bypasses a few computers,

799
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,776
thus making it untraceable.

800
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:14,401
Can you crack the anonymity of NOR?

801
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:16,609
Technically, I can't.

802
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:20,150
But if there are any flaws or bugs...

803
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,733
...in the NOR software,
it will be possible...

804
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:24,609
...to pinpoint its user.

805
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,358
So that means,

806
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,483
if we can weaken the culprit's NOR software,

807
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,484
we can possibly trace its user.

808
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,691
Right now, we are trying to trace the server,

809
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:38,400
while searching for the possibility...

810
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:40,692
...of tracking down the user.

811
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:42,692
My apologies.

812
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:46,526
I've been summoned.

813
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,317
I'll excuse myself.

814
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:49,442
Okay.

815
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,442
Are you trying to eavesdrop on the meeting?

816
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,651
Why are you here?

817
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,441
As long as it's related to Mouri Kogoro,

818
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:03,734
you'll give it all you've got.

819
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:05,233
Or, is it...

820
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:07,442
...for Ran's sake?

821
00:43:10,192 --> 00:43:11,442
It's fine. Come on out.

822
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:16,567
Why did you call me out?

823
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:19,276
Furuya?

824
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:37,233
I would have expected more
of a Public Security Officer.

825
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:39,484
I-I'm sorry.

826
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,567
Who did this?

827
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:48,442
Wait!

828
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:56,567
This bug...

829
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,026
Was it set by you?

830
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:01,984
No way.

831
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:03,942
He's only a child...

832
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:05,608
The organisation that Amuro is from,

833
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:09,108
which can control the entire nation's
public security officers...

834
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:10,109
...is nicknamed "Zero".

835
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,441
Only a handful of public security officers...

836
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:19,734
...are able to receive his direct orders.

837
00:44:20,442 --> 00:44:22,359
And one of them is you, Officer Kazami.

838
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:26,817
Who exactly are you?

839
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:29,526
Edogawa Conan,

840
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,151
a detective.

841
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:47,234
The man you address as Amuro,

842
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:50,192
is a murderer.

843
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:00,525
Last year,
the suspect we brought in for interrogation

844
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:01,817
was driven to commit suicide.

845
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:03,859
Suicide?

846
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:09,442
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that to a child.

847
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,817
Why did I say those things
to a child like you?

848
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:16,942
It's not your problem.

849
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:20,858
So, before the PSB...

850
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:22,691
...can pinpoint the accessing address,

851
00:45:22,692 --> 00:45:24,567
they got Mouri Kogoro.

852
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,275
Excuse me!

853
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:27,067
Right now...

854
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:28,317
The city is in trouble!

855
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:40,651
W-What's this?!

856
00:45:44,984 --> 00:45:47,191
Mum! Something's wrong!

857
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,192
No way!

858
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:52,816
What?!

859
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:54,484
- Is something wrong?!
- Hurry up!

860
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:57,359
- Whoa, this is bad indeed.
- Whoa! Amazing, what is this?!

861
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,192
It's always the same thing.

862
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:05,816
For today's summit, tight security
has been stationed all across Tokyo.

863
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:08,400
Currently, the police have yet
to release a statement...

864
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:14,151
...regarding the numerous strange occurences
in the city.

865
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,566
Not only in Japan, members of the summit...

866
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,817
...are voicing their complaints
to the Japanese government.

867
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,733
Personal computers and electric kettles
have been reported to have exploded.

868
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,234
And panic continues to spread.

869
00:46:28,276 --> 00:46:29,776
What exactly is this?!

870
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,192
I repeat.

871
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:34,066
Currently, the police have yet to release...

872
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:36,191
- What is the culprit trying to do?
- a statement regarding the numerous strange occurences.

873
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:37,858
of electrical appliances exploding.

874
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,192
- Strange occurence of exploding...
- Electrical appliances?

875
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:43,733
Using a smartphone, one can adjust its...

876
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,734
..pressure, temperature and timer,
and easily whip up dishes like soups.

877
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:49,734
That's it!

878
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:51,650
This terrorist attack,

879
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:53,609
started with the explosion
at the conference hall!

880
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:02,025
Situation report!

881
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:04,151
The communications headquarters
is also in a state of panic!

882
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:06,900
Over 100 locations have reported in!

883
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:08,650
The headquarters should be
in the police department!

884
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,026
What's going on?!

885
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:12,566
Is this a terrorist attack?

886
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,526
Where are the official statements?!

887
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:18,650
Conan, sorry I haven't time
to speak with you now.

888
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:22,942
Inspector Megure!
All this must be an "IoT terrorist attack"!

889
00:47:23,776 --> 00:47:25,608
IoT terrorist attack?

890
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,525
What the culprit is trying to do,

891
00:47:27,526 --> 00:47:29,191
is make random IoT appliances...

892
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:30,484
...go berserk via the internet!

893
00:47:32,234 --> 00:47:34,525
So if you cut off the internet connection,

894
00:47:34,526 --> 00:47:35,859
the chaos would stop!

895
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:41,567
An IoT terrorist attack huh?

896
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:46,026
What a child.

897
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:49,691
So that pressure kettle...

898
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,275
...from the crime scene,

899
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:53,401
should also be an IoT appliance!

900
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:58,025
So, using the internet,
the culprit manipulated the IoT gas line...

901
00:47:58,026 --> 00:48:00,401
...to fill the place with gas,

902
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:03,441
then turned the IoT kettle
into an ignition source,

903
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:05,567
and caused the explosion
in the conference hall!

904
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,566
S-So that means...

905
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:11,317
Yes!

906
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:13,901
It wasn't Uncle Kogoro!

907
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:15,526
Is that true?

908
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,900
That's what big brother Shinichi told me,

909
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,484
so I'll leave it to you!

910
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:26,859
Conan.

911
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:31,067
So Shinichi really worked hard...

912
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:32,859
...for my dad's sake.

913
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:39,942
Silly.

914
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,691
It wasn't...

915
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:43,401
...just for your dad.

916
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:45,984
I see.

917
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:47,733
If all that is true,

918
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:50,026
then we can probably win the case.

919
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:53,441
Yes, because Uncle Kogoro
is now under police custody,

920
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,651
and can't access the internet!

921
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:57,276
No.

922
00:48:57,651 --> 00:49:00,275
If he set the timer beforehand,

923
00:49:00,276 --> 00:49:01,900
he could still carry out the IoT attacks...

924
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:03,526
...even after being arrested.

925
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,066
If they trace the server...

926
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:08,733
...and pinpoint the access point,

927
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:11,150
Mouri would definitely be charged.

928
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:12,484
No way!

929
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:17,191
But isn't the server investigation difficult?

930
00:49:17,192 --> 00:49:19,650
Would it be done in time for the trial?

931
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:23,192
If the PSB are on it,
it shouldn't be that tough.

932
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:24,484
Wait.

933
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:28,192
Why are you so familiar with the process?

934
00:49:31,526 --> 00:49:33,276
Oh, I'm so sorry!

935
00:49:35,192 --> 00:49:36,526
Well, little boy...

936
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:40,651
They often perform such an investigation.

937
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:45,608
The PSB has many "cooperators", after all.

938
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:50,192
Do you mean civilians
who help with their investigation?

939
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:51,567
That's right.

940
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,691
In particular, investigations involving...

941
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:54,900
...server related issues...

942
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,776
...under the wiretapping law.

943
00:49:57,151 --> 00:49:59,776
The PSB has many cooperators.

944
00:50:00,526 --> 00:50:02,608
With such a cooperator,

945
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,316
they can soon find evidence...

946
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,358
...of Mouri Kogoro's unauthorised access.

947
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:10,276
Well, provided such evidence exists,
of course.

948
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:13,525
Right, this will do.

949
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:14,650
Do you think so?

950
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,525
Yes. Let us ask the companies directly.

951
00:50:17,526 --> 00:50:20,651
I knew it, something felt strange.

952
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,317
She is hiding something.

953
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:26,775
Regarding the numerous strange occurences
in the city,

954
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:28,816
the MPD just released a statement...

955
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:32,234
...that it could likely be
an IoT terrorist attack.

956
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:36,151
Who would have expected
an IoT terrorist attack?

957
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,192
All the same, you even managed
to pinpoint the method used.

958
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:44,066
I wasn't the one who found it out,

959
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,442
but thanks to that, I could make it a case.

960
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,066
And so, I would like to settle...

961
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:51,067
the illegal deeds I had performed.

962
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:53,526
Release the cooperator.

963
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,191
Before that, please tell me...

964
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,067
...what information Zero has at this point.

965
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:09,776
NAZU?

966
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,900
Release this information...

967
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:13,359
...to the anti-cybercrime department,

968
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:16,151
and let the investigation team report this
in their meetings.

969
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:19,359
You want the investigation team
to take credit for this?

970
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,192
It should be reported by us, the PSB.

971
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:25,609
It's a reward.

972
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,566
It is to their credit, that...

973
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,484
...we were able to turn
the explosion into a criminal case.

974
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:30,817
Also,

975
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:33,401
the higher ups are aware that...

976
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:36,026
...this information came from Zero.

977
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:39,776
You're scary.

978
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,733
Kazami. Above me, are two people...

979
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,692
...way scarier than I am.

980
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,026
And one of them,

981
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,651
is still a child.

982
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:57,567
I just thought of the same kid as you.

983
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:05,941
We have found...

984
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:09,692
...traces of unauthorised access
from Mouri's laptop.

985
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:12,692
As speculated,
it was used as an access point.

986
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,109
And the trace itself?

987
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:21,400
From a public wifi,
using an untraceable smartphone.

988
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:22,859
So we couldn't pinpoint it.

989
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,358
But at that point of time,

990
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:27,316
(Tokyo Detention Center)
Mouri was detained under police custody,

991
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:30,192
so it was impossible for him
to be an access point.

992
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:34,692
And like before, the current IoT attacks...

993
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:39,151
...were also accessed via the NOR software.

994
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,483
So it's the same culprit.

995
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:45,192
How is the investigation
in locating the server?

996
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:49,441
According to the report
from the anti-cybercrime department,

997
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:52,734
the system was found in NAZU.

998
00:53:00,526 --> 00:53:02,316
Hello! Sorry I'm late!

999
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:03,566
Kuriyama,

1000
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:06,400
I'm sorry about this.
You rarely have a vacation, and yet...

1001
00:53:06,401 --> 00:53:07,608
No, it's fine!

1002
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:10,191
You have an important matter at hand
and as your staff,

1003
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:12,401
how could I be out gallivanting?

1004
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,026
Thanks for your help.

1005
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,359
So...

1006
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,526
Here's the investigation on Tachibana Kyoko.

1007
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:23,776
Hmm? Kudo Shinichi asked me to do it.

1008
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:26,025
Shinichi did?

1009
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:29,817
Huh? Big brother Shinichi ordered that?

1010
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:33,442
Why would he want to investigate Tachibana?

1011
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:37,941
If big brother Shinichi wanted it,

1012
00:53:37,942 --> 00:53:40,067
he definitely has a good reason.

1013
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:42,067
Shall we look at the report?

1014
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:45,816
We found out that Tachibana's staff...

1015
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:48,442
...broke the law last year.

1016
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,234
Isn't Tachibana a freelance lawyer?

1017
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:54,734
She shut down her firm last year.

1018
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:59,483
At that time, her staff, Haba Fumikazu...

1019
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:02,983
...illegally accessed and stole...

1020
00:54:02,984 --> 00:54:04,276
...from a game company.

1021
00:54:05,234 --> 00:54:07,650
But after Haba was arrested
for investigation,

1022
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:09,901
he commited suicide
while under police custody.

1023
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:12,734
What? Suicide?

1024
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,692
Suicide...

1025
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:20,317
(Investigation Report)
What's going on?

1026
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:23,316
A third party...

1027
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:26,317
...was manipulating Mouri Kogoro's laptop,

1028
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:30,109
therefore it's unlikely that
he's the culprit.

1029
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:31,901
Yes!

1030
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:33,567
And that's it.

1031
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:36,401
So what about the fingerprint?

1032
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,859
That burnt fingerprint, you mean?

1033
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:43,651
It's really easy
to transplant something like that.

1034
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:47,942
Is that the PSB's conclusion?

1035
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:50,484
They will not prosecute Mouri Kogoro.

1036
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:52,900
So the decision not to prosecute...

1037
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:54,941
...will be based on the PSB's words?!

1038
00:54:54,942 --> 00:54:56,984
You're so stubborn.

1039
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:18,191
What? Iwai?

1040
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:19,192
Yes.

1041
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,858
She suffered minor burns,

1042
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,692
but went to the hospital just in case.

1043
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:25,901
Could that
have been an IoT terror attack too?

1044
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,525
We checked the smartphone,

1045
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,025
and it's the same as before:

1046
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,026
an access from the NOR software.

1047
00:55:33,234 --> 00:55:34,317
Excuse me.

1048
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:35,859
Yes, this is Shiratori.

1049
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:39,817
What? Hold on!

1050
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:43,067
They are not going to prosecute Mouri!

1051
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:47,401
Mum!

1052
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:52,192
That's great, Ran.

1053
00:55:52,734 --> 00:55:54,651
Yes, thank you.

1054
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:57,108
I need to tell Shinichi,

1055
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:58,609
and Sonoko too!

1056
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:02,401
Anyway, what should we do?

1057
00:56:03,317 --> 00:56:05,275
This is from the investigator...

1058
00:56:05,276 --> 00:56:07,526
...in charge of Haba Fumikazu's case.

1059
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:11,858
Isn't this person the victim...

1060
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:13,108
...from the smartphone that got set ablaze?

1061
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:15,067
She was the prosecutor in-charge.

1062
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:18,358
But right now, she's Kusakabe's superior,

1063
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:21,150
who was from the same year as her.

1064
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,317
That's right.

1065
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:25,650
Iwai was promoted...

1066
00:56:25,651 --> 00:56:28,651
...thanks to Haba Fumikazu's case.

1067
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,442
By the way, what is this?

1068
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:35,483
Why are you investigating...

1069
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:36,817
...me and my former staff?

1070
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:38,733
Well...

1071
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:41,025
I'm sorry, we wanted to know...

1072
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:44,317
...more about you,
so I asked Kuriyama to do it.

1073
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,691
You did a good job investigating.

1074
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:51,817
You'd make a great employee too.

1075
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,734
"You... too?"

1076
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:55,733
You speak as though...

1077
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:57,567
...Haba Fumikazu was also a great employee.

1078
00:56:57,776 --> 00:57:00,441
Wasn't he a bad employee who stole,

1079
00:57:00,442 --> 00:57:02,525
and caused your firm to shut down?

1080
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:04,484
A bad employee?

1081
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,151
That wasn't Fumikazu's fault!

1082
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:12,401
It was my fault for being so helpless...

1083
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:15,859
He was a mere employee,

1084
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:21,276
but you addressed him by his first name.

1085
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,526
What about his suicide
in the detention centre?

1086
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:32,984
He commited suicide,

1087
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,817
soon after facing interrogation
by the public security officer...

1088
00:57:37,942 --> 00:57:39,067
...at the detention centre.

1089
00:57:41,317 --> 00:57:43,275
Last year, he drove a suspect...

1090
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:46,026
...to commit suicide at the detention centre.

1091
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:49,108
Why would a public security officer....

1092
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:51,483
I've never heard of that.

1093
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:56,067
When Fumikazu commited suicide,
something strange happened.

1094
00:57:56,442 --> 00:57:58,900
This Haba Fumikazu was dismissed

1095
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:01,941
as a legal apprentice, right?

1096
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:04,566
So his ambition was to be a judge?

1097
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:06,400
Yes, but...

1098
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:09,316
During the judicial ceremony,

1099
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:10,441
he...

1100
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:12,401
(4 years ago, Law Training Institute)

1101
00:58:12,984 --> 00:58:15,608
To those who would from this day,

1102
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:17,275
become a judge or a lawyer...

1103
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:18,942
- Your connections made here...
- Director!

1104
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:20,483
Director!

1105
00:58:20,484 --> 00:58:21,816
About...

1106
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:23,358
About my rejection,

1107
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,941
I would like an explanation!

1108
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:26,191
What is the meaning of this?

1109
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:29,608
The reason behind my rejection...

1110
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:30,816
The reason!

1111
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:34,191
How could you, with no reason...

1112
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:35,900
You took away my mission...

1113
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:37,066
...to be a judge!

1114
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:38,233
I won't forgive this!

1115
00:58:38,234 --> 00:58:39,234
I won't forgive this!

1116
00:58:39,235 --> 00:58:41,067
I won't forgive this!

1117
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:44,150
That action...

1118
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:46,775
...was deemed as self-fulfilling,

1119
00:58:46,776 --> 00:58:49,526
self-righteous behaviour and as a result...

1120
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:52,358
His path as a lawyer was destroyed,

1121
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:54,401
and so was his future in the legal world.

1122
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:57,276
Why did you take Haba as your staff?

1123
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:02,567
You see, people have two sides to them.

1124
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,442
What people could see,
was only one side of him.

1125
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:14,691
I heard from your daughter outside,

1126
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:16,941
that if they are not prosecuting
Mouri Kogoro,

1127
00:59:16,942 --> 00:59:18,900
then my business here is finished.

1128
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:20,692
What? Ah, yes.

1129
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:27,525
Then, please excuse me too.

1130
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,401
There are still investigations pending.

1131
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:31,900
You have to investigate the culprit's NOR,
right?

1132
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,608
Yes, we have requested help from NAZU.

1133
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:37,567
NAZU? The American organisation?

1134
00:59:37,984 --> 00:59:41,275
Yes. Last year,
they had an unauthorised access...

1135
00:59:41,276 --> 00:59:43,109
...made via NOR.

1136
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:46,484
Ah, the case Ms. Kyoko worked on.

1137
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,900
Because of that, NAZU completed a system...

1138
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:50,691
...capable of tracing NOR users,

1139
00:59:50,692 --> 00:59:54,984
and they will help us trace it from tomorrow.

1140
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:57,525
They are tied up with the task...

1141
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,233
...on Swan's landing mission, after all.

1142
01:00:00,234 --> 01:00:02,984
You mean, the unmanned probe?

1143
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:05,900
Yes, it happens on the same day
as the summit,

1144
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:08,025
so the police are all frantic.

1145
01:00:08,026 --> 01:00:11,359
I see, so the summit is today as well.

1146
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:17,901
At the time of the explosion,
the Public Security Bureau were in charge.

1147
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,650
The prosecutor's public security department

1148
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:23,567
doesn't stand a chance against
the police's public security department.

1149
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:25,941
Therefore, there are times

1150
01:00:25,942 --> 01:00:28,692
where the "concern of public security"
can come into place.

1151
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:33,192
The PSB has many cooperators.

1152
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,317
Isn't this Kyoko's ringtone?

1153
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:39,692
Why am I hearing it through the bug
on Kazami?

1154
01:00:40,067 --> 01:00:42,691
The man you call Amuro,

1155
01:00:42,692 --> 01:00:44,192
is a murderer.

1156
01:00:45,026 --> 01:00:49,317
He commited suicide
while under police custody.

1157
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:54,941
I know about this case.

1158
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,566
Unauthorised access into NAZU's system.

1159
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:57,858
An IoT terrorist attack?

1160
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:01,276
Making IoT appliances
go berserk via the internet!

1161
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:03,650
The police investigation reports,

1162
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,483
are like a written manual of the crime.

1163
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:09,151
I found a matching image!

1164
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:11,609
It feels as if I've seen this somewhere.

1165
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:16,151
No way. It can't be...

1166
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:18,817
Midori!

1167
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:20,775
Send me the details...

1168
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,526
...on the unauthorised access
into NAZU's system!

1169
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:25,901
That's what Shinichi said to tell you!

1170
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:30,151
Conan!

1171
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:31,941
We're going to pick my dad up...

1172
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:34,067
...from the police department!

1173
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:38,984
Darn it, why won't Shinichi answer his phone?

1174
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:05,483
It looks like you expected me to come here.

1175
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:08,567
The first time I felt something was off,
was back then.

1176
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,775
Excuse me.

1177
01:02:15,776 --> 01:02:16,817
Ah, yes.

1178
01:02:23,317 --> 01:02:25,441
I got Professor to help me investigate...

1179
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:27,692
...and there was a tracing app in it,

1180
01:02:27,942 --> 01:02:30,067
the sort that doesn't leave any icon.

1181
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:32,734
What about the evidence left by the PSB?

1182
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:35,483
None, as expected of the PSB.

1183
01:02:35,484 --> 01:02:37,108
Since you already knew that,

1184
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:39,026
why didn't you remove the app?

1185
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:41,400
Because I'm going to meet the culprit now.

1186
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:43,566
You know the culprit
behind the terror attacks?!

1187
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,776
Yes, and their target too.

1188
01:02:46,234 --> 01:02:50,817
The target, is you and your team, Amuro.

1189
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:56,441
The root was the unauthorised access
into NAZU.

1190
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,234
That was last year's...

1191
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,025
Haba Fumikazu?!

1192
01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:01,776
Yes.

1193
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:06,066
Last year, Haba commited suicide
in the detention centre, didn't he?

1194
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:09,442
Yes. It was on this same day last year.

1195
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,484
This very day... last year?!

1196
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:15,776
I see. How awful.

1197
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:19,151
The culprit has yet to
finish getting revenge!

1198
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:38,817
IoT terrorist attack?!

1199
01:04:11,817 --> 01:04:12,776
Amuro!

1200
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:20,567
Go!

1201
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:29,483
At last, the unmanned probe, Swan,

1202
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:31,442
has returned to Earth from Mars.

1203
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:33,191
Good evening, everyone.

1204
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:36,026
This is the Nagano Astrology Channel.

1205
01:04:36,984 --> 01:04:39,108
Right now,
we have observed the Swan's location...

1206
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,650
It's already so late, time to go home.

1207
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:45,525
But the Swan will return soon!

1208
01:04:45,526 --> 01:04:48,900
Let us watch the live broadcast!

1209
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:51,150
No, watch it at home.

1210
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:54,151
No way! Haibara...

1211
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:58,734
Yes. What's up?

1212
01:04:59,776 --> 01:05:04,400
The children want to
watch the live broadcast.

1213
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,484
Time left until it enters the atmosphere?

1214
01:05:08,026 --> 01:05:09,858
I think it's...

1215
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:11,026
Kudo?

1216
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,025
Another hour or less?

1217
01:05:14,026 --> 01:05:15,276
We have no time!

1218
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,859
Conan, so the culprit...

1219
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:20,400
Yes. The culprit is attempting to...

1220
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:21,816
...hack into NAZU and make it crash!

1221
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,483
But, where....?

1222
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,942
Darn it, could it be...

1223
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:29,526
From space?!

1224
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:38,566
He's here!

1225
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,901
Uncle!

1226
01:05:40,942 --> 01:05:41,942
Dad!

1227
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:44,942
Welcome back!

1228
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,942
Sorry to make you worry, Ran.

1229
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:50,692
I'm so relieved...

1230
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:54,566
Sorry to have caused you trouble, Eri.

1231
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,484
What are you talking about?

1232
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:59,151
I'm so glad!

1233
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:02,067
Sonoko, thank you!

1234
01:06:02,484 --> 01:06:05,191
Right! I should send this emotional scene...

1235
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:07,691
...to that mystery-solving geek!

1236
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,650
Wait, Sonoko!

1237
01:06:09,651 --> 01:06:11,983
This should be able to reach him!

1238
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:13,526
Say cheese!

1239
01:06:17,942 --> 01:06:18,817
What?

1240
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:19,942
What's going on?

1241
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,983
Someone bring a spare light over!

1242
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:24,066
Inspector!

1243
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,275
The reserve generator appears to
be destroyed!

1244
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:27,067
What?!

1245
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,026
What's going on here?!

1246
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:32,733
A report from NAZU!

1247
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:34,650
There's been an unauthorised access...

1248
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:36,025
...into the unmanned probe!

1249
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:37,317
What?!

1250
01:06:37,442 --> 01:06:40,025
At this rate,
the capsule won't be able to eject...

1251
01:06:40,026 --> 01:06:41,442
...from the probe's main body!

1252
01:06:42,526 --> 01:06:43,858
The main body of Swan,

1253
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:45,734
will be burnt off in the atmosphere...

1254
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,983
but its landing spot is unpredictable,

1255
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:50,442
(NAZU Control Center)
and NAZU is now in a state of panic!

1256
01:06:51,151 --> 01:06:53,567
Here's the latest estimation data!

1257
01:06:54,651 --> 01:06:59,525
East longtitude 139°45′8″405.

1258
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:01,901
Based on their estimation, it's...

1259
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:04,901
It's here.

1260
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:08,109
No way...

1261
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:09,734
Conan!

1262
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:14,817
As expected, the culprit's target is...

1263
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:18,317
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department!

1264
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,775
The capsule will land
in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department?!

1265
01:07:20,776 --> 01:07:21,859
What's going on?!

1266
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:26,691
If it's a capsule larger
than four metres in diameter,

1267
01:07:26,692 --> 01:07:28,692
the damage will be unthinkable!

1268
01:07:29,026 --> 01:07:32,816
Prepare a huge transport vehicle right now!

1269
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,858
Evacuate everyone
within a one-kilometre radius

1270
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:37,025
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department!

1271
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:38,026
Yes, Sir!

1272
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:39,401
Let's go!

1273
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:41,441
Where's the evacuation map?!

1274
01:07:41,442 --> 01:07:42,609
There's no time!

1275
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:43,941
Dad...

1276
01:07:43,942 --> 01:07:46,109
Don't worry, I'm here.

1277
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:47,776
Eri, you too.

1278
01:07:48,442 --> 01:07:50,026
Do not leave my side!

1279
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,567
Yes...

1280
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:54,776
Good job.

1281
01:07:56,151 --> 01:07:58,566
The capsule that ejects
from the Swan's main body,

1282
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,691
is crashing down like a meteorite!

1283
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:03,775
In other words,
before it enters the atmosphere,

1284
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:05,942
we only have a small time frame
to control its path!

1285
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:09,191
Within a one-kilometre radius of

1286
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:11,941
(Head of Department of Environmental Conservation)
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,

1287
01:08:11,942 --> 01:08:14,483
the total number to be evacuated
from parks, hotels and offices,

1288
01:08:14,484 --> 01:08:16,317
(Cabinet, Settlement Room)
is over 150,000!

1289
01:08:16,817 --> 01:08:19,566
We have prepared an evacuation ground...

1290
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:21,608
(Head of the Traffic Department)
...away from the one-kilometre radius

1291
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,192
and cleared the roads for these people.

1292
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:28,733
(Department of Defense official)
Prime Minister! We've just received...

1293
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:31,442
...a report from NAZU
that they can't rewrite the data!

1294
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:32,567
What?

1295
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,400
The signal sent from the ground stations
to the probe...

1296
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:38,609
is specially encrypted.

1297
01:08:38,776 --> 01:08:41,233
But if those codes don't match,

1298
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:43,567
then they can't rewrite the probe's data!

1299
01:08:43,942 --> 01:08:46,816
In other words,
the culprit changed the code?!

1300
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:49,816
Yes, at the time when he hacked into NAZU...

1301
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:51,609
...and changed the probe's path!

1302
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:54,650
We need to find out what the code is!

1303
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:57,109
I would like you to be a cooperator.

1304
01:08:57,984 --> 01:09:00,983
Get a hold of this professor who
creates all these amazing inventions.

1305
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:02,276
What are you trying to do?

1306
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:07,192
Bring a dead person back to life!

1307
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:13,484
It's just like him,

1308
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:15,734
to think of such a strategy.

1309
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:17,191
It would be great

1310
01:09:17,192 --> 01:09:19,026
if we could extract the code
using this method.

1311
01:09:20,067 --> 01:09:23,109
I have successfully quickened the process!

1312
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:28,567
Professor, the footage is too unstable.

1313
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:31,525
This isn't going to work.

1314
01:09:31,526 --> 01:09:35,901
This is the first time I flew this at night!

1315
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:39,941
I want to fly a drone at night too!

1316
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,441
It's not fair for Professor to play alone!

1317
01:09:42,442 --> 01:09:43,900
All of you...

1318
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:47,317
They didn't show the Swan on TV!

1319
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:50,941
Okay, so who wants to give me a hand?

1320
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:53,150
Professor's control is too unstable.

1321
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,234
Hurray!

1322
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,359
I'm so excited!

1323
01:09:58,609 --> 01:10:00,401
How mean...

1324
01:10:00,984 --> 01:10:03,191
Leave it to these children,

1325
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:05,734
and let us proceed with the preparations.

1326
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:07,192
We are the...

1327
01:10:07,193 --> 01:10:08,566
Drone...

1328
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:10,026
Flying team!

1329
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:12,526
Go!

1330
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:18,233
Starting from now,

1331
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:20,358
approximately 30,000 people will be evacuated

1332
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:21,858
to the reclaimed land on Tokyo Bay,

1333
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:23,691
the Edge of Ocean.

1334
01:10:23,692 --> 01:10:24,733
Where was it again?

1335
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,109
I have no idea!

1336
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:31,067
Isn't that where they planned
to have the summit?

1337
01:10:31,484 --> 01:10:35,192
Indeed, we will evacuate to the Casino Tower.

1338
01:10:35,484 --> 01:10:36,984
Casino Tower?

1339
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,942
There it is!

1340
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:47,234
Right. I have to contact Shinichi!

1341
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:03,150
NAZU continues to send the code,

1342
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:05,359
but they still can't access the probe.

1343
01:11:06,692 --> 01:11:07,567
Darn it!

1344
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:09,941
We have got to find out the code,

1345
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:11,401
as fast as possible!

1346
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:44,776
Are you looking at data
from NAZU's ground station?

1347
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,609
Culprit behind the terrorist attacks?

1348
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,900
I didn't expect it to be you,

1349
01:11:53,901 --> 01:11:55,609
Prosecutor Kusakabe.

1350
01:11:55,984 --> 01:11:57,526
What's going on? Both of you?

1351
01:11:57,651 --> 01:12:00,234
I should have known it earlier,

1352
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,817
when I saw the list of
evidence you submitted.

1353
01:12:04,526 --> 01:12:07,025
Only the culprit himself could have known
that piece of glass,

1354
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:09,526
as a part of the real ignition.

1355
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:14,358
And you submitted that as evidence,

1356
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:15,900
when the ignition was still...

1357
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:18,776
...assumed to be the high-voltage cable!

1358
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:23,775
Nice timing.

1359
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:26,233
These are the trial documents from...

1360
01:12:26,234 --> 01:12:28,066
...last year's case of illegal access
in NAZU's system.

1361
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:29,526
The one you were in-charge of.

1362
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:31,525
I see.

1363
01:12:31,526 --> 01:12:32,941
The modus operandi of that case,

1364
01:12:32,942 --> 01:12:34,776
lies in making use of NOR
for unauthorised access.

1365
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:38,441
You employed the same method from the case...

1366
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,776
...you were in-charge of,
to carry out cyber-terror attacks.

1367
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,026
But you made a mistake with that.

1368
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:46,733
NAZU already completed a system,

1369
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:49,358
that could trace NOR users.

1370
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,484
Knowing that, you used a bugged NOR system...

1371
01:12:53,692 --> 01:12:58,359
...to fake an IoT terror attack
on your own superior.

1372
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:02,734
In order to make the police
go after that decoy,

1373
01:13:03,401 --> 01:13:06,901
you picked the opportune moment
to carry out the attack.

1374
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:09,983
Don't touch my stuff!

1375
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:11,026
Stop!

1376
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:27,275
There are traces of NOR usage
in that smartphone!

1377
01:13:27,276 --> 01:13:28,692
You've got to be kidding me!

1378
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:37,026
I won't let you get away!

1379
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:44,942
Darn it, that didn't work?!

1380
01:13:45,442 --> 01:13:46,651
No problem!

1381
01:13:58,192 --> 01:13:59,192
Darn!

1382
01:14:03,734 --> 01:14:04,692
Prosecutor Kusakabe,

1383
01:14:05,276 --> 01:14:07,483
are the public security police...

1384
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,816
...the reason behind your terrorist attacks?!

1385
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,108
If there's an explosion in the summit's hall,

1386
01:14:12,109 --> 01:14:14,650
and an American probe falls into Tokyo,

1387
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:18,276
the Public Security Bureau
will have no credibility left!

1388
01:14:18,484 --> 01:14:20,734
Why do you hate the PSB so much?

1389
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:23,816
With all the authority you PSBs have,

1390
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:25,566
public prosecutors like ourselves...

1391
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:27,358
...can't fight for justice fairly!

1392
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:28,816
Is it okay to sacrifice lives...

1393
01:14:28,817 --> 01:14:30,900
...in the name of justice?!

1394
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:33,401
It was never my intention
to kill any civilians!

1395
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:35,775
That is why the explosion occured

1396
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:37,776
when there were
only Public Security officers!

1397
01:14:38,317 --> 01:14:41,526
I chose an IoT attack
that wouldn't kill anyone!

1398
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:44,817
That's why I chose that crashing point
for the capsule!

1399
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:49,525
You caused the blackout
at the police department

1400
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,109
so that the civilians could evacuate?

1401
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:53,192
Yes.

1402
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:54,525
I see.

1403
01:14:54,526 --> 01:14:57,941
That's why you created
all those IoT attacks along the way,

1404
01:14:57,942 --> 01:14:59,816
to prevent people from entering.

1405
01:14:59,817 --> 01:15:03,776
Even so, there is bound to be casualties!

1406
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,483
For the sake of justice,
some sacrifices are definitely necessary.

1407
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:10,276
That's not what justice is about!

1408
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:13,442
My...

1409
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:17,483
My cooperator,

1410
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:19,109
was also sacrificed!

1411
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:21,317
Was it Haba?

1412
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:25,275
I knew it. Haba was your cooperator?

1413
01:15:25,276 --> 01:15:26,651
How did you...

1414
01:15:26,984 --> 01:15:29,276
It was your passcode.

1415
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,651
You seemed conscious of it,

1416
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:38,441
but didn't mute the sound...

1417
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:39,692
...so that you wouldn't forget him?

1418
01:15:40,109 --> 01:15:41,734
Haba Fumikazu.

1419
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:43,859
No.

1420
01:15:43,984 --> 01:15:47,442
It was so I would never forget to
get revenge on those scumbags!

1421
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:49,900
Every cooperator of the PSB...

1422
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:53,526
...reports to Zero and is managed
by their code number.

1423
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:58,026
But fellow officers wouldn't know
about each other's cooperators.

1424
01:15:58,401 --> 01:16:01,733
Until last year, we had no idea
about public security prosecutors...

1425
01:16:01,734 --> 01:16:03,442
...having cooperators.

1426
01:16:03,984 --> 01:16:08,275
So that's why you could dispose
of my cooperator so easily?!

1427
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:10,609
I see. There's a hidden reason,

1428
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,900
behind the case Haba created.

1429
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,775
I was the one...

1430
01:16:15,776 --> 01:16:17,359
...who asked Haba to do that.

1431
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:19,608
It was in order to research on...

1432
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,109
...the unauthorised access into NAZU.

1433
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:23,525
That access data,

1434
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:27,234
was in the game company
that the suspect made use of,

1435
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:30,234
and Haba wanted to steal that.

1436
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,400
(Tokyo Detention Center)
PSB's cooperators are tasked with...

1437
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:45,526
...illegal and risky activities
for investigation purposes,

1438
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:50,191
and that is why the relationship
between the officer

1439
01:16:50,192 --> 01:16:51,775
and cooperator is said to be stronger than
that of blood relatives.

1440
01:16:51,776 --> 01:16:54,984
It's not merely business.

1441
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,691
Connected by our sense of mission,

1442
01:16:57,692 --> 01:16:59,401
it's as if we are of one heart and mind.

1443
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:02,316
When they interrogated you,

1444
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,151
why didn't you tell them
you were my cooperator?!

1445
01:17:04,484 --> 01:17:08,150
I couldn't let my mistake cost you your job,

1446
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,983
as a public security prosecutor.

1447
01:17:09,984 --> 01:17:13,066
Rather than for me, think of yourself too!

1448
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:15,400
I understand the pain more than anyone else.

1449
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:17,359
When I was stripped of my mission for justice

1450
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,692
Please! Think of your own life too!

1451
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:26,316
The lives of many Japanese
are way more important...

1452
01:17:26,317 --> 01:17:28,109
...than my life alone.

1453
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:30,733
Like I always said,

1454
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:34,192
I share your resolution.

1455
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,442
(Prosecutor's Office)

1456
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:39,108
I revealed everything to the prosecutor...

1457
01:17:39,109 --> 01:17:40,567
...handling his case.

1458
01:17:41,234 --> 01:17:43,276
Haba was working for me.

1459
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:45,941
I instructed him to carry out the crime.

1460
01:17:45,942 --> 01:17:47,691
Even so, I will still press charges.

1461
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:48,526
What?!

1462
01:17:50,067 --> 01:17:53,066
Truly, I didn't expect the PSB to...

1463
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:54,566
Don't worry.

1464
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:56,900
I'll make sure your name is not revealed,

1465
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:59,442
and that the trial ends smoothly.

1466
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:02,151
That's not what I came here to say!

1467
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:06,608
After everything,
I wanted to speak directly with the PSB,

1468
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:08,317
and when I was heading
to the detention centre,

1469
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:12,817
Yes?

1470
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:15,692
Haba committed suicide.

1471
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:20,984
I don't know why, but...

1472
01:18:21,192 --> 01:18:23,066
after the PSB officers conducted
an irregular interrogation on him,

1473
01:18:23,067 --> 01:18:25,442
he ended his life.

1474
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:50,066
The ones who drove Haba to commit suicide...

1475
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:53,901
No, the PSB killed Haba!

1476
01:18:55,067 --> 01:18:57,066
That is why you planned to crash the probe...

1477
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:58,650
...into the Metropolitan Police Department.

1478
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,108
Yes, when I knew that
the day Swan would return...

1479
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:03,566
...is the same day Haba died...

1480
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,066
What about the IoT terror attacks?

1481
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:07,108
They were not a part of my plan,

1482
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:11,567
but I couldn't let an innocent man
get prosecuted.

1483
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:14,483
You carried out the IoT terror attacks

1484
01:19:14,484 --> 01:19:16,526
in order to prove Mouri Kogoro's innocence?

1485
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:19,816
But unfortunately, the damage done...

1486
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:21,442
...was more widespread than I expected.

1487
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:24,359
You cannot bear the burden of
so much wrongdoing.

1488
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:27,901
Tell us the code to the probe!

1489
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:31,983
Public prosecutors
are the protectors of justice!

1490
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:34,859
I can't let them get away
with what they did to Haba!

1491
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:36,900
Tell us the code!

1492
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:39,191
You might as well just arrest me!

1493
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,775
I will remain silent.

1494
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:43,109
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

1495
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,276
Kusakabe...

1496
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:51,858
It can't be!

1497
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:53,359
Why is Haba...?!

1498
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,234
This is live from the MPD.

1499
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:00,359
What's going on?

1500
01:20:00,692 --> 01:20:04,150
The PSB officer who interrogated him...

1501
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:06,359
...faked his suicide,

1502
01:20:06,692 --> 01:20:09,276
and made him start his life anew.

1503
01:20:09,567 --> 01:20:10,983
In order to hide the fact...

1504
01:20:10,984 --> 01:20:14,317
...that PSB officers employed cooperators
to assist in investigations...

1505
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:19,191
...and to prevent prosecutors
from having any other cooperators,

1506
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:21,567
even you were kept in the dark.

1507
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:24,650
We have the means to settle...

1508
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:26,442
...our own illegal activities.

1509
01:20:26,776 --> 01:20:28,776
But you have no such ability!

1510
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:32,859
That was the PSB's decision.

1511
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:36,650
Just like how Haba was obsessed
with becoming a judge,

1512
01:20:36,651 --> 01:20:40,776
you too, possess a strong sense of justice.

1513
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:44,191
And that was why...

1514
01:20:44,192 --> 01:20:46,400
...you made Haba your cooperator,

1515
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,858
because he had nowhere to
go after being dismissed.

1516
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:50,109
That's right.

1517
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:54,776
Kusakabe saved my life
from hitting rock bottom.

1518
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,901
Although it was a mere two years,

1519
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:01,525
Kusakabe's words to me were "Thanks to you,

1520
01:21:01,526 --> 01:21:04,067
I could fight on as a prosecutor!"

1521
01:21:04,984 --> 01:21:08,151
And that is why I continue to fight on.

1522
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:12,526
Kusakabe, tell them the code you changed!

1523
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:15,150
If it crashes into that place,

1524
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:17,067
Haba will not emerge unharmed!

1525
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:19,400
How deceitful.

1526
01:21:19,401 --> 01:21:21,984
That is how the PSB works!

1527
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:25,441
The Swan will soon enter the atmosphere!

1528
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:27,359
Still no idea on the code?!

1529
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:28,983
At this rate,

1530
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,983
they won't be able to
access the probe at all!

1531
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:33,276
Furuya, there's no time!

1532
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:36,108
Quick! Spill it!

1533
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:38,067
Prosecutor Kusakabe! Hurry!

1534
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,526
But...

1535
01:21:53,151 --> 01:21:54,567
Kusakabe...

1536
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:59,026
Is this the sense of justice
I believed you possessed?

1537
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:05,692
The code that I changed,

1538
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:08,526
through illegally accessing NAZU's system,
is...

1539
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:33,275
What? A blackout?!

1540
01:22:33,276 --> 01:22:38,151
Yes! In just five minutes
after it enters the atmosphere!

1541
01:22:38,484 --> 01:22:43,233
Within that time frame, there will be plasma.

1542
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:46,817
So we can't be sure
if the path could be altered.

1543
01:22:47,192 --> 01:22:50,358
And there could be a chance that
the parachute won't deploy.

1544
01:22:50,359 --> 01:22:51,526
No way!

1545
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:53,526
Let Haba...

1546
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:57,151
Let Haba be evacuated from there!

1547
01:22:57,859 --> 01:22:59,651
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

1548
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:05,900
Any word from Shinichi?

1549
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:07,359
No, not yet.

1550
01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:09,275
I got to his voicemail.

1551
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,400
What is that guy doing?

1552
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:15,151
Conan's phone seems to be out of battery.

1553
01:23:15,484 --> 01:23:18,817
If it's that guy, he'll be just fine.

1554
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:22,567
This is really high up.

1555
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:25,901
Hurry, over here!

1556
01:23:30,817 --> 01:23:32,401
Haba! Where are you?!

1557
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:37,609
What's going on?!

1558
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:40,651
He's not here.

1559
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:43,942
B-But from the phone screen,
he was definitely...

1560
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:47,358
What you saw was a composite video.

1561
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:48,567
What?!

1562
01:23:48,984 --> 01:23:51,941
Using a footage filmed with a drone,

1563
01:23:51,942 --> 01:23:55,484
combined to look as if
he was on the MPD's helipad.

1564
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:58,484
He's in a safe place right now.

1565
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:02,859
I see.

1566
01:24:03,276 --> 01:24:06,567
Amuro, if we can't alter the crashing path,

1567
01:24:06,901 --> 01:24:08,942
the landing point would be...

1568
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:12,776
Yes. A four-metre wide capsule
will crash land here,

1569
01:24:12,901 --> 01:24:16,734
with a speed of over 10km/s.

1570
01:24:17,192 --> 01:24:21,191
Are you able to get explosives right now?

1571
01:24:21,192 --> 01:24:23,817
Do you intend to destroy
a heat-resistant capsule?

1572
01:24:24,234 --> 01:24:25,109
No.

1573
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:29,401
We need just enough explosives to
change its course to the Pacific Ocean.

1574
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:33,692
Unbelievable...

1575
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:35,817
Have you any other ideas?

1576
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:39,609
Kazami, do it right now.

1577
01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:43,316
Yes, illegal activities like this are

1578
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:45,026
second nature to Public Security Officers.

1579
01:24:51,151 --> 01:24:56,566
This is one of the strongest explosives
we have confiscated.

1580
01:24:56,567 --> 01:24:58,276
Is it traceable?

1581
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:00,400
It's close to the deadline to be discarded,

1582
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:02,733
so all we have to do is rewrite the records
and it will be fine.

1583
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:03,692
Alright.

1584
01:25:03,693 --> 01:25:04,901
Please proceed.

1585
01:25:10,692 --> 01:25:12,026
Not a problem.

1586
01:25:12,192 --> 01:25:16,359
We'll send the capsule's projected course
to your address.

1587
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:20,401
Alright everyone, let's go!

1588
01:25:20,776 --> 01:25:21,858
Alright!

1589
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:22,734
Got it!

1590
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:24,858
Fancy asking me to calculate

1591
01:25:24,859 --> 01:25:27,192
an ideal place for activating the explosion

1592
01:25:27,734 --> 01:25:30,984
Darn it, what a slave driver!

1593
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:36,651
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi,

1594
01:25:37,026 --> 01:25:38,192
Genta.

1595
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:40,276
And Ai...

1596
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:44,067
You will protect this country!

1597
01:25:49,442 --> 01:25:52,066
It's shaking a lot!

1598
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:54,400
The Professor's things are too heavy!

1599
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,525
Let's just get rid of it!

1600
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:58,066
No way!

1601
01:25:58,067 --> 01:26:02,317
Those items are very precious!

1602
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:06,901
Error margin is within a 10-metre radius.

1603
01:26:07,484 --> 01:26:09,566
I'll send you the footage from the drone,

1604
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:11,816
so you take care of the timing.

1605
01:26:11,817 --> 01:26:13,817
Yeah, I'll leave it to you.

1606
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:16,109
But is it really okay?

1607
01:26:16,401 --> 01:26:20,776
For us to film the Swan
at such close distance?

1608
01:26:21,234 --> 01:26:24,401
No problem,
we have permission from the police.

1609
01:26:26,692 --> 01:26:29,192
Or rather, from the public security bureau.

1610
01:26:49,526 --> 01:26:50,734
What?

1611
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:52,859
(Cabinet Secretary)
The parachute didn't deploy?!

1612
01:26:53,067 --> 01:26:56,441
It appears to be locked onto the heat shield!

1613
01:26:56,442 --> 01:26:57,442
Prime Minister,

1614
01:26:57,443 --> 01:26:59,025
please give your permission to destroy it!

1615
01:26:59,026 --> 01:27:00,109
Hold on!

1616
01:27:00,734 --> 01:27:01,941
But...

1617
01:27:01,942 --> 01:27:03,650
If we try to destroy it at such a height,

1618
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,026
there will be more casualties.

1619
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:16,484
It has passed 30,000 metres in altitude.

1620
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:18,276
I got it.

1621
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,359
Don't make any mistake.

1622
01:27:23,442 --> 01:27:24,526
Understood!

1623
01:27:25,192 --> 01:27:26,401
Amuro!

1624
01:27:27,192 --> 01:27:28,859
Can we get the timing right this way?

1625
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:30,276
Yes.

1626
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:36,692
Approaching the capsule!

1627
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:40,776
I'm depending on you guys.

1628
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:46,901
At this rate, there will be a collision!

1629
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:48,941
Don't worry!

1630
01:27:48,942 --> 01:27:52,650
That drone has a system
that senses nearby objects,

1631
01:27:52,651 --> 01:27:56,025
and dodges automatically!

1632
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:58,316
Everyone. Unless you fly it closer,

1633
01:27:58,317 --> 01:28:00,234
we can't see the capsule flying in!

1634
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,608
I want to see it!

1635
01:28:02,609 --> 01:28:04,525
Go, Mitsuhiko!

1636
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:05,734
I got it!

1637
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:12,192
Kudo, don't do anything reckless.

1638
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:38,651
It's coming!

1639
01:28:40,984 --> 01:28:42,984
Go!

1640
01:29:10,192 --> 01:29:12,776
The parachute deployed!

1641
01:29:17,734 --> 01:29:20,776
- What?
- We can't see anything?

1642
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:23,901
Did it crash?!

1643
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:27,109
Doesn't it have an automatic dodge system?!

1644
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:29,608
Ah, perhaps...

1645
01:29:29,609 --> 01:29:31,692
...the battery went flat.

1646
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:34,901
There never was such a system.

1647
01:29:35,942 --> 01:29:38,359
I guess it all went well?

1648
01:29:38,651 --> 01:29:40,359
I'm amazed.

1649
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:43,734
Who are you guys?

1650
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:46,441
I guess you could call us...

1651
01:29:46,442 --> 01:29:48,817
...the small detective's cooperators.

1652
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:53,109
Got it.

1653
01:29:53,901 --> 01:29:55,108
It was a success.

1654
01:29:55,109 --> 01:29:56,276
That's great!

1655
01:29:56,734 --> 01:29:57,942
Furuya,

1656
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:00,567
I'll bring the suspect back.

1657
01:30:01,026 --> 01:30:02,026
Okay.

1658
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:03,109
Hold on.

1659
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,317
Kusakabe,

1660
01:30:07,942 --> 01:30:11,317
even now, we are still of one heart and mind.

1661
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:14,109
Yeah.

1662
01:30:14,651 --> 01:30:16,151
Let's go.

1663
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:19,025
Fumikazu!

1664
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:20,067
Kyoko!

1665
01:30:22,234 --> 01:30:23,192
Fumikazu...

1666
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:26,692
You're still alive.

1667
01:30:27,067 --> 01:30:28,442
He's really...

1668
01:30:28,692 --> 01:30:30,817
...one scary person.

1669
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,776
So you were a cooperator too...

1670
01:30:34,734 --> 01:30:38,026
And moreover, for a prosecutor!

1671
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:43,234
Ms. Kyoko.

1672
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,609
You were a cooperator too, weren't you?

1673
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,609
For Officer Kazami.

1674
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:51,734
Boy, did you hear about it?

1675
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,651
The reason I employed Haba.

1676
01:30:55,776 --> 01:30:58,650
As a dismissed employee,

1677
01:30:58,651 --> 01:31:02,233
the PSB had their eyes on him.

1678
01:31:02,234 --> 01:31:03,650
(4 years ago, Tachibana Law Firm)

1679
01:31:03,651 --> 01:31:05,066
So I employed him,

1680
01:31:05,067 --> 01:31:09,109
and made him report his actions.

1681
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:13,109
But in the process...

1682
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:15,025
...of working with him,

1683
01:31:15,026 --> 01:31:17,026
I was somehow attracted to him.

1684
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:19,609
The feeling was mutual.

1685
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:25,609
That's why I'm really sorry that
things turned out this way.

1686
01:31:26,942 --> 01:31:29,942
So you were a cooperator, just like me.

1687
01:31:33,692 --> 01:31:35,525
Everything started with the...

1688
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:38,025
...illegal access into NAZU's system,
didn't it?

1689
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:38,901
Yes.

1690
01:31:39,817 --> 01:31:43,151
The PSB had instructed me to investigate,

1691
01:31:43,442 --> 01:31:45,442
while assuming the suspect to be guilty.

1692
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:48,858
At that time,
he was arrested at the game company...

1693
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:51,276
...frequented by the suspect.

1694
01:31:52,942 --> 01:31:56,901
I didn't know why he did that.

1695
01:31:59,317 --> 01:32:03,442
I begged the PSB to help him.

1696
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:05,734
But he commited suicide,

1697
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:08,609
and I hated the PSB as a result.

1698
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:10,983
I closed down my firm,

1699
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:14,733
and searched for an opportunity
to get revenge.

1700
01:32:14,734 --> 01:32:15,859
And that was when,

1701
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:19,400
you were instructed to defend Uncle Kogoro...

1702
01:32:19,401 --> 01:32:21,109
...and prove his innocence?

1703
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:24,566
Yes. I didn't understand why the PSB...

1704
01:32:24,567 --> 01:32:27,651
...wanted to make him innocent,

1705
01:32:28,067 --> 01:32:30,901
so I thought I should do the opposite.

1706
01:32:31,317 --> 01:32:33,858
And implicate an innocent person?!

1707
01:32:33,859 --> 01:32:35,651
I had no choice!

1708
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:38,609
I had no idea...

1709
01:32:38,942 --> 01:32:42,651
...he was still alive
and under the protection of the PSB!

1710
01:32:43,026 --> 01:32:45,651
If I had known, I wouldn't have...

1711
01:32:50,026 --> 01:32:51,859
Fumikazu is now...

1712
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,734
...your cooperator, right?

1713
01:32:56,901 --> 01:32:58,609
What is his number?

1714
01:32:59,151 --> 01:33:00,317
Number?

1715
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:05,692
Internally,
the PSB knows us by number, right?

1716
01:33:06,609 --> 01:33:09,109
I'm 2291, aren't I?!

1717
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:12,942
So, what is his number?!

1718
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:15,526
Tachibana Kyoko.

1719
01:33:16,442 --> 01:33:19,776
You are released from your position
as the PSB's cooperator.

1720
01:33:20,234 --> 01:33:21,692
Is it alright? Kazami.

1721
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:25,817
We have to settle any illegal activities
on our parts.

1722
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:28,442
That's Public Security, isn't it?

1723
01:33:29,567 --> 01:33:31,691
This is Haba's location.

1724
01:33:31,692 --> 01:33:33,692
You are free now.

1725
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:37,316
If you want to meet him, we won't stop you.

1726
01:33:37,317 --> 01:33:38,317
Don't be so presumptuous!

1727
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:48,651
To be your cooperator was my decision!

1728
01:33:48,817 --> 01:33:51,526
To betray you was also my decision!

1729
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:54,317
And to love him, was my own decision too!

1730
01:33:55,026 --> 01:33:57,109
Do not for one moment,

1731
01:33:57,484 --> 01:34:00,817
think that you can control my entire life!

1732
01:34:09,817 --> 01:34:11,067
Goodbye.

1733
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:15,359
Kyoko...

1734
01:34:20,609 --> 01:34:22,650
No matter how much we are hated,

1735
01:34:22,651 --> 01:34:24,359
we have to protect her, and that's...

1736
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:27,984
- What's that?
- Public security.

1737
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:34,066
Thanks to you,
we were able to arrest the terrorist...

1738
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:35,942
...who underestimated Japan.

1739
01:34:36,192 --> 01:34:38,067
At which point did you know
it was a terrorist attack?

1740
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:40,234
It's as you inferred.

1741
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:43,441
That day,

1742
01:34:43,442 --> 01:34:46,150
while inspecting the conference hall,

1743
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:49,401
I realised that the gas line could be
controlled remotely via the internet.

1744
01:34:51,151 --> 01:34:54,401
I figured it could be used
for a terrorist attack,

1745
01:34:54,609 --> 01:34:57,484
and ordered a security inspection.

1746
01:35:00,734 --> 01:35:02,900
But based on the situation at the scene,

1747
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:05,442
it could be ruled as an accident.

1748
01:35:06,026 --> 01:35:08,442
So you had to create a suspect.

1749
01:35:08,942 --> 01:35:11,691
And we had to have that suspect...

1750
01:35:11,692 --> 01:35:16,734
...handed over to us as soon as possible.

1751
01:35:17,151 --> 01:35:20,900
That's why you arranged for Kyoko...

1752
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:22,900
...to defend Uncle Kogoro,

1753
01:35:22,901 --> 01:35:25,401
and to have him released
while preventing the ruling of an accident.

1754
01:35:26,109 --> 01:35:30,192
You're amazing,
you solved the entire mystery.

1755
01:35:30,567 --> 01:35:33,692
No, I have one mystery unsolved.

1756
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:34,651
And that's...

1757
01:35:34,652 --> 01:35:35,776
Phone.

1758
01:35:36,484 --> 01:35:38,859
Your phone has been glowing since just now.

1759
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,109
(Mouri Ran)

1760
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:45,733
Shinichi?

1761
01:35:45,734 --> 01:35:49,441
I have been evacuated to the Casino Tower
in Edge of Ocean.

1762
01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:51,776
Call me when you get this message.

1763
01:35:52,484 --> 01:35:53,608
What?

1764
01:35:53,609 --> 01:35:54,484
The capsule?!

1765
01:35:57,442 --> 01:35:59,733
An unknown explosion...

1766
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:03,108
...has caused the capsule to crash enroute
to Tokyo Bay's reclaimed land area!

1767
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:05,108
One of the reclaimed land areas,

1768
01:36:05,109 --> 01:36:08,608
is the Edge of Ocean
with 30,000 people in it!

1769
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:10,526
There's nothing we can do!

1770
01:36:11,067 --> 01:36:13,817
- Take it slowly.
- We still have time.

1771
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:16,776
Everyone, please calm down!

1772
01:36:17,067 --> 01:36:18,650
Just like how we came here,

1773
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:20,526
everyone can get onboard!

1774
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:21,942
Inspector...

1775
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,109
There's been an error in the report,

1776
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:26,608
and civilian vehicles are evacuating here!

1777
01:36:26,609 --> 01:36:27,816
What?!

1778
01:36:27,817 --> 01:36:30,317
There's a huge traffic jam
on the two bridges here!

1779
01:36:36,276 --> 01:36:37,567
This is a problem.

1780
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:39,442
Everyone is panicking.

1781
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:42,192
Shinichi...

1782
01:36:44,026 --> 01:36:46,984
Darn it, I can't reach Ran!

1783
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,567
What should we do? There's no time!

1784
01:36:49,692 --> 01:36:53,567
Amuro, this time,
I'll need you as my cooperator.

1785
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:08,026
There's a traffic jam ahead!

1786
01:37:08,817 --> 01:37:11,484
The evacuation instruction
wasn't carried out properly?!

1787
01:38:15,401 --> 01:38:17,317
Is that the Casino Tower?

1788
01:38:17,484 --> 01:38:18,817
Furuya!

1789
01:38:19,859 --> 01:38:23,025
The capsule's parachute has fallen off
and it's now accelerating!

1790
01:38:23,026 --> 01:38:24,026
What?!

1791
01:38:24,401 --> 01:38:27,566
The estimated point of crash
from NAZU is out!

1792
01:38:27,567 --> 01:38:31,734
In five minutes,
it will crash into Casino Tower!

1793
01:38:32,317 --> 01:38:33,859
- I'll send over the data!
- Ran...

1794
01:38:34,026 --> 01:38:35,900
Darn it, what should I do?!

1795
01:38:35,901 --> 01:38:37,109
What should we do?!

1796
01:38:40,109 --> 01:38:41,151
Amuro!

1797
01:38:42,692 --> 01:38:44,192
Hold on tight!

1798
01:38:49,526 --> 01:38:51,192
What do you have in mind?!

1799
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:15,192
Here!

1800
01:39:31,151 --> 01:39:33,484
I thought I was going to die...

1801
01:39:33,651 --> 01:39:35,650
That was amazing though.

1802
01:39:35,651 --> 01:39:37,608
So, what should I do?

1803
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:38,942
Hold on!

1804
01:39:42,942 --> 01:39:45,234
Head for that building under construction!

1805
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:49,026
Alright!

1806
01:39:57,276 --> 01:39:59,316
Don't leave my side.

1807
01:39:59,317 --> 01:40:00,317
Okay.

1808
01:40:00,567 --> 01:40:03,026
It looks like the situation got worse.

1809
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,234
Can we make it?

1810
01:40:15,817 --> 01:40:17,566
Considering the height of this building,

1811
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:19,692
and the distance to Casino Tower...

1812
01:40:19,984 --> 01:40:22,484
If you accelerate from here after 1 minute...

1813
01:40:24,859 --> 01:40:26,484
It's do-or-die.

1814
01:40:27,734 --> 01:40:30,734
Please make it in time!

1815
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:32,151
Ran!

1816
01:40:34,984 --> 01:40:36,066
What?

1817
01:40:36,067 --> 01:40:38,026
The power of love is great.

1818
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:52,066
I've been wanting to ask you this.

1819
01:40:52,067 --> 01:40:54,067
Do you have a girlfriend, Amuro?

1820
01:41:01,067 --> 01:41:02,317
My...

1821
01:41:02,609 --> 01:41:04,151
lover, is...

1822
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:07,276
...this country.

1823
01:41:12,776 --> 01:41:13,901
Let's go!

1824
01:41:14,276 --> 01:41:16,526
Can I miss by a millimetre?

1825
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:18,692
That's part of the plan.

1826
01:41:20,192 --> 01:41:21,275
5!

1827
01:41:21,276 --> 01:41:22,400
4!

1828
01:41:22,401 --> 01:41:23,401
3!

1829
01:41:23,401 --> 01:41:24,317
2!

1830
01:41:24,484 --> 01:41:25,317
1!

1831
01:41:25,567 --> 01:41:26,651
0!

1832
01:41:33,526 --> 01:41:35,566
It's no use, it's not high enough!

1833
01:41:35,567 --> 01:41:36,984
Bring it on!

1834
01:42:11,151 --> 01:42:17,776
Go!

1835
01:42:31,192 --> 01:42:32,776
Dad!

1836
01:42:33,692 --> 01:42:34,734
Ran!

1837
01:43:34,234 --> 01:43:36,400
We'll take care of the rest from here.

1838
01:43:36,401 --> 01:43:38,358
You should get going.

1839
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:40,442
There's still a mystery unsolved.

1840
01:43:41,067 --> 01:43:43,859
Why did you choose to involve Uncle Kogoro?

1841
01:43:45,901 --> 01:43:47,608
Because of my position,

1842
01:43:47,609 --> 01:43:49,776
I can't openly participate in investigations.

1843
01:43:50,192 --> 01:43:52,108
So if I involved him in the case,

1844
01:43:52,109 --> 01:43:54,859
you'd definitely become my cooperator.

1845
01:43:56,692 --> 01:43:57,941
Wasn't that the only way

1846
01:43:57,942 --> 01:44:01,109
I could make use of your true ability?

1847
01:44:04,734 --> 01:44:06,942
You give me too much credit.

1848
01:48:28,359 --> 01:48:30,025
(Agasa)
Inspired by investigation reports...

1849
01:48:30,026 --> 01:48:32,526
...that are akin to a "manual for crime",

1850
01:48:32,859 --> 01:48:36,941
the former prosecutor began a chain of
terrorist attacks...

1851
01:48:36,942 --> 01:48:40,442
...based on this strange motive.

1852
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:43,276
It looks like the PSB was changed.

1853
01:48:43,776 --> 01:48:47,234
That must have been the PSB's doing as well.

1854
01:48:48,234 --> 01:48:51,775
It has been safely retrieved
from its landing spot in Tokyo Bay.

1855
01:48:51,776 --> 01:48:53,608
The capsule of the unmanned probe, Swan,

1856
01:48:53,609 --> 01:48:55,941
contains material from Mars.

1857
01:48:55,942 --> 01:48:57,525
We can look forward to solving...

1858
01:48:57,526 --> 01:49:00,317
...more mysteries of the universe.

1859
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:03,150
- The unmanned probe, Swan,
- Amazing!

1860
01:49:03,151 --> 01:49:05,525
But I wanted to see it from the drone...

1861
01:49:05,526 --> 01:49:08,526
We should have thrown out Professor's stuff.

1862
01:49:10,776 --> 01:49:13,233
These children have no idea

1863
01:49:13,234 --> 01:49:17,483
how much they contributed to the retrieval.

1864
01:49:17,484 --> 01:49:21,067
Yes, but we saved Japan from a huge crisis.

1865
01:49:21,651 --> 01:49:23,776
They really are an amazing bunch of people.

1866
01:49:24,484 --> 01:49:28,692
Alright!
Let's explore Mars with Professor's drone!

1867
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:30,608
That's a good idea!

1868
01:49:30,609 --> 01:49:31,733
Let's do it!

1869
01:49:31,734 --> 01:49:34,316
Professor! Please make a new drone!

1870
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:36,984
Make a bigger one!

1871
01:49:38,609 --> 01:49:40,483
Maybe I can try...

1872
01:49:40,484 --> 01:49:41,567
Hurray!

1873
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:44,734
I'm excited for Mars!

1874
01:49:46,026 --> 01:49:48,484
No, that's not possible.
