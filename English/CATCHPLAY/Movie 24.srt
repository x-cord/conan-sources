1
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,314
What have I done to deserve this?

2
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,290
Damn it!

3
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,010
WSG Boston is going to start soon,
but the stadium is yet to be completed.

4
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,300
Wonder if it is going to be
finished by the opening day?

5
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:05,020
If it remains unfinished,
the whole nation is gonna be furious.

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,390
You said it!

7
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,839
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

8
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,210
This Hyper Linear Liner has

9
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,057
a maximum speed of an amazing
1,000 kilometers per hour!

10
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:21,050
HYPER LINEAR LINER

11
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,824
Amazing! Like a flash!

12
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,284
Amazing!

13
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,890
I can't wait to ride it!

14
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,980
Everyone, thank you
for your generous applause!

15
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:36,360
This newly created Hyper Linear Liner

16
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,820
can reach Shibahama Station in Tokyo
from Shin-Nagoya Station

17
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,320
in an astounding 25 minutes!

18
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,120
Amazing!

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,290
But where is this Shibahama Station?

20
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,880
What, you don't know, Genta-kun?

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,814
Nope.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,420
The lady said she's going to
explain right now.

23
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,796
Oh, that's perfect.

24
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:03,324
Now, then, Shibahama Station lies between
Kawashina and Okamatsucho stations,

25
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,284
and was built to accommodate
the Hyper Linear Liner's arrivals and departures.

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,230
And an underground passageway
connects the station to this venue,

27
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,874
the Shibahama View Hotel.
Shibahama Stadium,

28
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,964
where the WSG Tokyo Opening Ceremonies
will be held next month,

29
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,228
will also have
a direct connection as well.

30
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,120
Even after WSG Tokyo opens,
the area around Shibahama Station,

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,330
as the Hyper Linear's terminal station,
is expected to be a place

32
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,370
where people come together.

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,920
What does "WSG" mean?

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,854
I don't know.

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,460
Um, I believe it's...

36
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,380
What's bugging you guys?

37
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,121
Oh, Conan-kun and Ai-chan.

38
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,720
That was a long trip to the bathroom.

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,930
It took a while to find it, that's all.

40
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,060
Sorry to make you all wait!

41
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,494
Hey, Conan.

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,770
Do you know what "WSG" is?

43
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,464
Yeah, of course.

44
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:59,518
"World Sports Games" or WSG for short.

45
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,185
It's a sporting event that's held
once every four years!

46
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:06,870
Athletes from all over the world will
compete for the honor of their country!

47
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,490
...the Hyper Linear train will finally
be unveiled to the public!

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,250
Among those who will be on board that day
are the WSG Tokyo sponsors here today,

49
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,260
and members of the WSG Association
from each nation.

50
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,569
And today, representing
all of those nations, we have a comment

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,890
from the International WSG Association,
president Alan MacKenzie-san.

52
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,310
The Director of the FBI?

53
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:35,053
Hello, everyone in Japan.

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,400
I look forward to attending
the opening ceremony

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,570
of WSG Tokyo with all of you,

56
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,925
and getting on the world's first
Hyper Linear with everyone.

57
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,990
Thank you very much, Alan-san!

58
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,870
We also have another
announcement for you all.

59
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,184
Lucky them! I wish I could ride it, too!

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,104
-Us commoners don't stand a chance.
-Members of the general public will be

61
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,210
chosen through a random drawing
to ride the Hyper Linear, as well!

62
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,380
All right!

63
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,234
-Oh, brother...
-Wow, so much hype!

64
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,260
You'd think they'd already
won the tickets.

65
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,324
But isn't it a bit too early to celebrate?

66
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,074
Huh? Why?

67
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,100
She said it was a random
drawing, remember?

68
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,770
What do you think
the odds of winning actually are?

69
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,560
Man, they're such cheap dark overlords.

70
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,084
No, we still have a way!

71
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,070
I believe that several companies
in the Suzuki Conglomerate

72
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,860
are WSG Tokyo sponsors.

73
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,384
I see! We just have to go ask
Sonoko-oneesan!

74
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,594
"We just have to ask"? No way.

75
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:34,877
Those Platinum Tickets
aren't easy to snag!

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,330
Life just isn't that easy!

77
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:41,314
Now, now, Sonoko, shouldn't I
at least try to ask?

78
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,610
Right. Maybe just enough for the children...

79
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,390
Jeez, aren't you being
way too soft on these brats?

80
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,430
Please stay out of this!

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,244
We were this close!

82
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,030
Don't ruin it for us!

83
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,511
Look here.

84
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:01,833
Be grateful you could even come here!
(WSG TOKYO SPONSOR COMPANY SEND-OFF PARTY)

85
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,110
Okay.

86
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm terribly sorry to bother you,

87
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,357
but can we start setting up
the food wagons here?

88
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:10,950
Oh, sure.

89
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,064
We'll get out of the way.

90
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,606
-Looks delicious!
-Looks delicious!

91
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,831
Everyone, meet up in front of the door
after you finish grabbing your food!

92
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,034
-Okay!
-Okay!

93
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,840
All right, let's go!

94
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,904
Yeah!

95
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,154
Let's eat a ton and get our money's worth!

96
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,484
Genta-kun, only the person
who paid gets to say that.

97
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,180
They sure switch gears real quick.

98
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,164
Well, sure.
They are younger than us, after all.

99
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,744
"Younger"? You and I are still in our teens.

100
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,294
All right then, let's be flexible.
Here's to the innocent little kids.

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,530
Cheers.

102
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,294
A blackout?

103
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,395
What the?

104
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,132
What just happened?

105
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,790
What was that light?

106
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,960
Sorry, Haibara. Can you hold my glass for me?

107
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,017
Huh? Hey, Edogawa-kun!

108
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,826
Oh, come on!

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,506
I'm sure I saw a light around here.

110
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,359
Conan, are you all right?

111
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,713
Ran... neechan.

112
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,270
Y-Yeah.

113
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,869
Hey, they're back on.

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,650
Now I've got to look for the kids.

115
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,570
Dad?

116
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,884
If you're here, answer me!

117
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,240
Sonoko, what's wrong?

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,344
Oh, Ran!

119
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,330
Actually, I can't find my dad anywhere.

120
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,264
Calls aren't going through either!

121
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,620
But you were with him just now.

122
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,920
Right, but when the emergency lights
came on, he was gone...

123
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,380
Really, where did he go?

124
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh, it's John-san.

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,300
John-san!

126
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,194
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation.
JOHN VOIT (51) JAPAN CODE CEO

127
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,016
May I have a minute of your time?

128
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,430
Oh, Sonoko-san! What can I do for you?

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,810
Um, it's about my father
who was just with us a few minutes ago.

130
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,946
Do you happen to know where he is now?

131
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,870
U-Um, John-san?

132
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,280
-I know nothing!
-Ah! John-san!

133
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,490
Sir, please don't run!

134
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,979
Hey, that's dangerous.

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,694
-Ran, did I say anything weird?
-Edogawa-kun.

136
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,120
The blackout lasted
about 30 seconds, right?

137
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,250
Yeah, not much of a window to just
vanish from a huge place like this.

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,880
That means it's time for us!

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
It's been a while.

140
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,090
Right!

141
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
We...

142
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,904
We...

143
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,600
We are...

144
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,474
-We are the Detective Boys, after all!
-We are the Detective Boys, after all!

145
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,870
DETECTIVE BOYS

146
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:51,382
Sonoko-neechan, why don't we
have the hotel clerks look for him?

147
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

148
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,820
-Inspector Megure!
-Inspector Megure!

149
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,134
What's the situation?

150
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,910
Chairman Suzuki still hasn't been found.

151
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,830
I see...

152
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,210
He still hasn't responded to
the calls from the building PA, either.

153
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,000
This may be a kidnapping for ransom.

154
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,195
Also, Conan-kun and the others
were also attending the party.

155
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,760
We have a testimony that a light
similar to a whitish blue spark

156
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,198
was seen right after
the power outage happened.

157
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,930
Let's hear what they have to say.

158
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,239
I think it was that thing...

159
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,680
You know, the one
that villains in TV dramas use

160
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,230
to shock people and make them pass out.

161
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,992
-A stun gun!?
-Don't tell me...!

162
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:32,376
Someone stunned
and abducted the Chairman too?

163
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,254
Chairman Suzuki "too"?

164
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,990
But it's impossible to drag

165
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,171
an unconscious person
out of here in 30 seconds.

166
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,950
You've checked
the security cameras, right?

167
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,830
Yes. After the emergency lights came on,

168
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,307
there was no sign
of any suspicious-looking activity.

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,920
So how did they spirit away an
unconscious person with everyone watching?

170
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,944
And what was their purpose?

171
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,170
Just as I thought!

172
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,930
-What's the matter?
-Did you find something?

173
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,921
I smell eel from somewhere around here!

174
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,244
So those kids followed us here
from the room?

175
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,940
-What? I don't smell it at all.
-Let's send them back right away.

176
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,053
I can still smell eel here,
so where the heck are they?

177
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,727
So that's it!

178
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,105
Hey, this spot... There's exactly
one wagon's width open here.

179
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,500
Maybe there was some food here as well?

180
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,684
Let's see...

181
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,090
That's where the broiled eel and rice
steamed with eel sauce should be.

182
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,010
What's that? Sounds super tasty!

183
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,825
But that's strange.

184
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,180
Since we'd only just served
all the rice dishes,

185
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,890
how could it be gone already?

186
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,100
Perhaps it was too delicious
and popular, so it ran out already?

187
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,744
No, look here.

188
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,126
A person would fit down here.

189
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,169
You don't think they used that
to transport Chairman Suzuki?

190
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,690
True, they could have carried him out
this way without attracting attention.

191
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,950
But in that case,
wouldn't the most likely suspect

192
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:05,107
be either a hotel worker,
or someone dressed up like one?

193
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:10,040
Find any witnesses who saw a hotel worker
pushing a wagon out of here!

194
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,394
Go back and check
the hotel security cameras again, too!

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,920
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
And you kids need to go back
to the room immediately!

197
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,340
-Okay!
-Okay!

198
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,864
This way.

199
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,850
The smell of eels is heading this way!

200
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,454
Genta-kun, you're amazing! Like a police dog!

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,480
I didn't know you had such a talent!

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,044
What, you telling me you guys didn't know?

203
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,440
I have a feeling we did.

204
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,990
It's getting really close! The smell is
getting stronger and stronger!

205
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:48,466
The place is empty, huh?

206
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,274
They're interrogating
the employees right now.

207
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,305
How's it looking, Genta-kun?

208
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,024
I'm sure it's somewhere inside this room.

209
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,397
I found it.

210
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,444
For real, Haibara-san?

211
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,320
That wagon in the back.

212
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,531
It's the same as the ones
back at the party venue, isn't it?

213
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,310
Found him!

214
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:17,704
What's a male worker's uniform doing here?

215
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,544
Edogawa-kun!

216
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,580
Chairman Suzuki isn't inside the wagon!

217
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:23,903
Got it!

218
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,450
That looks so tasty!

219
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,844
You mustn't eat any. It's evidence.

220
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,804
-What?! I can't?
-Broiling sauce?

221
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,200
That's right!

222
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,034
Found him.

223
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,904
MEDICAL OFFICE

224
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,430
So the perp's face?

225
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,611
I didn't see them.

226
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,770
There was the blackout,
and the next thing I knew, these kids—

227
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,874
It's all thanks to us,
the Detective Boys! Right?

228
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,342
-Right!
-Yup, yup!

229
00:12:57,424 --> 00:13:00,772
Inspector, his testimony is
the same as President Mitsuzuka's.

230
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,990
So the same thing happened to
this "President Mitsuzuka," huh?

231
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:09,238
So that really was a criminal incident after all?

232
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,790
Hey, Dad, what are you talking about?

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,279
Remember me telling you about that friend
I met last week who suddenly disappeared?

234
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,024
You mean that female CEO that
you've been golfing a lot with lately.

235
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,151
Is that so, honey?

236
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:22,814
EIKO MITSUZUKA (48)
MISTUZUKA CONFECTIONERIES COMPANY PRESIDENT

237
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,840
Oh, no, we don't go alone.

238
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,090
But right after the police came,

239
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,492
they found her
in the golf course bathroom, right?

240
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:36,810
Yes, but she never told us anything
about what happened that day.

241
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,374
And she didn't come
to the party today, either.

242
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,424
Wait, so is this lady CEO named
Mitsuzuka also a WSG Tokyo sponsor?

243
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,061
Yeah, that's right.

244
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,460
Eiko Mitsuzuka. She's the president
of Mitsuzuka Confectioneries.

245
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,040
Hey, I've seen this logo before!

246
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,484
Cause it's the same logo
on Masked Yaiber candy bars!

247
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,630
You're right.

248
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,050
What I'm more worried about—

249
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,930
Hey, look! It says "Masked Yaiber Show!"

250
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,778
It looks like there's one at Shibahama Station
the day of the Linear's first run!

251
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:14,720
MASKED YAIBER SHOW
JULY 24, SHIBAHAMA STATION SQUARE

252
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,824
-Are you kidding me? I so wanna go!
-Indeed!

253
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,940
Sorry, but...

254
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,860
It looks like they've long since
closed down applications for tickets.

255
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
What?

256
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,480
-What the...
-What a bummer!

257
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,740
Anyway, what's bothering you is...

258
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,594
-...this, right?
-Yeah.

259
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,540
Both this company and Chairman Suzuki's
company are sponsors for WSG Tokyo.

260
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,500
And the leaders of both companies were
just abducted, one after the other.

261
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,630
Could it be a coincidence?

262
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,880
Yes?

263
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,904
It's me.

264
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,640
I know this is sudden, but you know
about the WSG Serial Kidnappings

265
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,100
from 15 years ago, right?

266
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,310
Of course.

267
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,150
That abominable incident may be
happening again... This time in Tokyo.

268
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,789
Yes, it seems that way.

269
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,630
DETECTIVE CONAN: THE SCARLET BULLET

270
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,711
I'm Shinichi Kudo,
a high school student detective.

271
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:36,890
I went to an amusement park with my
childhood friend and classmate Ran Mori.

272
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,480
There, I witnessed a man in black
making a suspicious deal.

273
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,730
I was so caught up in watching the deal

274
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,530
that I didn't notice his accomplice
approaching me from behind.

275
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,660
That man force-fed me poison,
and when I woke up...

276
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,710
My body had shrunk!

277
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,130
If they were to find out
that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

278
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,510
my life, and the lives of those
around me, would be in danger.

279
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,154
On Professor Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

280
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,720
And when Ran asked me what my name was,
I blurted out "Conan Edogawa" in a panic.

281
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,100
And then, to gather information on them,

282
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,690
I ended up crashing at Ran's house,
since her dad's a detective.

283
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm not the only one
after the syndicate of men in black.

284
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,240
The Federal Bureau of Investigation,

285
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,580
the FBI's James Black, Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling. And Shuichi Akai.

286
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,974
He's the top sniper in the FBI.

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,580
Right now, he's disguised as
a grad school student named Subaru Okiya,

288
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,750
and is hiding out in the Kudo residence...
in other words, my house.

289
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,590
His younger sister, Masumi Sera.

290
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,260
She's a female high school
student detective

291
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,930
who transferred into Ran's class.

292
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,810
She's living in a hotel
with a mysterious girl,

293
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,230
but that girl is most likely
Akai-san's mother, Mary.

294
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,874
If she'd been administered
the same drug as I was,

295
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,520
and her body had shrunken...

296
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,410
This guy that calls her "Mother Mary" is
Sera's other older brother,

297
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,950
Shukichi Haneda.

298
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,830
Currently, he's the holder
of six championship titles in shogi.

299
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,250
In other words, these four are
all members of one family.

300
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,170
And this family is about to become
deeply involved in this case...

301
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:33,234
Although I've become smaller,
my intelligence is the same!

302
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,442
A great detective who leaves no case unsolved!

303
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,756
There is always only one truth!

304
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,848
Sonoko-oneesan!

305
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:48,051
Can we really take
all these Yaiber goods home?

306
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,188
There's even a Yaiber scarf!

307
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:51,770
And action figures!

308
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:56,354
They're all presents for you guys!
It's my thanks for finding Dad for me!

309
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:59,292
-Hurray!
-Good for you, guys!

310
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:01,691
-I think I'll pass...
-Me, too.

311
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,668
Actually, there is one more thing.

312
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,724
Ta-da-da-dah!

313
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,587
What do you think these are?

314
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:11,670
-What are those?
-Letters from somebody?

315
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:12,880
Nope!

316
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:15,050
What? Tell us the answer!

317
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,415
These are the Platinum Tickets
that are being raffled off nationwide,

318
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,229
which will get you on board
the Hyper Linear train!

319
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:26,496
Amazing!

320
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,980
Way to go, Sonoko-sama!

321
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,381
Thank you very much!

322
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,677
It's still too soon to be rejoicing!

323
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,471
Even I could only manage to
get my hands on six of these tickets.

324
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:39,298
-Just six.
-Just six.

325
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:40,846
Which means...

326
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,886
One.

327
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,846
Two.

328
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,101
Three.

329
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,556
Four, five, six, seven.

330
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,686
Seven of us—

331
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,518
No, no, counting me, that makes eight!

332
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:54,396
Professor, you're an adult,
so it's a given that you'll decline.

333
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,986
What? No way!

334
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,219
So that's one more who can't go!
And we're going to decide who that is now!

335
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,656
What!?

336
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,576
How are you going to pick?

337
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,893
Naturally, by one of the professor's
specialties, a quiz!

338
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,071
Why's that?

339
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,416
Because that would be the most fair!

340
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,586
You kids better not think
that you can get everything for free!

341
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,728
Cheapskate!

342
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,466
Well, I did want to go, too,
but there's no way around it.

343
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,771
So, for the rest of you...
All right, I've got a quiz!

344
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,365
The "Hyper Linear" that you guys
will be the first to board in the world...

345
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,874
Actually, someone's already
been on it before you.

346
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:38,969
Now, of the next three people, who is it?

347
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:42,190
One, Lawyer.

348
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,522
Two, Doctor.

349
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,918
Three, Missionary.

350
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,956
-The question is all too easy.
-You said it.

351
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,741
What? That was quick.

352
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,860
Well, I do want to ride the Linear.

353
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,836
-Sonoko, did you figure it out?
-Not a clue!

354
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,682
Correct!

355
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:04,006
This question is hard!

356
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,618
Hey, give us a hint!

357
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,717
I don't get it at all!

358
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,226
Fine... A hint.

359
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,766
The Hyper Linear, in order to
lift itself up from the track,

360
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,160
uses a really strong magnet called
a "superconductive magnet (chou-dendou)."

361
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:21,566
And when you think of other ways to say
"lawyer," "doctor," and "missionary",

362
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,180
you get "legal expert (houritsuka),"
"physician(isha),"

363
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,098
and "preacher(dendoushi)," right?

364
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,656
Oh, I get it, Professor!

365
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,109
-All right.
-Is the answer...

366
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,666
-Correct!
-All right!

367
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,815
Ran?

368
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,086
Oh, sorry, Sonoko.

369
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,551
Now, there are only three tickets left!

370
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,319
I'm not losing to you brats!

371
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,545
Sonoko-sama here will be the one
boarding the Hyper Linear!

372
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,594
But this is hard.

373
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,726
A missionary is a preacher (dendoushi).

374
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,476
A missionary is a preacher (dendoushi).

375
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,242
A missionary is...

376
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,373
A missionary is...

377
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,106
...a preacher (dendoushi).

378
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,066
Superconductive (Chou-dendou)...

379
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,418
-Oh, I get it!
-Oh, I get it!

380
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,930
The answer is the preacher,
in other words...

381
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:11,002
Number 3, the missionary!

382
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,576
Correct!

383
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,451
Hurray!

384
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,684
We really are so lucky!

385
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,052
Right. Getting to ride the Hyper Linear,
that's so amazing!

386
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:23,086
And we got tons of
these Yaiber goods, too!

387
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,951
Man, I wanna hurry home
and brag to Dad and Mom.

388
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:29,851
Oh, sorry... I forgot my smartphone
at the Professor's house.

389
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,016
It might take a while if I have to
look for it, so go on ahead without me!

390
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,766
Well then, see you later!

391
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,697
-See you later!
-Yeah!

392
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,396
We also have to go meet up
with Sera-chan now, so...

393
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,654
-Okay!
-Later!

394
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:44,233
-Want to go for tapioca again today?
-Sounds good!

395
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:46,848
You need something?

396
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,602
I wanted to go on
a drive with you.

397
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,064
Would you mind coming
with me, little boy?

398
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,705
-Heading out.
-Please do.

399
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,377
WSG TOKYO SPORTS-WATCH GUIDE

400
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:05,036
Sponsors for WSG Tokyo...

401
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,926
that's what they have in common, right?

402
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,923
President Mitsuzuka
who disappeared during a round of golf,

403
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:12,955
and Chairman Suzuki
who was abducted during a party.

404
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,742
And there was a similar case
in the United States, 15 years ago.

405
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,448
Just as I thought!

406
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,738
I see that the FBI is
on the move, after all.

407
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:25,566
I wouldn't expect any less.

408
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,316
I looked it up on the internet.

409
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,446
So 15 years ago in the US,
right before WSG Boston,

410
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,616
there was a series of kidnappings,

411
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,756
all targeting the heads
of corporate sponsors, right?

412
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:39,984
The first one was the head of a
Japanese confectionery maker in Atlanta.

413
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,110
The second was the head of
a financial group in Chicago.

414
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:48,247
The third was the head of
a car manufacturer in Detroit.

415
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,046
Because the cases occurred
in multiple states,

416
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,280
the FBI took charge of the investigation.

417
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:57,615
But the third victim, who managed to
escape his captors on his own,

418
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,446
was shot to death in a station.

419
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:04,788
After that, the first and second victims
were safely released.

420
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,602
But for some reason, they clammed up
concerning the perpetrators,

421
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,156
and refused to cooperate
with the investigation.

422
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,140
I'm told the perp was Japanese?

423
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,956
A man named Makoto Ishihara,
who was a sushi chef in Boston.

424
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,675
He was at the WSG Boston party
attended by all the victims.

425
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:28,457
Furthermore, he was also nearby
when the third victim was shot.

426
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:32,030
And his fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon...

427
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,364
A gun that was found at a later time.

428
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:39,886
However, once the FBI arrested him,
Ishihara denied any wrongdoing.

429
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,232
What? I heard that his motive was to

430
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:46,474
protest the commercialization
of the WSG via a terrorist attack.

431
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:49,227
Because the companies
whose leaders were abducted

432
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,706
all dropped their WSG sponsorship
soon afterwards,

433
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,429
that's what people were led to believe.

434
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,445
The companies that dropped
their sponsorships

435
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,741
were censured all over the United States.

436
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,956
Well, they are unforgiving
towards people who cave in to terrorists.

437
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,306
Also, when I looked up who was the head
of the FBI back then, it was this guy.

438
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,406
You know who this is, right Subaru-san?

439
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,006
Alan MacKenzie.

440
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,388
A man people say will be
the next president.

441
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,733
Right. He's now the chairman
of the WSG Association,

442
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,516
and will arrive in Japan shortly.

443
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,052
That bother you?

444
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:28,030
I mean, there was a similar case
in the States 11 years ago, right?

445
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,419
Yeah, a copycat of the crime
from 15 years ago.

446
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:37,163
When I looked that one up, it was also during
Alan-san's time as FBI director.

447
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:42,837
But the FBI arrested the perpetrator for
that one before there were any deaths.

448
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,626
The perp admitted that he'd mimicked
the crime from four years before,

449
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,799
and also gave up his accomplices.

450
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:51,658
The FBI believes that
that copycat criminal

451
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:54,606
has reappeared in Tokyo now.

452
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,926
True, once again, the first victim was
the head of a confectionery maker.

453
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,286
The second was also
the head of a financial group.

454
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,332
It's exactly the same as 15 years ago.

455
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:11,144
Meaning the third target will be
the head of a car manufacturer, huh?

456
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,088
Thank you, little boy.

457
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,180
MORI DETECTIVE AGENCY

458
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,897
A client for Dad?

459
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,876
Huh? I've seen that guy somewhere...

460
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,796
JOHN VOIT, CODE JAPAN
PRESIDENT AND CEO

461
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,760
Mr. John Voit is the president and CEO
of Code Japan.

462
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:40,386
He's a famous man
who's been all over the news lately.

463
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,365
Oh, so Dad was meeting someone important!

464
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,274
-But what does he want from...
-Code Japan, huh.

465
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:50,101
Back when Takara Motors was
going bankrupt, they decided to become

466
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,159
a subsidiary of
the British car maker Code...

467
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:59,455
Is he the one they'll be going after next?

468
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,026
I'm home!

469
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,849
-Masumi, it came.
-What did?

470
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:11,746
The Linear that the target will be
boarding.

471
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,706
That's my mom!

472
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,256
Actually, I just heard this from Ran-kun,

473
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,080
but it seems like Conan-kun
will be on this train as well.

474
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,702
That little boy?

475
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,151
Oh, it's Kichi-nii.

476
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:27,226
Hey Kichi-nii, what's up?

477
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,535
I'll be heading over to Nagoya for work
on July 24th.

478
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,026
So I was wondering
what you wanted as a souvenir!

479
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,151
What? Kichi-nii, you're gonna be
in Nagoya that day, too?

480
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,446
You too, Masumi?

481
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,180
Then, since we'll both be there,
let's meet up in Nagoya!

482
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:44,212
Oh, uh, I'll give you a call
when I get to Nagoya, okay?

483
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,518
-I'm hanging up now!
-I have no time to see you in Nagoya!

484
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,069
Jeez... Kichi-nii!

485
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,272
You can't park here.

486
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,113
I'm sorr— Oh! Yumi—

487
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,046
Just as you'd expect
from the Taiko Meijin,

488
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,226
there you are like the real Hideyoshi,

489
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,754
cheating on me over the phone
with your new woman, you bald rat!

490
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:07,106
I-I wasn't!

491
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,408
Then who were you calling that you had to
hang up the second you saw me?

492
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:13,776
Fine.

493
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,792
I'll introduce them to you properly, Yumi-tan.

494
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,474
Dinner's ready!

495
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:23,902
-Okay!
-Yeah!

496
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,697
Time to eat!

497
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,593
These pork cutlets are tasty!

498
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,786
Ran-neechan, can I turn on the TV?

499
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,005
-Sure.
-Yay!

500
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,296
All eyes on the next story, everyone!

501
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,006
It's about the Hyper Linear!

502
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,714
It's finally been completed.

503
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:43,426
Conan-kun, don't just watch TV.
Eat your dinner, okay?

504
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,320
Not only that, but it can reach a top
speed of up to 1,000 km/hour!

505
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:48,666
It's really in another dimension speed-wise!
(1 MONTH UNTIL LINEAR OPENS PUBLIC TEST RUN)

506
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,902
And because the speed is comparable to
a bullet being fired from a gun,

507
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:52,806
NIPPON-NO-DANGAN

508
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,638
the world has dubbed it the
"Japanese Bullet".

509
00:27:57,286 --> 00:28:00,536
So amazing. We're gonna be riding on that.

510
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,576
Dad, are you all right?

511
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,963
Ran, you stay seated!

512
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:07,696
Hey, kid, turn off the TV!

513
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,040
Oh, okay.

514
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:12,690
Are you guys riding the Hyper Linear?

515
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,383
What if we are?

516
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:16,336
Never mind that! Take off your shirt!

517
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,836
When are you riding it?

518
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,586
Oh, come on now!

519
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,030
The day of the inaugural run.
The opening day of WSG Tokyo.

520
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:25,070
What?

521
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,812
Raise your arms, Dad!

522
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:29,501
It was actually hot, wasn't it?

523
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:32,330
There's no need for you to act tough
and pretend like it wasn't, okay?

524
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:34,043
I'm sorry I made a mess.

525
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,066
-Hey, Pops.
-What?

526
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,526
Is that the same Hyper Linear that
John-san will be boarding, by any chance?

527
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:45,844
Among those who will be on board that day
are the WSG Tokyo sponsors here today,

528
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,772
That's why John-san came here
to ask for your help. Am I right?

529
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,299
Hey, what's going on?

530
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:58,126
Pops, my friends are going on
the Hyper Linear, too.

531
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,101
If something dangerous is about to happen...

532
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,692
No, it shouldn't end up turning into
that dangerous an incident!

533
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:05,176
At least, I don't think so.

534
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,371
Well, the two that were kidnapped
came back safely, I hear...

535
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:13,564
So this time around, they might try to
abduct John-san aboard the Hyper Linear?

536
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:14,473
What?

537
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:16,476
That's a big deal!
We have to tell the police!

538
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,995
Hold up! That was who I promised
my client I wouldn't tell!

539
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,710
We can't afford not to!

540
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:25,656
Those two may have been kidnapped
because of President John!

541
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,032
That's...

542
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,127
He said so himself.

543
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:34,142
He got drunk at a bar, and might have
let slip to the male patron next to him...

544
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,826
that he was playing golf
with President Mitsuzuka,

545
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,360
and that Chairman Suzuki was
attending that party the other day.

546
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:44,466
If something like that ever got out,

547
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,111
he couldn't avoid
sullying his company's image.

548
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:49,096
Sullying its image?

549
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,977
Nowadays, complete strangers
can band together and drive others

550
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,388
to desperation with no vested stakes.

551
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:56,370
So that's why he requested your assistance?

552
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:00,096
Yeah, to investigate whether
it's really his fault.

553
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,856
And to keep quiet about it
to the police until it was all clear.

554
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,316
I'm gonna go wash up.

555
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,312
Sorry about the miso soup.

556
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,374
I'll make some more!

557
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,276
Conan-kun, we have to stop the kids
from getting on the Linear!

558
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,222
Yeah.

559
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:19,862
But they were so happy about it.
Could there be any other way?

560
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,496
Masked Yaiber!

561
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,586
WSG ASSOCIATION BUILDING

562
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,370
Thank you for coming today.

563
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:36,226
We will now start the briefing
for the Hyper Linear Trial Ride,

564
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,551
-and the WSG Tokyo Opening Ceremonies.
-Look at this crowd!

565
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,796
Because people applied from all over
Japan to be here!

566
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,316
We're so lucky!

567
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,896
HYPER LINEAR LINER TEST RIDE AND
WSG TOKYO OPENING CEREMONIES SCHEDULE AND PRESENTATION

568
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,736
Allow us to introduce ourselves!

569
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,556
I am Maiko Shirahato, the publicity
director for WSG Association Japan.

570
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,116
PUBLICITY DIRECTOR, WSG ASSOCIATION JAPAN
MAIKO SHIRAHATO

571
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,786
I will be your guide for the opening
ceremonies.

572
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,956
What?

573
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,626
Isn't Shirahato that pharmaceutical company
where your father worked, Haibara-san?

574
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,546
That was Shirohato Pharmaceuticals.
Not Shirahato.

575
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,086
So I don't think
they're related in any way.

576
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:13,136
I-I am the chief development engineer
for the Hyper Linear, Osamu Inoue.

577
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,245
Um, how can I make it easy for you
to remember my name?

578
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:17,385
CHIEF DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER, HYPER LINEAR LINER
OSAMU INOUE

579
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,976
Since I'm Osamu Inoue...

580
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,936
Inoue-san, please move on!

581
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,226
Oh, okay...

582
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,895
I'm the one who programs the train
to run safely, and during the trial ride,

583
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,656
I'll be explaining the technical
aspects of the Hyper Linear to you.

584
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,136
-Also—
-Okay! That's it!

585
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,692
And finally, you have me!

586
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:38,441
Cabin attendant for the Hyper Linear,
the idol of the Hyper Linear staff!

587
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,936
I'm Ellie Ishioka!

588
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,313
ELLIE ISHIOKA
CHIEF CABIN ATTENDANT, HYPER LINEAR LINER

589
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:47,613
You can remember "Ellie Ishioka" with
a simple "welcome back", oka-eri!

590
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,506
But what about
the "ishi" part of her name?

591
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,386
Leave it to Ellie-san.

592
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,426
She knows how to sell herself.

593
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,822
Yes.

594
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,348
Next, I will explain the schedule
for the actual day.

595
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:05,225
At 10 a.m. on July 24, you will all gather
at the Nagoya International Airport!

596
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,026
Our destination will be Shibahama Stadium,

597
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,176
where WSG Tokyo's opening ceremonies
will be held.

598
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,992
SHIBAHAMA STADIUM

599
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,946
Since it's a trial ride from
Shin-Nagoya Station to Shibahama Station

600
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,746
in Tokyo, we'll be departing from Nagoya.

601
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,456
And at Nagoya International Airport,

602
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,086
we will meet up with the WSG committee
members and sponsors.

603
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,480
When all Hyper Linear passengers
have gathered,

604
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:32,195
we will start with a health
check at the airport hospital!

605
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:34,296
As you will be the first people
in the world to...

606
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,450
Hey, Conan-kun, this means that

607
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:39,205
the sponsors will also be checked
for their health, right?

608
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:40,311
I think so.

609
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,226
After that, it looks like
we'll be together

610
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,482
all the way from the airport
to Shibahama Stadium.

611
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:48,461
That means the Linear may not be the only
place where they'll go after John-san.

612
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:49,380
Yeah.

613
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:52,236
We'll have to be on our toes
at the airport and in the stadium, too.

614
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,696
Wait, Conan-kun, don't tell me
you're coming along?

615
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,443
-Of course I'm going.
-You absolutely can't!

616
00:32:57,467 --> 00:33:01,406
I asked Sonoko to get
five of those tickets!

617
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,701
But I want to go on the Hyper Linear.

618
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,396
Back when he was a student,

619
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,588
ALAN MACKENZIE
WSG TORONTO PARTICIPATION PHOTO

620
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,876
he participated in WSG Toronto
as an athlete in shooting!

621
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,168
Shooting?

622
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:13,857
He was also the former director
of the FBI, right?

623
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,426
Alan-san became president

624
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,466
of the International WSG Association
seven years ago.

625
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:24,684
Seven years ago... Wasn't that the year
that Tokyo was named WSG host city?

626
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,975
That's correct!

627
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:30,880
Doesn't this link between President Alan
and WSG Tokyo feel like destiny?

628
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:32,839
There's one more thing!

629
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:36,415
Everyone, please take a look at
this model of the Hyper Linear!

630
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:40,633
Just before the Linear arrives
at Shibahama Station,

631
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:44,530
it will eject a surprise effect where
flags of all nations fly out like this!

632
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:46,811
That's another idea of President Alan's!

633
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:48,626
Hold it, Ellie-san!

634
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,376
You weren't supposed to mention that!

635
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,644
It's no longer a surprise now!

636
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,402
And, well...

637
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:57,150
So please pretend
you didn't hear any of that!

638
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,886
P-Please don't tweet about it
or anything, okay?

639
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,612
Now, please take a look at the pamphlet
we handed out at the entrance.

640
00:34:05,636 --> 00:34:07,225
We'll go over the rest of the schedule
for the actual day, as well as

641
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:08,005
THE STORY BEGINS,
HYPER LINEAR LINER

642
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:10,893
seat assignments aboard the Hyper Linear.

643
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,960
I see.

644
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,734
It looks pretty tough
for us to infiltrate.

645
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,146
You guys are pretty enthusiastic
for a case happening in Japan.

646
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,211
If there's a copycat of a case
that the FBI solved,

647
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,117
we need to be the ones to capture them.

648
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,949
We have authorization
from FBI headquarters,

649
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:30,916
for the sniper bullet
requested by Akai-san.

650
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,046
Sniper... Don't tell me you guys are
planning on killing the perp?

651
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,249
Conan-kun.

652
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,843
The FBI has its own ways
of dealing with things.

653
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:42,445
-All right!
-All right!

654
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,176
-Yaiber Show!
-Yaiber Show!

655
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,396
-Let us go to the Yaiber Show!
-Good thing they jumped ship so easily

656
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,326
-from the Hyper Linear to Yaiber.
-Yeah.

657
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,394
But she's still headed to Nagoya.

658
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:56,396
"She"?

659
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,631
Ran-neechan from the detective agency.

660
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:01,260
Y-Yeah...

661
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:03,721
Wait, Shinichi,
how did you know about that?

662
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,576
Oh, you heard from Conan-kun again,
didn't you?

663
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,327
In any case, you shouldn't go.
I'll protect your dad for you.

664
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:12,844
Protect?

665
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:14,757
So Shinichi, you're set on
going to Nagoya.

666
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,331
In that case, I'm going, too!

667
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:17,336
Hey, Ran!

668
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,650
It'll be all right.

669
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:22,298
You'll just be
one more person for me to protect.

670
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:23,914
You've got it wrong!

671
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:26,345
Protecting you is my—

672
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:29,435
Your what?

673
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,396
I-In any case, you shouldn't be going!

674
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,300
Hey, wait. Shinichi?

675
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,986
Idiot.

676
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,907
Don't make me say it.

677
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,182
NAGOYA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

678
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,312
Everyone boarding the Hyper Linear,

679
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:57,966
thank you for allowing us to
take attendance.

680
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,781
And we've been informed that
the sponsors have just arrived.

681
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:08,719
That back...

682
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:10,270
It's Ran, isn't it?

683
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:15,204
Hey, Ran! I told you not to come!

684
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:18,986
I mean, there's no way you can protect
John-san by yourself, Dad.

685
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,800
I don't need your help!

686
00:36:20,824 --> 00:36:23,446
President John has hired
his own SPs as well!

687
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,672
And you even brought the kids with you!

688
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,746
Conan-kun and Ai-chan!
So you're here, too?

689
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,190
Well, Haibara insisted on coming.

690
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,930
I have no interest in Masked Yaiber.

691
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,060
I hear a faint voice calling for me!

692
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:45,216
Everyone, let's say it
all together this time.

693
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,596
Here goes!

694
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,445
-Help us, Masked Yaiber!
-Help us, Masked Yaiber!

695
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,750
I have accepted all of your feelings!

696
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:58,576
Masked Yaiber is here!

697
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,446
He's so awesome!

698
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,201
And look at me, chaperoning the kids...

699
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,922
Conan-kun?!

700
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:16,786
Look out!

701
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,847
He's just a child. Nothing to worry about.

702
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,632
Are you all right, boy?

703
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:21,852
Y-Yeah...

704
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:25,426
I saw a slope, and I couldn't stop
myself from running down it!

705
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,999
-You didn't hurt yourself, did you?
-Nope!

706
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:29,099
Mister, your Japanese is really good!

707
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,676
Yes. I've been here in Japan
for a long time, you see.

708
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,465
-Oh, I see!
-Hey, kid!

709
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:37,859
Didn't they teach you at school
not to run down the hallway?

710
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,316
I'm so sorry, he's an acquaintance's kid...

711
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,236
Ran, make sure you keep an eye on him!

712
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,662
-Hey!
-Now, let's get going!

713
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,976
Hey, Conan-kun... You're big enough to
make it home with Ai-chan now, aren't you?

714
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,038
Huh? That's impossible. I'm just a kid.

715
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,690
But... Ai-chan, you're big enough
to head home, right?

716
00:37:56,714 --> 00:38:00,656
I can't make it home. I'm just a kid.

717
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,369
Let's hurry on in.

718
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:05,585
We're the very last ones now.

719
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:07,716
R-Right.

720
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,160
INCOMING CALL
SUBARU OKIYA

721
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,853
I just landed at
Nagoya International Airport.

722
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,547
And I have
a certain request for you, my boy.

723
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,146
Got it.

724
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,840
If worse comes to worst,
I'll give it a shot.

725
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:27,636
Who are you talking to?

726
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,696
Haibara.

727
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,626
It's Genta! He's saying
the Yaiber show is really fun!

728
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,784
I see.

729
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:34,746
Everyone else is waiting for you.

730
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,206
I'll be right over, so go on ahead.

731
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,436
You'll get lost, so hurry over.

732
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,737
Yeah!

733
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:44,194
Hello?

734
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:46,176
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

735
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,782
Anyway, did you look into my request?

736
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,084
Of course.

737
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:52,214
According to FBI records,

738
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:56,226
Ishihara was incarcerated
and then passed away.

739
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,056
Huh? Ishihara had been
denying the charges, right?

740
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,226
According to the memoirs
of the FBI director at the time,

741
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,156
he'd been proclaiming
his innocence the whole time.

742
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,424
The FBI director back then was...

743
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,680
-President Alan.
-President Alan.

744
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,496
What are the chances
that Ishihara was falsely accused?

745
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,620
None... or so I'd like to believe.

746
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:21,280
Also, Ishihara had a wife and a daughter.

747
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:22,916
He had a family!?

748
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,756
After he died in prison,
his wife and daughter returned to Japan.

749
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,605
Their names are...

750
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:33,506
Got it. I'll check the guest roster.

751
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,330
I'm sure Pops has one.

752
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:43,016
President Alan has arrived!

753
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,814
ALAN MACKENZIE (64)
INTERNATIONAL WSG ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT

754
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,527
Everyone, please greet him with
a large round of applause!

755
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:54,903
That was quick.

756
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:57,994
So, how was it?

757
00:39:58,018 --> 00:39:59,571
They weren't on the roster.

758
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:00,876
I see.

759
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,931
Well, there is the possibility
that they changed their names

760
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,296
under the witness protection program.

761
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,610
Ishihara was the perp, right?

762
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:11,551
Would his family be candidates
for the witness protection program?

763
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,815
Anyone can enter it
if there's the possibility

764
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,780
that the perp's accomplices
could assault them.

765
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:18,546
After all, it's a plea bargain
to force them

766
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:22,629
to assist with the investigation
by assuring their safety.

767
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:26,813
Can you check if Ishihara or his daughter
were in the program or not?

768
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:29,994
If the FBI was responsible for
the witness protection,

769
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,718
we'd see it right away,

770
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:36,306
but if the USMS handled it,
it will take a little time.

771
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,836
Huh? Why?

772
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:43,604
The FBI and the USMS
aren't exactly friends.

773
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:45,279
I-I see...

774
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:48,884
By the way, when you're changing names
under witness protection,

775
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,296
can you change it to whatever you want?

776
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,926
That would be difficult.

777
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,884
-Are you absolutely sure?
-Conan-kun?

778
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:58,740
You might be able to if there was little risk
of your previous name being identified.

779
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:00,230
-Where did he go?
-I see...

780
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,596
Ise will hold Tsu.

781
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,955
Tsu will hold Ise.

782
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,951
Owari-Nagoya will be held by the fort...

783
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:14,292
Nothing less from one of the three
famous castles of Japan.

784
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:17,559
Stop mouthing off
with that smug look on your face!

785
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,076
Yumi-tan!

786
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,145
I was going to go pick you up
once you arrived at Nagoya station.

787
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,246
I'm surprised that you figured out
I was here.

788
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,036
Of course I'd know.

789
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,376
You're a celebrity!
(Taiko Meijin spotted!)

790
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,836
Hey, that's me!

791
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,964
More like, what do you mean that
we're meeting up for a date in Nagoya!?

792
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:36,346
I had work over here today.

793
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,436
Jeez, you should've told me
you'd be wearing a kimono!

794
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,936
I would have coordinated
my clothes accordingly.

795
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,766
I-I'm sorry.

796
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,864
Anyway, are you done with work?

797
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:49,721
Yeah. Today I'm just scouting.

798
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:51,078
Now, look here.

799
00:41:51,102 --> 00:41:54,486
Isn't it amazing that we'll be playing
in a place like this,

800
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,533
overlooking Nagoya Castle?

801
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,096
-Playing?
-I didn't tell you?

802
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,021
PLANNED CONSTRUCTION SITE
FOR NAGOYA SHOGI HALL

803
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:00,719
This is where they're building the
Nagoya Shogi Hall.

804
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:04,890
Oh yeah, you said you were on the
executive committee for its construction.

805
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:07,539
Yeah. I volunteered myself.

806
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,718
You really are a fanboy!

807
00:42:09,743 --> 00:42:11,956
I couldn't let any other
shogi players do it.

808
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,966
What?

809
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,424
If you get dragged about everywhere
to secure funding,

810
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:18,716
there'll be no time left to play shogi.

811
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,489
I'm the only one
that needs to feel that pain.

812
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,871
Chukichi...

813
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,300
NAGOYA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HOSPITAL

814
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,417
The simple checkups we will be doing
now will be held in a coed room.

815
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:45,978
We will now show you to the exam room
on the second floor, so please follow us.

816
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,809
-What's wrong?
-It feels like we're being watched.

817
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,177
I'm working today, so I have to make sure
my cover's not blown.

818
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,306
Okay, your blood pressure is normal.

819
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,283
-Next. Mr. MacKenzie!
-Yes.

820
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,270
Oops.

821
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,191
That's an energy drink, right?

822
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:15,987
Looks like it.

823
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,736
Here you go, Alan-san.

824
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,466
Oh, thank you.

825
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:23,406
I just bought it at the airport.
I haven't slept for a day.

826
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,326
If I fell asleep during the ceremony,
it'd be a mess.

827
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,366
Both of you understand English?!

828
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,126
Just a little, because there are
classes at school.

829
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,570
Same here.

830
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,199
What the?

831
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:49,056
Everyone, please calm down!

832
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,868
Please don't panic!
Please evacuate outside without running!

833
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:55,566
Someone help us!

834
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,740
Darn it, this door won't budge!

835
00:43:57,764 --> 00:44:00,526
Is this a plot to take my life?

836
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,023
Don't worry! We will protect you!

837
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,959
-Dad! I'll go look for a way out!
-Hey, Ran!

838
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,576
Ran-neechan! Answer me!

839
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,206
-Ran-ne—
-Edogawa-kun!

840
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,046
This is no explosion!

841
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,338
-It's a quench!
-Quench?

842
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:22,822
Edogawa-kun, hurry up and escape...

843
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:25,849
Hey! Haibara!

844
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,489
Hurry and escape...

845
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:34,610
At this rate, everyone is sure to die.

846
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,803
Haibara? Hey, Haibara!

847
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:39,716
Stay with me, Haibara!

848
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,995
Haibara!

849
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,087
Sh-Shinichi?

850
00:44:46,388 --> 00:44:48,812
Ran!? Are you okay?

851
00:44:50,183 --> 00:44:51,440
Hey!

852
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:56,486
M-My body won't move...

853
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:02,025
Wh-What in the world is going on...

854
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:10,741
Hello? What's wrong, little boy?

855
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,081
Who is it!?

856
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:44,648
What happened here?!

857
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,680
What a mess we're in! How shameful!

858
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,290
I couldn't help it.

859
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:52,522
I was about to collide with a car
that came out of nowhere!

860
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,896
But we're fine.

861
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,292
This is the only road from the airport
leading to the urban district.

862
00:45:58,358 --> 00:45:59,280
INCOMING CALL
KICHI-NII

863
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:02,236
She hung up on me. Why?

864
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,154
There you are, Chukichi!

865
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,079
Who have you been calling
for the past few minutes?

866
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,882
My family.

867
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:14,598
I wanted to introduce you
as the woman I have been dating.

868
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:17,603
But maybe they still aren't
ready to accept you yet.

869
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:21,546
I told my mother that there was someone
I wanted to propose to

870
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,466
once I won every shogi title out there.

871
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,549
One or two titles shouldn't matter.

872
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:30,636
You have the best title out there, anyway.

873
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,881
This one, named Yumi Miyamoto-sama!

874
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:37,269
Yumi-san...

875
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:41,352
Wait, Yumi-tan, are you drunk?

876
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,476
Not at all!

877
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,148
-Come on, back to the store!
-Look out, Yumi-tan!

878
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:49,236
Are you in pain anywhere?

879
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,041
-No, I'm fine.
-Where are you, Ran!

880
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:52,277
Ran!

881
00:46:53,765 --> 00:46:55,100
Ran!

882
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,956
Shinichi?

883
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,504
I'm not Shinichi! It's me!

884
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:02,176
Dad...

885
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,543
Where are Conan-kun and Ai-chan?

886
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,376
They're still passed out.

887
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,487
I'm going to check on President John's
condition now, so wake them up for me.

888
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,496
Conan-kun!

889
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:16,936
Ran!

890
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,630
Neechan... Are you okay?

891
00:47:19,654 --> 00:47:22,604
Yeah, looks like I'm perfectly fine.
What about you, Conan-kun?

892
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:25,379
He's not here! President John is gone!

893
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:29,446
It's not like he woke up before us
and he's already being examined?

894
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,484
-I don't know!
-All right!

895
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:32,842
The transmitter I put on John-san
still works!

896
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,657
Ran-neechan, take care of Haibara!

897
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:36,678
-Where are you going?
-Bathroom!

898
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,610
NAGOYA

899
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:52,046
Little boy, what happened?

900
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,059
I got roped into trouble at the hospital...
(CONAN EDOGAWA)

901
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,226
It's fine as long as you're okay.

902
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,266
But John-san has been kidnapped.

903
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,127
What?

904
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:01,016
Following the transmitter's signals,

905
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,274
John-san has gone through the only path
out of the airport,

906
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,606
and is likely heading east
on Triton Bridge...

907
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,310
-Can you pursue him?
-Yeah...

908
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:10,808
Static?

909
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:15,690
Which way did it head from here?

910
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:21,126
Follow that red car!

911
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,903
-Why?
-Just hurry up and do it!

912
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:39,431
That motorcycle and helmet... It can't be...

913
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,106
Who is that exactly?

914
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,001
It doesn't matter. Don't let him get away!

915
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,249
Got it!

916
00:48:58,006 --> 00:49:00,245
Don't tell me it's busted now?

917
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,026
Look out!

918
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,650
Darn it!

919
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,444
That was close!

920
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,069
Haibara! Are you awake, Haibara?!

921
00:49:19,093 --> 00:49:21,806
Ran-neechan woke me up.

922
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,596
I'm glad you're okay! Actually—

923
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,896
Hold on, let me move over a bit.

924
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,276
No good! John-san's cellphone
has been powered down.

925
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,876
Where are you?

926
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,106
My glasses broke!

927
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,558
Maybe it broke when you collapsed
because of the quench earlier?

928
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:39,156
I need you to confirm John-san
location right away.

929
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,761
Location, you say...

930
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:44,068
How did you know that I brought
a spare pair of glasses with me?

931
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:46,974
I mean, you're always prepared and stuff.

932
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:50,120
Hold on just a second.

933
00:49:50,144 --> 00:49:51,732
I'm counting on you, Haibara!

934
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,687
What was that explosion earlier?
(NURSE STATION)

935
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:56,759
-Please calm down!
-Excuse me!

936
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:58,668
There's a possibility that a
quench has occurred!

937
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:00,716
Please call an MRI technician right away!

938
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,136
O-Okay!

939
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:04,724
MRI Technician, Takahashi-san...

940
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,646
John-san has entered the main island,

941
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,212
and is heading south
from around the Tokai Interchange!

942
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:11,187
At this speed, it must be
either a car or a motorcycle.

943
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,004
MRI room, stat!

944
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,962
Subaru-san, John-san is currently—

945
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:23,826
I heard it. The Tokai Industrial Complex!

946
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:28,843
Found it!

947
00:50:33,982 --> 00:50:35,630
Haibara! Where is John-san?

948
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:39,806
Right now, he's stopped near
the Tokai Industrial Complex.

949
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,536
I'm going to enter the MRI room now.

950
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,686
The magnetism inside
may cause abnormalities

951
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,493
in electronics like these glasses.

952
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:49,988
Well, if it was a quench,
I think I'll be okay.

953
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:52,488
So what is this "quench" thing, anyway!?

954
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:56,010
Oh, even our great detective doesn't
know what a quench is?

955
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:57,526
Well, excuse me!

956
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,670
Then, let me tell you.

957
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:03,186
MRI uses superconductive magnets.
(SUPERCONDUCTIVE MAGNET)

958
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,373
They use liquid helium to keep its
temperature low.

959
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,611
LIQUID HELIUM

960
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:10,457
But if that temperature goes up
for one reason or another,

961
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,590
it explosively evaporates.

962
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:14,147
So that's what a quench is!

963
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,506
Right.

964
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,870
If a quench happens, the helium gas
quickly lowers the oxygen concentration,

965
00:51:19,894 --> 00:51:22,376
so it can be life-threatening
in a matter of minutes.

966
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,266
But there are safety measures to prevent
something like that from happening...

967
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,686
So why?

968
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,048
It's an IV stand that isn't suitable
for use near an MRI.

969
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:33,731
The emergency shut-off button
has been pressed, too!

970
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,026
What does that mean?

971
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,696
I believe something like this got stuck
to the MRI's superconductive magnet,

972
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,696
and someone panic-pressed
the emergency shut-off button,

973
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,616
causing the quench to happen.

974
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,406
But normally all piping in the hospital
is supposed to close

975
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,206
when the emergency shut-off button
is pressed, right?

976
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,763
What? That's right.

977
00:51:51,787 --> 00:51:54,980
When it detects smoke,
the internal piping closes,

978
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:57,507
and only the pipes leading outside
should be open.

979
00:51:57,898 --> 00:52:00,240
But then, why did it?

980
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:03,950
Where to?

981
00:52:03,974 --> 00:52:05,975
Please come to the control room!

982
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:10,936
The pipes leading to the second floor
have been set to stay open,

983
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,836
and the ventilation has been
set to work at full throttle!

984
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,736
Did you hear that?

985
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,930
That's why the smoke
that filled the second floor

986
00:52:17,954 --> 00:52:19,326
was ventilated out immediately,

987
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,093
and we were spared from
oxygen deprivation.

988
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:26,132
-So the perp did that on purpose?
-Probably.

989
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,629
If so, this perp has no intention
of killing anyone.

990
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:31,052
I see!

991
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:34,962
So that's why they left their abduction
targets where they could be found easily.

992
00:52:37,132 --> 00:52:39,269
I've arrived at Tokai Industrial Complex.

993
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:42,635
Where is the target?

994
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,530
He should be close by.
John-san isn't moving right now.

995
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:17,752
That motorcycle again!

996
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:48,430
This feels like...

997
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:50,243
Jeet Kune Do!

998
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,855
Who in the world are you?

999
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:04,753
H-He's strong!

1000
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:07,259
At this rate, I'm going to be taken out!

1001
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:15,163
This kid...! It can't be!

1002
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,083
So it is you, Masumi!

1003
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,142
Where are you, Subaru-san?

1004
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:33,491
That's a disguise, isn't it?

1005
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Who in the world are you?

1006
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:37,787
Sera-no-neechan!

1007
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,046
Conan-kun!

1008
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,243
What are you doing here?

1009
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:43,294
Huh? Oh... There's someone I'm looking for.

1010
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:45,458
All the way out here
in a factory like this?

1011
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,660
I have my reasons.

1012
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,620
SENDER: M
SUBJECT: GO AHEAD.

1013
00:54:56,906 --> 00:55:00,583
It won't do for me
to see that child right now.

1014
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,397
Got it, Mom.

1015
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:04,116
Sera-no-neechan!

1016
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,323
That person you're looking for...
Would it be John-san?

1017
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:10,803
You really are sharp.

1018
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:12,406
That's right.

1019
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,298
I know where John-san is right now.

1020
00:55:14,322 --> 00:55:15,786
-What?
-Follow me!

1021
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,283
Hey, wait!

1022
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:22,479
So what brought you here?

1023
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:25,299
I saw it in the hospital lobby.

1024
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,808
What just happened?

1025
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:34,806
That cart was calmly moving along
while everything around it was in a panic

1026
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,206
from the explosion.

1027
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,936
Did you see the driver's face?

1028
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,460
It was very brief,
so I didn't get a good look,

1029
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:41,393
but from the physique, it was a man.

1030
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,331
The perp is male...

1031
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,436
Right there!

1032
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,698
John-san's transmitter is
right around there!

1033
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,914
John Voit is somewhere around here!?

1034
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:56,871
The perp left the targets
where they'd be easily found.

1035
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,416
It's likely the same story
this time around, too.

1036
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,509
I'm going to try calling
John-san's cellphone.

1037
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:03,520
You know his number?

1038
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:04,610
Well, yeah.

1039
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:08,562
By the way, I heard that John-san's
phone's turned off right now.

1040
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:12,471
No, if the perp is the kind of guy
I think he is...

1041
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:17,553
I hear it... Where is it?

1042
00:56:22,263 --> 00:56:23,395
I know.

1043
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,818
He's above us!

1044
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,250
Okay!

1045
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,470
Found him!

1046
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:35,001
Why would they leave him
in such a conspicuous place?

1047
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:39,845
Because the perp had
no intention of killing John-san.

1048
00:56:40,457 --> 00:56:42,958
Time to eat!

1049
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:46,046
So tasty!

1050
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,354
After all, if you're in Nagoya,
you really gotta eat some hitsumabushi!

1051
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:50,796
Dad!

1052
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,367
Shinichi just called and said
they found John-san!

1053
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:58,306
Why is that detective boy calling
about something like that?

1054
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,013
I don't care!
Just tell the people in charge!

1055
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,356
You keep an eye on that hitsumabushi!
It's mine!

1056
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,066
Yeah, yeah...

1057
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,526
Thanks, Shinichi.
Yeah, we're fine over here.

1058
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,348
Sheesh, you really should contact me, too.

1059
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,434
John-san, do you remember anything
about when you were abducted?

1060
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:23,826
When it happened...

1061
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:29,297
I was suddenly engulfed in white smoke,
and I couldn't breathe, but...

1062
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,086
When I came to briefly,
I was inside a car...

1063
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,386
It felt like there was someone next to me...

1064
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,216
Was that the perp?

1065
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,619
I don't know...

1066
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:41,320
Was it a man or a woman?

1067
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:43,973
I don't know.

1068
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:47,604
So we can't board the Linear?

1069
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:48,726
Why?

1070
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,736
But our test results showed nothing wrong!

1071
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,570
I know, but we can't have
another incident like before,

1072
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,696
-Man, that was tasty.
-Yeah, it was delicious.

1073
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,954
So they decided that it would be better
to return to Tokyo using the bullet trains.

1074
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,526
-What?
-Ellie-san is in trouble!

1075
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,496
-I should take a firm stand and—
-Ellie-san! Inoue-san!

1076
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,060
Is President Alan here, by any chance?

1077
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:08,024
I haven't seen him.

1078
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:09,166
Nor I.

1079
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,836
I searched the hospital
and the conference room too...

1080
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,065
President Alan is nowhere to be found!

1081
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,660
AICHI

1082
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:18,431
You're the one that called 110?

1083
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:20,162
I am, but you're so late!

1084
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:21,444
I'm sorry.

1085
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:24,726
There was an explosion at the airport, so
most of the Nagoya police are out there,

1086
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,503
leaving us short-handed.

1087
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:29,826
In any case, just get him to a hospital!

1088
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,696
I'm really glad you guys helped me out.

1089
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,870
Thank you.

1090
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:38,615
-No problem!
-Take care of yourself, John-san!

1091
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,386
Mission accomplished!

1092
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:48,980
We were able to protect
the VIP from England...

1093
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,986
Good job, Masumi.

1094
00:58:53,376 --> 00:58:55,928
They've decided to send us home
on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.

1095
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:58,492
Huh? The Linear isn't running after all?

1096
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:00,966
It looks like it's going to
depart from the station

1097
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,838
in time for the opening ceremonies

1098
00:59:02,862 --> 00:59:04,477
without anyone on board.

1099
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:06,059
Without anyone on board?

1100
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:08,496
Because the Linear runs autonomously.

1101
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,962
But enough about that.

1102
00:59:09,986 --> 00:59:11,751
President Alan is missing.

1103
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,702
That "someone else in the car"
that John-san mentioned just now...

1104
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:18,916
It might have been President Alan.

1105
00:59:21,364 --> 00:59:23,669
Hold on a sec!
I'm gonna make a phone call!

1106
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,126
Oh, sure.

1107
00:59:25,915 --> 00:59:28,706
I found the perp's car, little boy.

1108
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,960
It's in the airport parking lot.

1109
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:35,833
The only thing we were able to find out
was that the driver is likely to be male.

1110
00:59:35,857 --> 00:59:38,740
The perp is a male, after all?

1111
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:44,726
The FBI director back then was...

1112
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,980
Hello, everyone in Japan.

1113
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:50,494
What are the chances
that Ishihara was falsely accused?

1114
00:59:59,507 --> 01:00:02,685
Akai-san, it looks like worse...

1115
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,717
has come to worst.

1116
01:00:06,364 --> 01:00:09,079
Head over to Shin-Nagoya Station
right away!

1117
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,255
Yeah...

1118
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,261
Roger that.

1119
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:25,737
Sera-no-neechan! To Shin-Nagoya station!

1120
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:27,056
-What?
-Hurry!

1121
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,386
What's wrong?

1122
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:31,880
You know how he said that most cops
in this jurisdiction are concentrated

1123
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:34,227
at the airport because the perp
caused that quench?

1124
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:35,071
I get it!

1125
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:37,356
The security at the station is
stretched a bit thin!

1126
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,487
Right!

1127
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:40,526
Fifteen years ago...

1128
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,415
WSG CONSECUTIVE KINDNAPPING CASES
T.M. COMPANY PRESIDENT SHOT DEAD

1129
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:44,116
The third victim was shot dead
inside a station.

1130
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,179
So they're going to use a gun to kill
again at Shin-Nagoya Station this time?

1131
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,112
No, I'm sure they'll be using
the "Japanese Bullet"!

1132
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,063
In other words, the final showdown
will be on the Linear.

1133
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:58,994
Right. Akai-kun is headed to
Shin-Nagoya station as we speak.

1134
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:00,950
-We should hurry over as well.
-Got it!

1135
01:01:03,553 --> 01:01:06,026
Yumi-tan, you're drinking too much.

1136
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,701
You have to hold back a bit more,
or I can't introduce you to my family...

1137
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:12,462
What does your family have to do with it?

1138
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:15,496
We're gonna get married, anyway!

1139
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:19,394
So tasty!

1140
01:01:19,418 --> 01:01:22,252
You mean you're going to
accept my proposal?

1141
01:01:22,276 --> 01:01:24,792
Of course!

1142
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:26,136
Yumi-tan!

1143
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,647
I'll make you happy, I promise!

1144
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:34,846
Shall we return to Tokyo, too?

1145
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:36,610
Please follow me!

1146
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,836
I wanted to go on the Linear...

1147
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,019
What a shame.

1148
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:42,386
Is something the matter?

1149
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,588
I can't find a child that was with me...

1150
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:45,648
Ran!

1151
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:48,604
Have they found President Alan?

1152
01:01:48,628 --> 01:01:49,800
Probably not yet.

1153
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:52,275
But they're going to
run the Linear as planned,

1154
01:01:52,299 --> 01:01:53,762
and also go through
with the opening ceremonies.

1155
01:01:53,786 --> 01:01:54,723
SENDER: EDOGAWA
SUBJECT: SORRY, HAIBARA

1156
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:59,943
That's the WSG Association's decision.
I doubt it will be overturned.

1157
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,425
How was President John doing?

1158
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:04,106
It seems he's doing all right.

1159
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,714
Shouldn't you be there with him?

1160
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:08,906
I told you, President John has his SPs.

1161
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,737
My job is to investigate the case.

1162
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:12,509
Let's go!

1163
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:15,857
Hold on! Conan-kun hasn't come back yet!

1164
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:16,860
What about his phone?

1165
01:02:16,884 --> 01:02:19,809
I've been calling and calling,
but I can't seem to get through.

1166
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:22,408
If you're wondering about Edogawa-kun,

1167
01:02:22,432 --> 01:02:25,189
he said that he'd be heading home
with someone he knows.

1168
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,330
CONGRATULATIONS!

1169
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:35,936
There have been slight changes
to the original plan,

1170
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,231
and no passengers will board
the world's first Hyper Linear.

1171
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,276
Even so, look how many people

1172
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,970
have gathered to get
a look at the Hyper Linear!

1173
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,264
Now, it's finally time!

1174
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:03,709
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
-Now, it's not just train fans,

1175
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,626
-five, four, three, two...
-but all of Japan, no...

1176
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:10,386
People all over the world have been
eagerly awaiting this historic moment!

1177
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,580
One!

1178
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,202
The Hyper Linear has just been
set in motion, right on schedule!

1179
01:03:50,554 --> 01:03:51,810
What?

1180
01:03:51,834 --> 01:03:52,684
THE SPEEDS OF THE LINEAR ARE PRESENT IN THE COLORS

1181
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:56,026
Let's learn the mechanics
behind the Hyper Linear!

1182
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,889
THERE ARE 7 COLORS EVERYONE SHOULD REMEMBER WELL!

1183
01:03:57,193 --> 01:04:00,436
The linear starts out
by running on its wheels.

1184
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,486
Then, when the Linear accelerates over
150 km/h, the magnets and the suction

1185
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,736
from the coils will lift the train
above the tracks.

1186
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,366
After that, the Linear will enter
the "vacuum tunnel."

1187
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,286
Inside it, air resistance
has been reduced,

1188
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,060
so the train will
accelerate to 1,000 km/h.

1189
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:21,440
Speed can be controlled
from within the train,

1190
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:25,024
and when it emerges from the tunnel
and decelerates to 300 km/h,

1191
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:27,439
the "air brake" will take effect.

1192
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,717
Furthermore,
when it decelerates to 150 km/h,

1193
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:32,756
the wheels stored within
the chassis will emerge.

1194
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,450
If there's no driver on the Linear,
who's controlling it?

1195
01:04:36,474 --> 01:04:38,516
Well, that's—

1196
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,476
A very good question.

1197
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,511
Actually, within the Hyper Linear,

1198
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:47,099
there is a room designated as
the manual operation room.

1199
01:04:47,123 --> 01:04:50,366
However, this operation room is
only for test runs,

1200
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,986
so they are not normally used.

1201
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,104
Instead, the control room located

1202
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:58,076
between Shin-Nagoya and
Shibahama stations controls the Linear!

1203
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,496
Now, let's take a look inside the train
as it's racing along.

1204
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,128
-What?
-We can see inside the Linear?

1205
01:05:04,152 --> 01:05:05,600
Hurray!

1206
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:09,512
Unfortunately, there are no passengers
aboard today so there isn't anyone—

1207
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,355
Conan-kun?

1208
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:15,163
Sera-chan!?

1209
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,056
If President Alan isn't on board,

1210
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,812
being scolded won't be
the end of it for us.

1211
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,153
Hey, do you smell something?

1212
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:33,196
This is President Alan's!

1213
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,237
Huh? Is that so?

1214
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:37,616
Hey, that perp you saw at the airport...

1215
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,980
How many suitcases
did he have on the cart?

1216
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:42,337
Two.

1217
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,400
Both suitcases were identical.

1218
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,126
Two identical suitcases...

1219
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:50,118
If I remember correctly, the suitcase
John-san was placed in...

1220
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:52,170
was the type with a zipper!

1221
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,822
Conan-kun, what are you doing?

1222
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,848
This tangy scent... Can it be?

1223
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,490
Spotted them!

1224
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:09,654
The energy drink-smeared wheel prints
of a suitcase!

1225
01:06:11,452 --> 01:06:14,166
The vitamin B2 in energy drinks is
fluorescent.

1226
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:18,076
It lights up under black light.

1227
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,922
But anyway, that's
a really useful wristwatch

1228
01:06:20,946 --> 01:06:23,566
if it's got a black light on it as well...

1229
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,360
It's a detective tool from
a reliable professor, after all.

1230
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,876
Those kids must miss me so much,
they're spreading rumors about me!

1231
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,455
I got caught up in the repairs
so I'm running quite late now...

1232
01:06:37,479 --> 01:06:40,812
I hope they're enjoying
the Masked Yaiber show.

1233
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,924
Weak. You're too weak, Yaiber!

1234
01:06:46,948 --> 01:06:49,146
We will take the children now!

1235
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,106
S-Stop it, Jocker!

1236
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:54,406
-Hey, isn't Yaiber in trouble?
-There are way too many enemies!

1237
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,656
Okay, now!

1238
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,906
-Yaiber! Do your best!
-Yaiber! Do your best!

1239
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,416
Ugh, when is professor coming...

1240
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,534
That's enough, you phantoms!

1241
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:05,996
-Whose voice is that?
-Where are you?

1242
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,453
Hey, look at the sky!

1243
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:13,296
Then, the two that are
currently aboard the Linear...

1244
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,818
Sorry, he's with me.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1245
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:19,287
Well, um...

1246
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,596
Please stop the train at some station
along the way and drag him out!

1247
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,340
I'll go pick him up!

1248
01:07:24,364 --> 01:07:25,540
Well, um...

1249
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:27,964
We were supposed to
have a trial ride today,

1250
01:07:27,988 --> 01:07:31,416
so it's been programmed not to
stop at any stations along the route.

1251
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,669
But you can operate it
from the control room, right?

1252
01:07:35,558 --> 01:07:39,550
If we do that, it will also cancel
the flying of the national flags

1253
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:42,116
from the Linear
during the opening ceremonies.

1254
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,430
That was President Alan's idea, right?

1255
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:46,116
Right, it was.

1256
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,746
Would it be okay to cancel it because of
what's going on aboard the Linear?

1257
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:52,530
But we should contact
the control room regardless.

1258
01:07:52,554 --> 01:07:54,593
I'll go handle that.

1259
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,728
Conan-kun, Sera-chan...

1260
01:08:07,728 --> 01:08:10,768
Hello? Can you wait for just a bit longer?

1261
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:13,903
No...

1262
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,310
We've reached the time limit.

1263
01:08:21,257 --> 01:08:22,622
Got it.

1264
01:08:42,635 --> 01:08:43,667
Go!

1265
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,140
We have to hurry and find President Alan.

1266
01:08:49,164 --> 01:08:52,436
Conan-kun, that sound just now was
a gunshot, right?

1267
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,476
A bolt-action rifle, no less.

1268
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,960
Just what have you been up to
all this time, and with whom?

1269
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:03,853
It's fine.
The guy on the other end is on our side.

1270
01:09:08,599 --> 01:09:11,570
Do as you like from here, little boy.

1271
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:12,839
Hold on.

1272
01:09:12,863 --> 01:09:15,484
There's one more thing I need you to do.

1273
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:19,796
All right.

1274
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,796
Give me the numbers
of all the participants.

1275
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,110
What are you doing?! Jeez!

1276
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:36,640
Okay!

1277
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:39,899
What do you think you're doing?

1278
01:09:39,923 --> 01:09:41,369
I'm borrowing this.

1279
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:43,788
Hold on, Ai-chan! What's wrong?

1280
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,536
Jeez, you sure work people hard.

1281
01:09:54,829 --> 01:09:57,387
-The trail ends here.
-You're right.

1282
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:00,665
-I'm opening the door.
-Okay.

1283
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:07,419
Could he actually be inside!?

1284
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,905
Hold on a second!

1285
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:17,042
Are you all right?

1286
01:10:17,066 --> 01:10:19,439
So he's conscious, after all.

1287
01:10:19,463 --> 01:10:20,606
Where am I?

1288
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,396
Inside the Linear.

1289
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,232
How were you able to find me?

1290
01:10:25,256 --> 01:10:28,221
Thanks to the drink you dripped.

1291
01:10:28,997 --> 01:10:32,101
I'd expect nothing less
of a former FBI director.

1292
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:36,406
It's President Alan!

1293
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,834
-What the?
-Mori-san!

1294
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:40,342
What in the world is going on?

1295
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:41,910
Do you know something about this?

1296
01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:43,483
Everyone, listen up!

1297
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:49,096
President Alan was kidnapped along with
John-san during that quench!

1298
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:50,929
Say what?

1299
01:10:50,953 --> 01:10:54,572
And they were both
put inside the perp's car.

1300
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:57,271
Then did Alan-san see the face of the perp?

1301
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,896
Unfortunately not.

1302
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,861
But...

1303
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:04,082
We already know who the perpetrator is.

1304
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,353
By "we" you're talking about Conan-kun, too?

1305
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,223
Oh, no!

1306
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:13,206
The one who knows is Shinichi-niichan!

1307
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,100
So, who is the perp!?

1308
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:19,916
Before that, Conan-kun wants to
make one last confirmation.

1309
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:23,119
You mean Shinichi-niichan...

1310
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:33,719
Okay, please do it.

1311
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:35,330
Okay!

1312
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:41,050
INCOMING CALL
UNKNOWN CALLER

1313
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,716
Unknown caller?

1314
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,638
I got a call, too.

1315
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,356
Hello?

1316
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,116
Who is it?

1317
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,658
-Hello?
-From who?

1318
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:53,715
Could it be that...
everyone's cell phone is ringing?

1319
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:58,321
Mine and Conan-kun's are ringing, too.

1320
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:00,445
President Alan's, too.

1321
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:03,956
But there's one person
whose phone isn't ringing, right?

1322
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,110
Yup.

1323
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,736
Isn't that right?

1324
01:12:14,045 --> 01:12:15,441
Maiko Shirahato-san.

1325
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,319
-Shirahato-san?!
-Shirahato-san?!

1326
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:24,316
Looks like your phone isn't ringing.

1327
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,382
Oh, the battery's dead, see.

1328
01:12:26,406 --> 01:12:29,260
No, you haven't run out of juice,
have you?

1329
01:12:29,284 --> 01:12:34,835
I'm sure the electronics are acting weird
because you started up the MRI.

1330
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:36,649
In other words...

1331
01:12:36,673 --> 01:12:40,351
The person who triggered the quench
was you, Shirahato-san.

1332
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,146
My cellphone was broken...

1333
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,966
You're going to treat me as the
perpetrator because of a coincidence?

1334
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,184
Then, are you telling us that the fact
that you're on the Hyper Linear

1335
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,384
is also a coincidence?

1336
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:55,655
More than anything, Maiko Shirahato...

1337
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,365
It's not a coincidence that your name
is an anagram of "Makoto Ishihara,"

1338
01:12:59,389 --> 01:13:03,733
the perpetrator of the shooting incident
from 15 years ago?

1339
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:08,565
You couldn't give up
the name of your father,

1340
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:12,270
who died maintaining his innocence,
could you?

1341
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,157
Alan!

1342
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:19,036
That gun!

1343
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,511
Oh, what bliss! So you remember!

1344
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:23,797
That's right.

1345
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:27,462
It is the same model
as that case 15 years ago.

1346
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,466
That perpetrator,
by that I mean your father,

1347
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,796
insisted he was innocent 15 years ago.

1348
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:36,268
And yet, the FBI still arrested my father!

1349
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,521
Do you remember the first victim
of that case 15 years ago?

1350
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,881
The head of a Japanese
confectionery maker, was it?

1351
01:13:43,905 --> 01:13:49,316
When the head of that Japanese company
was abducted, my father was with me!

1352
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,169
So you're saying he had an alibi...

1353
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,994
Back then, that's exactly
what I testified to the FBI!

1354
01:13:55,277 --> 01:13:57,255
And yet, my father was arrested...

1355
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:59,826
And all the while proclaiming
his innocence, while incarcerated...

1356
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,935
And my mother, right after
moving back to Japan...

1357
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:05,940
All that anxiety must have gotten to her.
Her death was all too quick.

1358
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,506
So that's why you've been harboring
a grudge against the FBI all this time.

1359
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:13,476
That's why I changed my name
as I was told to by the USMS.

1360
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,168
You mean that witness protection program
that comes with a plea bargain.

1361
01:14:20,192 --> 01:14:23,226
You're pretty well-versed for a child.

1362
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,120
Right.

1363
01:14:24,144 --> 01:14:27,776
The USMS had no clue
about Japanese kana letters.

1364
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,486
That's why they didn't notice that

1365
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,617
I used the same letters
as my father's name.

1366
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:35,736
And then, 7 years ago, I found
the gods of fortune on my side!

1367
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,180
Seven years ago...

1368
01:14:37,204 --> 01:14:40,720
That was the year that Tokyo was
named WSG host city.

1369
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:43,194
Right. And...

1370
01:14:43,218 --> 01:14:46,795
it was the year this man
became the president of WSG!

1371
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:48,668
It felt like destiny to me!

1372
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:54,886
And that's why you decided to
infiltrate WSG Association Japan.

1373
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,418
Right.

1374
01:14:56,442 --> 01:15:00,020
That's how I found out that this man
would be aboard the Linear...

1375
01:15:00,044 --> 01:15:03,838
Aboard the "Nippon-no-Dangan"...
the Japanese Bullet!

1376
01:15:04,415 --> 01:15:07,763
And that's why you recreated the case
from 15 years ago?

1377
01:15:08,057 --> 01:15:12,026
Just so I could remind this man
of his own crimes.

1378
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,196
But you didn't kill any other people.

1379
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,217
That's right.

1380
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:20,188
The only man I need to kill is this one.
You two get out of the way.

1381
01:15:23,747 --> 01:15:27,876
Right when this "Japanese Bullet" arrives
at the terminal station...

1382
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:32,986
That's what I'd planned at first... But
thanks to you two, I'm changing my plan.

1383
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,723
I'm going to have him die right now!

1384
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:57,850
So the gods really are on my side.

1385
01:15:57,874 --> 01:15:59,179
Stop it!

1386
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,785
You told me that only I need to die?

1387
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,261
Yes, I only need to kill you!

1388
01:16:06,285 --> 01:16:08,625
Okay, then shoot here!

1389
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:09,916
Mr. MacKenzie!

1390
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,918
Here!

1391
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,522
Shoot here from a higher position!

1392
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:17,860
Then, even if the bullet goes through me,
it will only hit the floor.

1393
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:20,856
"Shoot here from a higher position,
aiming for my chest."

1394
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,000
"Then, even if the bullet goes through me,
it will only hit the floor."

1395
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,740
The Linear uses
super-lightweight materials

1396
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:30,401
in order to attain higher speeds, right?

1397
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:37,276
Oh, that's right.

1398
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,236
If the bullet goes through
the wall or the ceiling,

1399
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,220
it will affect the Linear's course.

1400
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:44,616
And that would endanger everyone here.

1401
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,754
Same with the floor, sturdy as it may be.

1402
01:16:46,778 --> 01:16:49,157
If you shoot from point-blank range,
you can still pierce it.

1403
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:53,385
That's why Alan-san is telling you to
move away enough

1404
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:56,966
to barely hit his left chest, and to aim
from as high a position as possible.

1405
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:58,736
You need to shut up!

1406
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,006
Shirahato-san...

1407
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:03,256
I'm sure you know, but
Alan-san is a professional shooter,

1408
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,950
who once competed in the WSG
as a shooting athlete.

1409
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:08,681
Conan-kun! Dad!

1410
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,310
Here! Aim here!

1411
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,236
Higher!

1412
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,715
Go back!

1413
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,004
More!

1414
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:23,647
Lift your arms!

1415
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,986
One more step!

1416
01:17:28,037 --> 01:17:29,167
Now!

1417
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:49,448
Conan-kun!

1418
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:51,990
What? What just happened?

1419
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,375
Who was it? Who shot her!?

1420
01:18:00,104 --> 01:18:03,185
I'm sure the shooter was... Akai-san.

1421
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:06,395
But Shu is still in Nagoya, isn't he?

1422
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:09,733
The Linear is approaching Yamanashi now.

1423
01:18:09,757 --> 01:18:11,904
It's impossible to snipe her
from that distance.

1424
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:12,815
NAGOYA/YAMANASHI/TOKYO

1425
01:18:12,839 --> 01:18:16,873
That's why Akai-san had
a special bullet made.

1426
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,975
A bullet not made of steel, but of silver!

1427
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,630
A silver bullet that won't stick to

1428
01:18:34,654 --> 01:18:37,646
the electromagnets embedded
in the walls of the Linear's tracks.

1429
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,454
If the Linear's lift magnets generate
electromagnetic induction voltage,

1430
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:44,236
when the silver bullet, traveling
at 1,000 km/h, enters the tunnel,

1431
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,430
the bullet would remain unaffected
by gravity or air resistance,

1432
01:18:48,454 --> 01:18:53,175
and thus able to pursue
the Linear at the same speed.

1433
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,089
And then,
if the Linear were to decelerate,

1434
01:18:56,113 --> 01:18:58,840
and that deceleration time
lasted long enough...

1435
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,780
the silver bullet could use that time

1436
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:04,109
to pierce through the Linear's
super-lightweight material.

1437
01:19:08,505 --> 01:19:11,054
And in that instant,
if the perp's vital spot is

1438
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,391
at a pre-calculated location
within the cabin,

1439
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,435
that would make sniping possible.

1440
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:19,040
And to do that, he would need
an accomplice within the cabin.

1441
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:23,702
-You're not saying that's—
-Yes, that boy, Conan Edogawa-kun.

1442
01:19:23,977 --> 01:19:25,430
Shirahato-san!

1443
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,656
Conan-kun, Sera-chan, are you all right?

1444
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,632
Everyone is fine.

1445
01:19:30,656 --> 01:19:33,406
-Why was the perp shot?
-Was it accidental fire?

1446
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:34,672
That doesn't matter.

1447
01:19:34,696 --> 01:19:38,226
Stop this Linear at the nearest station
and call an ambulance!

1448
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,912
Considering the Linear's current location,

1449
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:43,498
the closest station would be
the terminal station.

1450
01:19:43,522 --> 01:19:45,620
In other words, Shibahama Station...

1451
01:19:45,644 --> 01:19:49,016
We'll have the police and an ambulance
standing by at Shibahama Station.

1452
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,060
Whew, and that's another case closed.

1453
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,226
Nope, not yet.

1454
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,142
That's right.
Her accomplice is still on the loose.

1455
01:19:56,728 --> 01:19:59,016
What? An accomplice?

1456
01:20:06,504 --> 01:20:08,840
Yumi, are you okay?

1457
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:11,050
Ima'okeeey...

1458
01:20:11,074 --> 01:20:13,232
I won't puke...

1459
01:20:13,744 --> 01:20:15,683
Until I see your family.

1460
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:19,626
Let's go back to Tokyo for today.
Let's just take a taxi to the station...

1461
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:22,679
That car is definitely
breaking the speed limit!

1462
01:20:22,703 --> 01:20:25,206
Hey, you! Stop!

1463
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,721
Y-Yumi-tan!

1464
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:35,221
Yumi-tan! Are you okay?

1465
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:39,008
Hey, Yumi-tan! Yumi-tan! Yumi-tan!

1466
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,839
There's an accomplice? What do you mean?

1467
01:20:42,863 --> 01:20:45,010
Isn't that right, Conan-kun?

1468
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:49,656
Looks like Sera-no-neechan noticed too,
Shinichi-niichan.

1469
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,895
Of course I would notice,
after seeing something like that.

1470
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:58,117
Clearly, someone was
operating it remotely.

1471
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:02,538
Right when the perp had
her back to the wall, too.

1472
01:21:02,562 --> 01:21:05,013
In other words,
the accomplice helped her out.

1473
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:07,984
The perp had a huge suitcase
with President Alan in it,

1474
01:21:08,008 --> 01:21:10,797
and came on board.

1475
01:21:10,821 --> 01:21:12,715
Even with fewer cops
around Shin-Nagoya Station

1476
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:14,306
thanks to the quench incident
at the airport,

1477
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:18,202
normally, it would still be a tough task.

1478
01:21:18,226 --> 01:21:22,629
In other words, the accomplice is
involved with the Linear, and is male.

1479
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,968
Isn't that right, Inoue-san?

1480
01:21:27,738 --> 01:21:31,265
Coming up with a method
like the quench and pulling it off...

1481
01:21:31,289 --> 01:21:33,710
Who but the engineer of the Linear?

1482
01:21:34,426 --> 01:21:36,786
Come to think of it,
both the Linear and MRIs

1483
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,349
use superconductive magnets.

1484
01:21:39,373 --> 01:21:43,956
Were you able to make a device like that
because you were in charge of programming?

1485
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,927
The only one who can remotely
achieve sudden deceleration like that,

1486
01:21:47,951 --> 01:21:52,442
is the engineer who can see inside
the Hyper Linear Liner in real-time!

1487
01:21:56,994 --> 01:21:58,055
Darn it!

1488
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,239
-You're not getting away!
-Found it.

1489
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,980
The software linked to the system
for the Hyper Linear's control room!

1490
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:05,723
G-Give that back!

1491
01:22:05,747 --> 01:22:07,745
Why did you do such a thing?

1492
01:22:07,769 --> 01:22:12,383
There were only two Japanese people
involved in the case from 15 years ago.

1493
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,270
The culprit, Makoto Ishihara,

1494
01:22:14,294 --> 01:22:17,310
and the first target,
the confectionery maker head.

1495
01:22:17,735 --> 01:22:20,417
That was my dad.

1496
01:22:20,441 --> 01:22:21,746
What!?

1497
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,456
After pulling out of the WSG sponsorship,

1498
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,520
my father got blasted by
everyone in America.

1499
01:22:26,544 --> 01:22:29,433
Ultimately, he was fired from his position
as head of the company!

1500
01:22:29,799 --> 01:22:34,676
My family lost everything thanks to
that incident 15 years ago!

1501
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:40,068
But the FBI pinned it all on the wrong
perpetrator and closed the case.

1502
01:22:40,092 --> 01:22:41,942
The wrong perpetrator?

1503
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:43,396
Four years later...

1504
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:46,017
That copycat was captured.

1505
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,314
I knew that guy's face!

1506
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:54,630
One of the perps that abducted my father
15 years ago, that face!

1507
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:56,483
The FBI buried my testimony!

1508
01:22:56,507 --> 01:23:01,596
Just so they could cover up the fact
that they locked up an innocent man!

1509
01:23:04,457 --> 01:23:06,778
Is that your grudge against the FBI?

1510
01:23:06,802 --> 01:23:10,430
The censure my father was getting
from everyone in America was intense.

1511
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:12,796
We couldn't possibly stay in
the United States because of it.

1512
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,413
So that's why you came to Japan?

1513
01:23:14,437 --> 01:23:17,340
And then, back here in Japan...

1514
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:21,000
As I did research on the case
from 15 years ago on the net,

1515
01:23:21,024 --> 01:23:23,667
I found a woman
who harbored the same grudge.

1516
01:23:23,691 --> 01:23:27,032
Maiko Shirahato, your accomplice?

1517
01:23:27,056 --> 01:23:28,999
Yeah, that's right!

1518
01:23:32,868 --> 01:23:34,469
Outta the way!

1519
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:36,534
Hold up, darn you!

1520
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:39,827
Dad!

1521
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:43,466
Haibara, what's going on? What's wrong?

1522
01:23:43,903 --> 01:23:46,626
Are you all right? Answer me! Haibara?

1523
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:47,866
Haibara?

1524
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,374
Haibara?!

1525
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,522
The perp escaped. Shin-Minatohama Station.

1526
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:53,780
Darn it!

1527
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:57,740
Hello, Sensei? Where are you?

1528
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,129
Yes, I get it. I need to head over to
Shin-Minatohama station, then.

1529
01:24:02,153 --> 01:24:03,041
Camel!

1530
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:04,147
On it!

1531
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,991
Since I last saw her,

1532
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:17,300
it's like she's become
a completely different person.

1533
01:24:17,324 --> 01:24:21,236
Come to think of it, I once asked you
to be her bodyguard, didn't I?

1534
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,406
There was.

1535
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,180
CONAN EDOGAWA

1536
01:24:25,386 --> 01:24:27,172
What's up, little boy?

1537
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,373
He's huge, but he runs fast!

1538
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:35,457
He even had a getaway car ready, too!

1539
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:39,176
Soon, the world's first Hyper Linear
will arrive at Shibahama Station.

1540
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,105
MASKED YAIBER

1541
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:41,256
Come on, let's go home.

1542
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,139
Huh? No way!

1543
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:47,367
The Linear is finally going to come by.
Let's head over to the platform to see it.

1544
01:24:47,391 --> 01:24:49,126
What should we do, Professor?

1545
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,102
We have no choice...

1546
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,952
I think it's impossible
to chase after them now.

1547
01:24:55,976 --> 01:24:57,656
Darn it...

1548
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,514
Ran! Contact Inspector Megure!

1549
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:06,294
Yup. After this,
can you go help Sensei out?

1550
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,613
On the other end of that call,

1551
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:12,554
there are two people
that you call "our allies."

1552
01:25:12,578 --> 01:25:14,702
Huh? What are you talking about?

1553
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:17,542
One is the person you call "Sensei."

1554
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:21,883
The other uses a rifle
and is most likely FBI.

1555
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:26,766
It is now 10 minutes before arrival in
Shibahama Station.

1556
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,705
We will now begin deceleration.

1557
01:25:29,547 --> 01:25:31,323
It's ringing.

1558
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,986
Shinichi! Where are you right now?

1559
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:43,446
Dad contacted me and said
he lost sight of the perpetrator

1560
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:45,524
at the Kouhoku Interchange
in Shin-Minatohama...

1561
01:25:45,548 --> 01:25:47,060
Shinichi?

1562
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,943
You had... two smartphones.

1563
01:25:51,967 --> 01:25:54,144
Yup, that's right.

1564
01:25:54,168 --> 01:25:57,714
Hello, Sensei?
The current location of the perp is...

1565
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,415
Near the Kouhoku Interchange?

1566
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:03,886
If they headed to the Kouhoku
Interchange from Shin-Minatohama,

1567
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,281
perhaps they are
heading to Tokyo via Daisan Keihin?

1568
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,502
Or, they're making it look that way,

1569
01:26:10,526 --> 01:26:12,976
and are headed to the coast
on the southbound lanes.

1570
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,381
For what purpose?

1571
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:18,946
I think it's better not to overly
complicate your thoughts.

1572
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:23,066
For instance, beyond Kouhoku Interchange,

1573
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,446
an industrial
road stretches east and west.

1574
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:30,244
If you head west on that, you arrive at
Kamoike Bridge over the Tsurumi River.

1575
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:34,374
And right around now, you should be
able to see the Linear from the bridge.

1576
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,729
Don't tell me—

1577
01:26:35,753 --> 01:26:38,376
You mean the perp is
going after the Linear!?

1578
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,756
Most likely.

1579
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,264
-Jodie!
-Got it, Shu!

1580
01:26:42,288 --> 01:26:43,781
-Camel!
-On it!

1581
01:26:43,805 --> 01:26:46,443
-Hurry to the Kamoike Bridge!
-Roger that!

1582
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:52,975
Conan-kun, can you show me
both of your smartphones?

1583
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,886
I want to know who my allies are.

1584
01:26:58,075 --> 01:27:02,445
Or is there a reason why
you can't show them to me, maybe?

1585
01:27:14,428 --> 01:27:16,476
This will end it all.

1586
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:22,433
What was that sound?

1587
01:27:22,457 --> 01:27:25,360
It can't be... We're accelerating?

1588
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,589
I thought they decelerated because
we're almost at Shibahama station.

1589
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:30,466
No way...

1590
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,752
Are they still trying to kill Alan-san?

1591
01:27:33,814 --> 01:27:36,684
By using this "Japanese Bullet"!

1592
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,226
Found it.

1593
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,986
That black German car.
Looks like that's the one.

1594
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,806
-Be careful.
-Okay!

1595
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:50,007
What is that car, an unmarked cop?

1596
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:52,832
Following it!

1597
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:59,110
At this speed, the wheels won't
extend from the Linear!

1598
01:27:59,134 --> 01:28:01,550
It's going to collide into the station!

1599
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:03,890
Can't you do anything about this?

1600
01:28:03,914 --> 01:28:05,626
You're asking me?

1601
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:08,466
The Hyper Linear has a manual
operation room, doesn't it?

1602
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:11,033
Contact the control room and
get some instructions from them!

1603
01:28:11,777 --> 01:28:14,087
Those two might be able to do something.

1604
01:28:14,111 --> 01:28:16,936
Oh no, amateur children
wouldn't be able to operate—

1605
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,574
Hurry up and just do it!

1606
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,283
No good. The brakes aren't working!

1607
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:28,486
Darn it!

1608
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:32,286
Haibara, we can't decelerate even if
we follow the control room's directions!

1609
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,774
-Why no speed change?
-The cause is unknown!

1610
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,246
The control room is saying
they can't operate it either!

1611
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,461
Why not?

1612
01:28:39,485 --> 01:28:42,124
Some unknown program is
running on its own,

1613
01:28:42,148 --> 01:28:43,956
and they can't seem to stop it!

1614
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:48,386
Meaning another system that the perp
programmed beforehand?

1615
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,542
If it keeps going like this,
what will happen?

1616
01:28:50,953 --> 01:28:53,598
We stopped all electrical currents
on the tracks,

1617
01:28:53,622 --> 01:28:55,780
so there will be no force
to keep the Hyper Linear afloat.

1618
01:28:55,804 --> 01:28:59,036
It will gradually slow down,
and in the end...

1619
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,623
make a belly landing.

1620
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,388
A belly landing!

1621
01:29:03,412 --> 01:29:04,752
It'll be all right.

1622
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:09,156
As long as the train's superconductive
magnets are working, they won't derail.

1623
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:13,640
Even if it slows down, it will make the
belly landing while maintaining balance.

1624
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:16,216
Who in the world are you?

1625
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:19,607
Just a grade school student
who's crazy about science.

1626
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:23,723
What's that!?

1627
01:29:33,872 --> 01:29:36,476
Camel, you have the skills
to pull this off, right?

1628
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,161
Yes. It's just that
I'm not familiar with this area.

1629
01:29:39,185 --> 01:29:41,185
Don't worry, I'll do the navi—

1630
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,508
No, we'll take care of that.

1631
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:47,777
You've memorized all the maps
of that area. Right?

1632
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:52,947
Yeah. I see a path to victory.

1633
01:29:54,914 --> 01:29:57,435
First, divide the offensive
into two fronts.

1634
01:29:57,459 --> 01:30:00,241
Jodie, Camel, you two need to split up.

1635
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:08,666
Akai-kun... We've split up.

1636
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:10,591
What do we do next, Shu?

1637
01:30:11,094 --> 01:30:14,422
-One will maintain the status quo.
-Camel, keep on its tail.

1638
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,706
The other will standby in the location
I'm about to name.

1639
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,427
What? Standby?

1640
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:22,008
An unorthodox form of a shogi puzzle.

1641
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,113
With this tactic,
it's five moves to checkmate.

1642
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,533
You're late! Let's go after the perp!

1643
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:32,656
Actually, we have intel that the Hyper
Linear is running out of control.

1644
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,054
In five minutes, it will crash into
Shibahama Station!

1645
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:38,690
What did you say!?

1646
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:41,925
Everyone, please stay calm as you proceed!

1647
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:44,448
Everyone, are you with me?

1648
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:47,416
-We're fine, Professor!
-We can't get a look at the Hyper Linear?

1649
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,959
What in the world has happened?

1650
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,532
-What?
-An earthquake?

1651
01:30:54,556 --> 01:30:57,021
The tremors are so violent,
I can't stay on my feet!

1652
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:58,731
The door...

1653
01:31:04,571 --> 01:31:07,634
-Why are they losing balance like that?
-Yes, I understand.

1654
01:31:07,658 --> 01:31:10,486
When I asked the control room,
they said that there's liquid helium

1655
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:11,816
leaking from the Hyper Linear!

1656
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,508
No way! A quench?

1657
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,096
I'm not getting any response anymore!

1658
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,766
Edogawa-kun! The superconductive magnet on
the Hyper Linear has quenched!

1659
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,558
I see, so that explosive sound earlier...

1660
01:31:25,303 --> 01:31:27,862
At this rate, they're going to derail...
What can we do?

1661
01:31:27,886 --> 01:31:29,086
Oh, look there!

1662
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,735
That looks dangerous!

1663
01:31:33,033 --> 01:31:34,694
Conan-kun...

1664
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,240
Ran!

1665
01:31:40,641 --> 01:31:41,953
Ran?

1666
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:47,627
Edogawa-kun, that room you were just in,
that was the sub-control room.

1667
01:31:47,651 --> 01:31:50,396
You might be able to
get the brakes to work

1668
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,906
from the main operation room
in the front car!

1669
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:55,330
-Got it. Thank you!
-Hurry!

1670
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:02,013
First move. The offensive heads to
Yanishi Station near Hachiouji Highway.

1671
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:03,826
Camel, head to Yanishi station.

1672
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:07,502
What? If I do that, I'll distance myself
from the perp's car!

1673
01:32:07,526 --> 01:32:09,770
-Just do it. Yanishi Station.
-Okay!

1674
01:32:12,563 --> 01:32:14,996
So that guy wasn't
chasing after me or anything?

1675
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:16,060
Second move.

1676
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:19,689
The defensive continues down
Highway 109 towards Umenoki.

1677
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:27,000
It's up ahead!

1678
01:32:28,748 --> 01:32:29,977
That's it, huh?

1679
01:32:31,972 --> 01:32:34,525
What should I do? At this rate...

1680
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,329
INCOMING CALL
SONOKO

1681
01:32:37,353 --> 01:32:38,261
Sonoko?

1682
01:32:38,285 --> 01:32:42,218
Ran!? Shibahama Station is in an uproar
over the runaway Hyper Linear!

1683
01:32:42,242 --> 01:32:44,826
They've canceled
the WSG Opening Ceremony, too,

1684
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,616
and there's an evacuation advisory
in effect!

1685
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,449
No way...

1686
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:50,523
You're on the Shinkansen now,
so you're okay, right?

1687
01:32:50,547 --> 01:32:53,280
I'm okay, but there's something else—

1688
01:32:53,304 --> 01:32:58,405
I called Ai-chan but couldn't get through,
so we've been worried!

1689
01:32:58,429 --> 01:33:00,437
Ai-chan is with me, but Con—

1690
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:02,506
Oh! Haibara's right there?

1691
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:03,587
Then tell her, please tell her!

1692
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,530
It was unbelievable! A new Yaiber...

1693
01:33:06,554 --> 01:33:10,229
...came down from the sky in a parachute!
It was awesome!

1694
01:33:10,253 --> 01:33:12,566
P-Parachute...

1695
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,639
-A parachute!
-A parachute!

1696
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:23,121
No good. The brakes over here
seem to be broken as well.

1697
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:24,786
Looks like we're done for.

1698
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:26,970
Wait, Conan-kun, what are you doing?

1699
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:29,626
I was just wondering what this was.

1700
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:31,446
Edogawa-kun, can you hear me?

1701
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,788
He's here!

1702
01:33:42,595 --> 01:33:43,866
Darn it!

1703
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:50,885
What is that car?

1704
01:34:08,356 --> 01:34:10,222
I'll pursue him right away!

1705
01:34:10,246 --> 01:34:11,447
Third move.

1706
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:13,711
The offensive will head to Loop Highway 2.

1707
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:17,187
Loop Highway 2, Camel.

1708
01:34:17,211 --> 01:34:20,400
B-But I finally caught up to
the perp again!

1709
01:34:20,424 --> 01:34:23,748
-Camel!
-H-Heading over.

1710
01:34:34,596 --> 01:34:38,015
I've completely lost sight
of the perp's car.

1711
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,760
No, he's right here.

1712
01:34:40,784 --> 01:34:42,465
Got that, Conan-kun!?

1713
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:44,246
Even if you can't operate the brakes,

1714
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:46,647
there's a better chance
that everything else will work!

1715
01:34:46,671 --> 01:34:47,996
Yeah, got it.

1716
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,454
When you're done setting up,
hit the blue button!

1717
01:34:50,478 --> 01:34:52,105
Yeah, thank you!

1718
01:34:52,129 --> 01:34:54,791
Well now, I guess we'll head to

1719
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,939
the rear operation seat just like Ran-kun
and company have suggested.

1720
01:34:56,963 --> 01:34:59,166
-I'll stay here.
-What?

1721
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:01,652
It's better to split up, just in case.

1722
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:05,143
If you hear my voice from there,
think of it as the sign to go ahead!

1723
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:08,131
Roger that!

1724
01:35:12,626 --> 01:35:14,846
Huh!? How!?

1725
01:35:17,464 --> 01:35:19,227
How is this happening!?

1726
01:35:42,516 --> 01:35:46,580
Fourth move. The defensive will
change lanes and head to a side street.

1727
01:35:46,604 --> 01:35:48,387
You bastard!

1728
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:00,396
No good! I can't follow him. I've failed!

1729
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,815
You haven't. Fifth move.

1730
01:36:02,839 --> 01:36:05,956
The offensive at Shin-Minatohama Bridge...
Checkmate!

1731
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,180
Jodie!

1732
01:36:10,242 --> 01:36:11,729
He really showed up...

1733
01:36:13,677 --> 01:36:14,576
Freeze!

1734
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,486
Who the hell is that!?

1735
01:36:26,678 --> 01:36:29,348
It should only be a little further
to the very front...

1736
01:36:31,003 --> 01:36:36,421
All right, once I've tied this end,
my work here will be done!

1737
01:36:37,398 --> 01:36:40,442
Now, all I have to do is to wait for
Conan-kun's signal.

1738
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:53,682
I'm here...

1739
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:57,337
Now, Sera!

1740
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,307
That's a huge parachute!

1741
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:26,922
Go!

1742
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:40,553
Conan-kun!

1743
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:54,334
Darn it! No way am I gonna die here!

1744
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,165
Conan-kun!

1745
01:38:30,884 --> 01:38:32,514
No way...

1746
01:38:34,189 --> 01:38:36,132
The monitor is back online!

1747
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,162
Out of my way!

1748
01:38:40,775 --> 01:38:42,153
Not there...

1749
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:45,455
Sorry, do you mind?

1750
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:05,335
Conan-kun!

1751
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,885
Sera-chan!

1752
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:09,926
Both of you, please answer me!

1753
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,376
Edogawa-kun!

1754
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:16,444
H-Haibara...

1755
01:39:16,799 --> 01:39:18,253
Ran-neechan...

1756
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,669
Don't worry... We're all okay!

1757
01:39:38,866 --> 01:39:41,061
For the perpetrator to come right to us...

1758
01:39:41,361 --> 01:39:44,182
What kind of magic did you use, Shu?

1759
01:39:44,474 --> 01:39:46,980
It wasn't magic. It was shogi.

1760
01:39:47,409 --> 01:39:48,425
Shogi?

1761
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:49,530
Yeah.

1762
01:39:49,554 --> 01:39:51,435
On my side is the best brain in Japan...

1763
01:39:51,838 --> 01:39:55,872
No, in the whole world.

1764
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,564
FBI!

1765
01:40:01,588 --> 01:40:04,366
I want to see both hands behind your head!
On the ground, face down!

1766
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:06,829
FBI, you say?

1767
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,536
FBI...

1768
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:25,743
The same FBI that buried my testimony!?

1769
01:40:25,767 --> 01:40:29,860
Fifteen years ago,
I'm positive that I witnessed it.

1770
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:32,740
But you guys took Ishihara...

1771
01:40:32,764 --> 01:40:36,747
Makoto Ishihara was a mistaken
perpetrator that you guys cooked up!

1772
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:39,236
The perp from 15 years ago was
Makoto Ishihara.

1773
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,990
-Don't lie to me!
-It's not a lie!

1774
01:40:42,438 --> 01:40:46,500
The copycat perp we arrested four years
later admitted as much!

1775
01:40:46,863 --> 01:40:50,287
That copycat was the man you witnessed.

1776
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:55,465
And that man was Makoto Ishihara's
accomplice in the case 15 years ago.

1777
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:56,832
Lies!

1778
01:40:56,856 --> 01:41:01,390
Then when you arrested him 11 years ago,
why didn't you ever name him

1779
01:41:01,414 --> 01:41:04,513
as one of the perps
from the case 15 years ago?

1780
01:41:04,537 --> 01:41:06,471
Because of the plea bargain.

1781
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,174
He gave up the name of his accomplice

1782
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:12,380
for his past crimes
in exchange for immunity.

1783
01:41:12,404 --> 01:41:16,856
That man was granted immunity from
prosecution in the case 15 years ago.

1784
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,310
That's why we never named him.

1785
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,577
Maiko Shirahato's father, Makoto Ishihara,

1786
01:41:23,601 --> 01:41:27,410
was an accomplice of the perp
who kidnapped your father.

1787
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,630
So you aligned yourself
with such a person,

1788
01:41:30,654 --> 01:41:34,106
and became a criminal
seeking needless revenge.

1789
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:38,196
That's not true! It's all because of
your selfish plea bargains!

1790
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:40,084
Selfish plea bargains?

1791
01:41:40,108 --> 01:41:41,366
That's right!

1792
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:44,430
The filthy tactics
you guys are so good at!

1793
01:41:44,454 --> 01:41:46,436
Because of that, I—

1794
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:47,766
How do you think you and your family

1795
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:51,036
were able to escape
the censure of the entire United States?

1796
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:56,481
How do you think you were able to pull off
this foolish charade of a revenge tragedy?

1797
01:41:56,505 --> 01:41:58,046
What are you saying?

1798
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,507
It was all because you changed your name
under the witness protection program.

1799
01:42:01,531 --> 01:42:02,736
Am I right?

1800
01:42:05,233 --> 01:42:10,645
That's also one of
the "filthy plea bargains" you speak of.

1801
01:42:23,944 --> 01:42:26,325
-And the perp?
-Over here.

1802
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:33,658
Let's leave the rest
to the Japanese police.

1803
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:40,770
Conan-kun! Sera-kun!

1804
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:43,506
Both of you! How badly are you injured?

1805
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:45,506
I only have minor scratches!

1806
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,720
Same here!

1807
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,840
I'm glad you're safe and sound.

1808
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:50,716
Who is that?

1809
01:42:52,649 --> 01:42:56,376
That's the perp, Maiko Shirahato.
I'll hand her off to you.

1810
01:42:58,928 --> 01:43:01,569
I see, so she survived.

1811
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,078
I have to hand it to you, Shu.

1812
01:43:03,102 --> 01:43:06,236
That was a difficult snipe
using the Linear's tracks...

1813
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:08,979
And you avoided her vital organs
so precisely.

1814
01:43:09,003 --> 01:43:10,993
No one but you could have—

1815
01:43:11,017 --> 01:43:12,713
No, it wasn't me...

1816
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:15,538
It was all thanks to that little boy.

1817
01:43:17,478 --> 01:43:19,756
Right when everyone's cellphones rang?

1818
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:23,520
Yeah. That was when
I sent a text to Alan-san.

1819
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:26,846
"If worse comes to worst, I want to
position the perp's shoulder

1820
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:28,660
at that spot, so please help me out."

1821
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:33,294
Higher! Go back! More!

1822
01:43:33,318 --> 01:43:35,104
So that's why...

1823
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,615
Not killing even the most
dangerous of criminals.

1824
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,790
That seems to be that little boy's policy.

1825
01:43:48,336 --> 01:43:51,256
Not how we at the FBI operate.

1826
01:43:56,049 --> 01:44:00,339
Man, that was my favorite jacket, too.

1827
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:02,167
Oh, well.

1828
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:07,844
Let's go back.

1829
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:11,116
Sure!

1830
01:48:32,685 --> 01:48:33,605
Yeah.

1831
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:36,156
I'll leave it parked there,
so come and get it.

1832
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,196
Roger that.

1833
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,738
And...

1834
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,715
There are two passengers aboard.

1835
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:43,068
So please get them home
as courteously as you can.

1836
01:48:43,349 --> 01:48:44,911
My bad, Camel.

1837
01:48:55,172 --> 01:48:57,873
Hey, FBI kid.

1838
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:00,596
I don't know who the hell you are,
but because of you,

1839
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:04,645
a VIP of my country nearly came to harm.

1840
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:08,605
Luckily, this time around
nothing serious happened,

1841
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:10,750
so I'll let you off the hook.

1842
01:49:11,563 --> 01:49:13,670
But know that there will be no next time.

1843
01:49:26,549 --> 01:49:28,290
"Kid," huh?

1844
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,757
What?!

1845
01:49:31,225 --> 01:49:34,842
You don't remember?
Even after that promise we made?

1846
01:49:34,866 --> 01:49:37,756
Well... I was drunk, so I remember nothing...

1847
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,189
I-Impossible...

1848
01:49:40,496 --> 01:49:44,208
I do remember that I puked inside
someone's car, though...

1849
01:49:51,196 --> 01:49:53,169
What is this smell?

1850
01:50:04,813 --> 01:50:06,273
Hey, you guys!

1851
01:50:07,062 --> 01:50:08,661
I hear you're up next!

1852
01:50:11,693 --> 01:50:12,802
-Right!
-Right!

1853
01:50:12,826 --> 01:50:13,456
DETECTIVE CONAN

1854
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,690
COMING GW 2022
