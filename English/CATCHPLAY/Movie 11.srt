1
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,583
Emergency, emergency,

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,000
Superintendent 503 to MPD

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,917
Emergency, emergency,

4
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,792
Superintendent 503, over.

5
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,000
Have currently located a suspicious car

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,208
that looks to be that of
the armed robber on the run,

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,875
going from Sotobori Avenue to Miyuki Avenue!

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,167
MPD, roger!

9
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,167
Would like report on
license plate number of suspicious car

10
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,542
as well as description of suspects
and clothing, over.

11
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,125
Superintendent 503, roger.

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,708
The car is a black van,

13
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,083
Shinjuku 500

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,958
Sa-3255.

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,542
The description of the suspects are...

16
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,000
Lupin and Fujiko.

17
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,083
Please do not joke around,
Superintendent 503, over.

18
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,792
I'm not joking...

19
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,708
Superintendent 503 to MPD.

20
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,792
Lupin has taken a left
on Chuo Ave. from Miyuki Ave.

21
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:04,542
Superintendent 503, please cut it out, over.

22
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:07,208
I'm telling you, I'm not joking!

23
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,042
H, Hey, Officer Sato,

24
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:12,958
drive more carefully, will you...

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,542
Don't you have to contact headquarters?

26
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,792
Oh, yes ma'am!

27
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,208
503 to MPD.

28
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,583
The suspect has made a right turn
on Harumi Ave...

29
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,167
I can't forgive them for using Lupin's mask

30
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,292
to carry out a robbery!!

31
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,625
Welcome, good evening...

32
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,958
It'll be 1,237 yen.

33
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,458
Car up ahead! Pull over!!

34
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,417
I wonder if it's a crime...

35
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,542
Awesome...

36
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,167
Car up ahead, pull over!!

37
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,000
I repeat!

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,625
You can't get away!

39
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,083
Pull over to the shoulder of the road!!

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,542
How dare they!

41
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,792
An eye for an eye... A tooth for a tooth!

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,375
O, Officer Sato?!
They're going to get away...

43
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,083
Hang on tight!

44
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,250
Huh?

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,458
Officer Sato, w, what do you plan to...

46
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,083
You'll bite your tongue if you keep talking!

47
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,042
O, Officer Sato?

48
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,833
Quiet!!

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,375
H, Hey, Officer Sato?

50
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,583
Officer Takagi! Contact headquarters.

51
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,292
Yes, ma'am!

52
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,208
I tell you, really...

53
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,708
Officer Sato!

54
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,333
Back-up squads and the ambulance
will be here immediately!

55
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,750
They asked for it.

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,292
That's what he gets
for using the mask of my first love.

57
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,083
Huh?

58
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,208
Y, Your first love?

59
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,583
Please go check on Fujiko.

60
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:12,917
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,667
Get a hold of yourself!
The ambulance will be here any minute!

62
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,583
Officer Sato...

63
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,500
It seems that Fujiko is just passed out

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,792
and not hurt that badly.

65
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:25,958
Right...

66
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,333
But, why did you commit a robbery

67
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,042
wearing such a mask like Lupin's?

68
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,792
K... Koumi... Island...

69
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,208
Koumi Island?

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,042
Oh... so you wanted money
to go play on that island...

71
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,500
N... No...

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,125
No, he says...

73
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,042
What is there on that island?

74
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,208
Jo... Jolly...

75
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Jolly Roger...

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,750
Jolly Roger？

77
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,125
Have you heard of it?

78
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,417
No...

79
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,792
（Koumi Island）

80
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
Hurry, hurry, mommy!!

81
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,125
Let's go!

82
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,250
Wait for me!

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,958
Um, how do you use this?

84
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,125
I'll show you.

85
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,833
Teacher! What kind of fish are there here?

86
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,458
May I have your name
you made reservations under...?

87
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,917
Kogoro Mouri, a detective...

88
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,000
two adults, two students

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,458
and five children...

90
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,000
One moment please...

91
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,417
There's a weekly puzzle
on Nichiuri Newspaper,

92
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,792
the really difficult one...

93
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,792
If there are no winners,
the prize money accumulates

94
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,167
and it finally reached 300,00 yen!!

95
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:08,125
And, just who do you think
won that 300,000 yen?

96
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,333
I, I don't know...

97
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,875
Oh, don't tell me that you...

98
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,708
Right...!!

99
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,542
I mean I'm a detective after all,

100
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,708
so I can solve puzzles hands down...

101
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,292
Well, I'm the one who solved it, though...

102
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:24,792
With 300,000 yen,
we can relax in Paris... right?

103
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:28,417
The city of Paris is just the place for me...

104
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,792
But, I thought about it,

105
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,042
thinking whether it's okay for me alone
to enjoy myself.

106
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,333
I thought that I may as well

107
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,333
share the enjoyment with all of them...

108
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,875
That's what I thought... Kind, aren't I?

109
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,375
W, Well...

110
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,625
And, what's our room number?

111
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry,

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,583
but it seems
we don't have reservations for you...

113
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,042
No kidding?

114
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,042
Hey, hey.

115
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,125
H, Hey, hold it!

116
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,958
I made reservations for sure!!

117
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,708
But your name
is not listed on the reservation list...

118
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,083
You mean we have to sleep outside...?

119
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,958
This island is a subtropical island

120
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,125
so I'm sure there are poison insects too...

121
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,167
We shouldn't have come...

122
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, I guess something can be worked out,

123
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,167
because this is not a foreign country

124
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,167
where we don't
understand the language or anything...

125
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,500
You're so adult, Ai...

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Well, it's for sure she's not childish...

127
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,083
Since the front desk said
they'd call the tourist bureau

128
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,750
there should be nothing to worry about...

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,792
But the person on the phone definitely said,

131
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,250
I've taken your reservation!

132
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,250
I understand sir, but...

133
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,625
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

134
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,333
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

135
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,750
The detective...

136
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,250
I'm sorry,
I'm Iwanaga from the tourist section.

137
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,958
(Iwagana supervisor of tourism)
You see, since this month,

138
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,083
the number of tourists
have increased suddenly,

139
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,583
that all the hotels are full

140
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,375
and everyone here is jumping for joy.

141
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,708
However, I've somehow
found a lodge for all of you.

142
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,458
I mean, after all,
you're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri...

143
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,750
Please come along with me...
I'll show you the way...

144
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,292
Strange...

145
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,375
What did he do?

146
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,000
Who are they?

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,083
Treasure hunters, maybe?

148
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,417
Treasure hunters?

149
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,333
Do they pull out hair?

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Tweezers Hunters, right?

151
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,708
No, Genta.

152
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,500
They are people who go around the world
to look for treasure.

153
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,625
How did you figure out

154
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
that they're treasure hunters...?

155
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,375
Yeah... take a good look at them...

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,125
Those people were all sun tanned but,

157
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,375
other than wrist up and neck up,

158
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,292
they weren't all that tanned were they?

159
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,417
That's proof that
they're always wearing wet suits...

160
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:53,167
Besides, the color of their hair
was also washed out by seawater...

161
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,625
But,

162
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,083
they could also just be plain divers...

163
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
That's true too, but...

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,917
with a poster like that around

165
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,708
It's hard not to think so, right?

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,083
Koumi Island
Underground palace

167
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,458
Ancient treasures hidden underneath

168
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,583
-Treasure!
-Treasure!

169
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,500
Yeah...

170
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,042
I'm sure they have their hopes high...

171
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,917
about treasure that is
lying asleep in the sea...

172
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,875
（Detective Conan Jolly
Roger in the Deep Azure）

173
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,917
I'm a high school detective
called Shinichi Kudo...

174
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,875
Huh? I don't look
like I'm in high school?

175
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,208
She is Ran Mouri,

176
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,833
my childhood friend
and classmate...

177
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,750
When I was dating Ran
at an amusement park,

178
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,125
I happened to witness an evil deal that
some suspicious men in black were making.

179
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,125
I was so absorbed in watching
the deal that I wasn't aware of

180
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,167
the footsteps of another member
that was approaching from behind me.

181
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,542
That man made me drink a drug,

182
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,667
and when I got up...

183
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,625
My body was shrunk!!

184
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,167
If they find out that
Shinichi Kudo is alive,

185
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,500
they would come
after my life again,

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,917
and would put the
people in danger too.

187
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,125
Thanks to Dr. Agasa's advice,

188
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,292
I decided to hide
my true identity,

189
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,458
and when Ran asked
me for my name,

190
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,500
I answered,

191
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,458
Conan Edogawa.

192
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,250
In order to get
information on them,

193
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,500
I decided to free-load
at Ran's house

194
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,333
being that her father was
running a detective agency...

195
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,125
This man here is Ran's father,

196
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,000
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

197
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,042
He is the so-called
"Sleeping Kogoro.

198
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,083
The reason is...

199
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,750
this...

200
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,875
She is Sonoko Suzuki...

201
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,667
She is Ran's classmate

202
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,208
and a carefree girl that doesn't seem
to be a least bit of a rich little lady

203
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,417
that she actually is.

204
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,000
This man here is Dr. Agasa.

205
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,000
He makes unique devices
for me one after the other

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,625
for I who have shrunk.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,833
She is Ai Haibara...

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Her real name is Shiho Miyano...

209
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,250
She was originally a
member of the men in black.

210
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,917
When she fled from
the organization,

211
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,250
She drank the same drug
that I was forced to drink

212
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,000
and her body shrunk.

213
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,125
I still can't make out the
identity of the men in black, but,

214
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,917
I'll settle things out with them

215
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,208
in the name of being
a famed detective!!

216
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,167
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

217
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,125
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan!!

218
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,458
There is only one
and only truth!!

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,542
I wonder why

220
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,250
treasure hunters are here...?

221
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,417
Oh, treasure was found
about two weeks ago.

222
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,667
Huh? Treasure was found?

223
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,667
You mean the silver
dish that was found

224
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,458
in the underground
palace was genuine?

225
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,208
It seems to have been so...

226
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,917
An underwater palace...

227
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:12,375
See, there's a little
uninhabited island there, right?

228
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,458
That's Yorioya Island.

229
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,292
About 200 meters east of
it at the bottom of the sea

230
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,875
is a building that is
made of gigantic rocks...

231
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:27,083
About 10 years ago, the
talk of an ancient ruins

232
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,042
being sunk near Koumi Island began.

233
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,917
A lot of scientists came to check on it

234
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:33,958
but whether it is man-made

235
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,458
（Underwater Palace）
or whether it is a work of nature

236
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,958
is not known yet.

237
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,833
Yorioya Island seems to have been

238
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,708
further out above the ocean

239
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,250
but seems to have sunk due to
the earthquake that occurred 300 years ago,

240
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,750
and ended up shaped like it is now...

241
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,333
Sunk because of an earthquake?

242
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,083
Was there a landslide or something?

243
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,458
Yeah, it seems that the area has

244
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,625
what is called a methane hydrate layer,

245
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,250
and due to the shock of the earthquake

246
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,917
it broke apart all together
causing a landslide.

247
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,250
This seems to be the view
held by most people.

248
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, Conan...

249
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,542
What's that thing
metan handmade all about...?

250
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,083
Methane hydrate...

251
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,125
In a low temperature
high pressure environment,

252
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,208
a water molecule takes in the methane

253
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,458
and creates a cage structure.

254
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,708
It is also known as "Burning ice."

255
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,167
Burning ice... ？

256
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,875
Cage structure... ？

257
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,750
Sounds Greek to me...

258
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,708
to put it simple, it's like this.

259
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,292
You've made a castle using
playing cards before, haven't you?

260
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,667
In other words, you make a castle
with water molecules

261
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,292
and then put methane
in each of the rooms of the castle.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,042
So, when the temperature rises
or the pressure goes down

263
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,292
it becomes unstable,

264
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:48,125
is squashed and marsh gas is emitted.

265
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,208
I see!

266
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,542
That's why if an island were on it,

267
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,208
it would lose support
and a landslide occurs!

268
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,083
Well, a very simplified explanation
would be so.

269
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,333
I saw it on TV some time ago!!

270
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,750
Oh... is that so...

271
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,125
Nuts...

272
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,458
Excuse me Mr. Mima,

273
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,542
I'm Iwanaga from the tourist bureau.

274
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,417
Mr. Mima, are you in?

275
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,958
Mr. Mima... Hey...

276
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,458
This place is really different
from the hotel we just left a while ago...

277
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,583
Yes...

278
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,250
I'm sorry, he doesn't seem to be in...

279
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,667
I did phone him though...

280
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,417
Cut out the noise!

281
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,958
Oh, Mr. Mima,

282
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,125
(Mr. Mima owner of Koumi hotel)
here're Mr. Mouri and his group

283
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,375
that I phoned you about a while ago.

284
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,042
It'll be 5,000 yen
for one night with two meals...

285
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,458
If you don't like it you can go on elsewhere.

286
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,042
H, Hey, M, Mr. Mima?!

287
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,917
What an inhospitable guy.

288
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,083
I'm sorry. He's a good person,

289
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,625
but a bit eccentric...

290
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,292
Uh... who will be participating
in the treasure hunt game?

291
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,792
We will...!!

292
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,750
Same here!

293
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,542
And you ladies are going diving, right?

294
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:58,792
Yes.

295
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,667
If you're going right away,
I'll take you there by car.

296
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,958
Will you please.

297
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,667
What will you two do?

298
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,875
The treasure hunt game
is pretty interesting, you know.

299
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,042
I'll just take it easy,
so don't worry about me.

300
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,417
Mr. Mouri,
will you join the treasure hunt...?

301
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,042
No...

302
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,333
Please tell me where I can go
to drink some local liquor

303
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,250
at a pub owned by a beautiful lady.

304
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:28,583
Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki...

305
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,208
You want to rent the full set, right?

306
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,333
-Yes!
-Yes!

307
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,292
Kimiko!

308
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,542
Yes.

309
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,375
(Yamaguchi Kimiko)
Are these wet suits okay?

310
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,042
I think you'll both fit into a medium.

311
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:42,875
Yes.

312
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,958
Just fine.

313
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,208
I'm glad...

314
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,667
since we don't have
too many wet suits available...

315
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,042
Don't worry about it.

316
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,125
Nice wet suits.

317
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,417
You think so?

318
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,667
Sorry to bother you...

319
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:59,833
Hey, wait you guys,
clean up before you leave!!

320
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,750
We'll come again...

321
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,375
They're treasure hunters, right?

322
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,875
Are they diving with us?

323
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,125
No,

324
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,958
all we did was rent them the air compressor.

325
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,750
People like them have increased lately

326
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,333
that we're finding it tough to handle too.

327
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,208
Oh, because the silver dish was found...

328
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,667
On top of that,
the story that Anne who escaped from prison

329
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:27,125
hid the treasure on this island
is going around too.

330
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,458
Who's Anne?

331
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,417
This...

332
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:35,667
270 years ago, in the Edo period
between the years of 1716 to 1735,

333
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:40,167
there is a story that an underwater palace
emerged above water.

334
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,875
This story is based on the fact

335
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,042
that a sword called the Cutlass

336
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,333
and a pistol
were found in the underwater castle.

337
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,375
From the initials
carved in the Cutlass and pistol,

338
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,667
it is thought that the weapons were owned by,

339
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,458
two women pirates who existed around 1730,

340
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,500
called Anne Bonny and Mary Read...

341
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,417
They were on board a pirate ship
lead by Captain Jack Rackam.

342
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,458
Huh? Women pirates?

343
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,333
Yes!

344
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,792
Anne Bonny and Mary Read...

345
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:16,083
They were crews on board
a pirate ship lead by Captain Jack Rackam.

346
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,583
I hear that when they were
attacked by the English troops,

347
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,875
despite the other male crew
hiding in the hold,

348
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,917
the two women fought gallantly
with their back against each other...

349
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,542
Oh... with their backs against each other...

350
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,458
Yes, they would leave
the enemies behind them

351
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,042
to be taken care of by their partner

352
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:36,167
and concentrate only on the enemies
who are in front of them.

353
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,917
It's a feat that cannot be carried out
unless you trust each other.

354
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,417
Ran...

355
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:46,833
I, I have my mind set that you're
the only one I can trust my back to...

356
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,542
S, Sonoko...

357
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,625
So I'd like to say.

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,833
But, I know for you, it's Shinichi, right?

359
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,875
I'd never!

360
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,333
Really?

361
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,750
Really!

362
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,875
Anne who escaped
from a prison in the Bahamas,

363
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,333
moved her stronghold to the Pacific,

364
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,083
and while pirating,

365
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,958
waited for Mary to break out of prison,

366
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,250
it is said that the treasure

367
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,000
that the two robbed

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,458
are hidden on Koumi Island here.

369
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:23,000
So, let's all look for the treasure
hid by Anne and Mary!!

370
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,833
I wonder if these are genuine...?

371
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
Beats me...

372
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,667
If they're for real, it'll make the news.

373
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,500
I'll bet this is just something
that was made up to advertise this island.

374
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,292
That'll also make the news...

375
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,417
Either way, they'll make the news.

376
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,042
Sorry, sorry.

377
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,208
I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting for so long...

378
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,250
Hey, hey...

379
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,125
Here you go, this is the treasure hunt map...

380
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,792
You start from here,

381
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:55,833
and find the 5 points that are hidden
on this map, and get it stamped each time.

382
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,875
Then, you solve the mystery.

383
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,208
The first point is there!

384
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,125
Stamp the empty space
on the bottom of the map,

385
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,958
and from the treasure chest next to it

386
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,417
take out the hint card for the next point.

387
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,042
It's a kid's game...

388
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,583
Oh come on, don't say that.

389
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,792
They're all out to get, you know...

390
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,625
10 and 12...

391
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,292
Is this the key that indicates
the whereabouts of the treasure...?

392
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,250
The next point is,

393
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,875
"The sun may set, but a pirate still shines."

394
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,208
What does that mean?

395
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,042
Give it your best shot.

396
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,750
If you figure out where the treasure is

397
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,625
you'll get a special gift!

398
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,000
Is, Is the special gift something to eat?

399
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,542
You'll see when you find the treasure.

400
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,458
Okay, let's go for it!!

401
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,292
We don't know if it's something to eat yet,
you know...

402
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,417
Uh, sir...

403
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:44,083
Huh, what is it?

404
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,417
Did you think up all these codes?

405
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,917
Well.

406
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,208
sort of...

407
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,625
there are rental bicycles
at the government building next door

408
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,958
so ride them.

409
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,208
It's too tough
searching for the treasure on foot.

410
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,625
Okay!

411
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,458
You're all for it, aren't you, Shinichi...

412
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,333
Okay! All done!

413
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,292
Okay then... Do as Kimiko tells you to

414
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,333
and enjoy safe diving...

415
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,875
Be careful especially of
the South side of the castle.

416
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,500
There are sharp crevices there...

417
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,625
Please don't scare us.

418
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,167
You'll be just fine,
because I'm going to be with you.

419
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,208
That's right.

420
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
-We're counting on you.
-We're counting on you.

421
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,542
You're back early,

422
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,042
what's up?

423
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:00,917
Sharks!

424
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,958
Since the hint said sunset

425
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,083
we came to the west most cape of the island

426
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,042
but... where in the world
is the treasure chest...?

427
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,167
I see! I get it!!

428
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,042
The hint was "the sun may set but,

429
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:21,042
pirates still shine", right?!

430
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,417
That is none other than...

431
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,333
the surface of the sea!

432
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,708
I see...!

433
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,042
So?

434
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,167
You mean the stamp is on the sea?

435
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:34,500
Oh, well...

436
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,500
of course not,

437
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,417
Uh, look at that...

438
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,708
I wonder what it is...

439
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,583
Maybe a fish...?

440
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,458
Isn't it an eel?

441
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,708
They wouldn't be in a place like this...

442
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,000
I see...

443
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,125
Hey, Conan...

444
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,500
What do you see?

445
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,292
Did you figure something out?

446
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,833
Do you know why the fish are gathered?

447
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,208
Why...

448
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,125
Were they playing together...?

449
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,708
Maybe they were hungry and eating together?

450
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,917
Right...

451
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,167
And what is it they're eating?

452
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,417
Plankton... maybe?

453
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,458
Right...

454
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:31,250
Wow...

455
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,667
Whoppers...

456
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,375
What's supposed to be here...?

457
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,375
Watch...

458
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,042
Wow...!

459
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,958
Sea fireflies!

460
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:45,958
I see!

461
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,917
The sun may set but the pirate still shines

462
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,625
means this, right?

463
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:51,792
There it is!

464
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,583
"A thin pirate laughs" it says.

465
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,125
Y, You laugh even if you're thin, right?

466
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,500
What's the matter, Ai?

467
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,625
A blood smeared person wearing a wet suit

468
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,292
was carried away just now.

469
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,167
What?!

470
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,917
I don't know if it was Ran or not but...

471
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,042
Oh, Conan?

472
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:22,250
Conan and I are going to be gone for a while

473
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,333
but continue the treasure hunt, okay?

474
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,667
Ai left too...

475
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,250
Don't worry,

476
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,750
you still got me, right?

477
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,833
Let's find the treasure without them!

478
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,500
Yeah... I guess so...

479
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,750
R, Ran...

480
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
Conan...

481
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,500
Ai too...

482
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,250
A, Are you all right?

483
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,333
Yes, we are...

484
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,458
(Mr. Uehira Koumi island policeman)

485
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,292
How is he, Mr. Uehira?

486
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,750
Oh, Kimi-chan.

487
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,750
Were you with him too, Kimi-chan?

488
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,167
No, I was nearby diving with them...

489
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,333
But, it sure surprised me

490
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,417
to see a shark attack a man...

491
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,208
Moreover,
there were three people all together

492
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,875
but only one man was attacked...

493
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,542
Just what do you mean by that?!

494
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,917
Nothing really...

495
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,500
Oh boy... what a bummer...

496
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,792
There hasn't been troubles
with sharks for years and yet...

497
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,542
This is the first time I've seen sharks
in that area to begin with...

498
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,792
Is anything the matter?

499
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:42,083
It's what Kimiko just said.
Three were diving

500
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,750
yet only one of them
was attacked, bothers me...

501
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,333
Just a coincidence, maybe?

502
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,833
If those guys were professionals,

503
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:51,000
they should know how to get rid of sharks,
shouldn't they?

504
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,167
Anything?

505
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,375
A vinyl bag...

506
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,208
Fish blood...?

507
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,333
That seems to have been the reason...

508
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,292
Yeah...

509
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,250
The blood of fish was poured into
a thin vinyl bag and sealed slightly.

510
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,750
Then the bag
was inserted between the jacket...

511
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,375
Water pressure increases 1 atmosphere
at a time, every 10 meters...

512
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,833
There is already 1 atmosphere above water so,

513
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,042
diving 10 meters makes it 2 atmospheres...

514
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,708
and 30 meters makes it 4 atmospheres...

515
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,625
If pushed with that much water pressure...

516
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:29,875
a vinyl bag like this
would open very easily...

517
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,083
Sharks can hear sound from
more than several kilometers away,

518
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,125
and has a sharp sense of smell
that can make out the smell of blood

519
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,667
that is diluted 1 million times...

520
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,333
Homicide...

521
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,917
Yeah...
although it's still attempted homicide.

522
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,542
Hey, glasses kid!!

523
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:00,333
What are you two whispering about...?

524
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,083
We've got a case, Pops.

525
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,542
What...?!

526
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,458
What didn't you report it?

527
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,042
To me... The great Detective Kogoro Mouri...

528
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,917
Oh...

529
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,125
What a huge mouth...

530
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:27,292
But, if he was bitten by a shark
isn't this an accident...

531
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,625
rather than a case?

532
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,208
What do you mean by, "Agh"...

533
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,542
What's this!

534
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,375
H, How is he, Doctor?

535
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,583
I've done all I could...

536
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,000
but he was bleeding so badly...

537
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,417
I'm sorry.

538
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,542
Damn!!

539
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,208
Oh my God!! To think that a person's died!!

540
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,875
No, this is not an accident.

541
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,417
Y, You're the famed Detective...

542
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,750
Kogoro Mouri.

543
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,750
Dad...

544
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,958
Mr. Mouri...

545
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,292
Hey, just what do you mean
by it's not an accident!

546
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:20,208
Someone lured the sharks to you
and made them attack you...

547
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,667
By using fish blood
poured into this vinyl bag

548
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:26,083
that was hidden in this BC jacket.

549
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:31,292
By the way,
I hear that you are treasure hunters...

550
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:33,792
There seems to be a lot behind this case...

551
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,042
Uh, Ran.

552
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,625
Where are the BC jackets usually placed?

553
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,708
Well...

554
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:46,625
you can't take it back
to the hotel room so...

555
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,958
I guess, they would have the diving shop
keep it for them around here?

556
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,458
So that they can have air put into air tanks
while they're at ti...

557
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,583
(The storage room)

558
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,750
If anything was done to the BC jacket,

559
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,833
it must've been done here...

560
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,000
If it were to be taken
and worked on it would be too risky.

561
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,000
Shinichi,
could I speak with you for a minute...?

562
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,292
What's up, Ai?

563
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,750
Take a look at this.

564
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:28,292
Since this is the place that seawater
is washed off from the equipment all the time

565
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,125
it seems to be muddy all the time...

566
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:34,083
Sorry, but will you take a picture
of this place with this,

567
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,167
because I have to go
check on something else...

568
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:36,917
Oh,

569
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,167
since when did I become your assistant...?

570
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,375
No, you're not my assistant...

571
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,500
but rather, my partner.

572
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,333
Smooth talker...

573
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,875
Okay then, I'm counting on you.

574
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:49,208
Yes, sir...

575
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,167
Uh, excuse me.

576
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,625
Huh? What is it...?

577
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,958
Is anyone at this shop at night?

578
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,917
Oh, are playing detective or something?

579
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,375
My house is behind here

580
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,125
and Kimiko's apartment is near the harbor

581
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,708
so there's nobody here at night.

582
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:13,917
Oh...

583
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:17,542
Besides, there are no thieves on this island,

584
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,083
so we usually don't even lock the shop...

585
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,375
Oh, Kimiko, you closed the shop last night,
didn't you?

586
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,250
Huh? Yes... but why?

587
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,583
Because this little detective
is giving me the third degree...

588
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,500
I see,

589
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,083
you're checking to see of anyone
rigged that BC jacket, right?

590
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:40,125
I'm the one who closed the shop last night,

591
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,208
as well as opened it this morning but,

592
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,042
I never lock the shop,

593
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,458
so anyone could've snuck in a rigged it.

594
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:50,958
How was it?

595
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,500
Did you come up with some clue?

596
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,542
No...

597
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,375
Nothing yet...

598
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,833
I hope you find something...

599
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,292
What's up?

600
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,875
What do you mean, what's up?

601
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,542
Just what do you think you're doing, Conan?!

602
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:11,292
If you don't come,
we can't find the pirate's treasure!

603
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:14,083
It's about time
you guys solve things on your own!

604
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,208
We can't do this on our own.

605
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,625
Where are you now?

606
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,750
We're heading for the suspended bridge!

607
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,333
Suspended bridge?

608
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,708
It's on the treasure hunt map.

609
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,542
On the treasure hunt map...

610
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,708
Oh I see it.

611
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,708
Hurry up and come then!

612
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,917
Yes, sir.

613
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,250
Hopeless...

614
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,833
Hey, Ai, are you coming?

615
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,250
I pass.

616
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,125
Ha, ha, ha, just as I thought...

617
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,958
Hey, he, what's this.

618
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,333
(Passage prohibited)
There's no road...

619
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,167
Darn it...

620
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,667
Huh?

621
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,625
Are you alone?

622
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,208
Yep. I think that everyone's on
the suspension bridge above.

623
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,042
I want to go there,

624
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,333
but the road is closed...

625
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,167
Oh I'm so sorry...

626
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:07,000
There was a landslide because of the
earthquake last week and the road closed up.

627
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,583
If you move a little more on ahead
there's a road where you can take a left,

628
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,167
so go there will you?

629
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,750
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Iwanaga.

630
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,333
Be careful. see you.

631
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,375
I will, bye.

632
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,083
Let's forget it. I can't figure it out.

633
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,458
We'll be fine if Conan comes.

634
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,875
We'll manage without Conan.

635
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,875
Let's figure this out on our own.

636
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,667
Huh?

637
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,000
There's a sign
on the other side of the suspended bridge.

638
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,042
Huh?

639
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,000
I wonder what it says...?

640
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Let's go see!

641
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,917
Okay!

642
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,375
I'm starving!

643
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,042
H, Hey, wait for me.

644
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,417
Wait!

645
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,833
Don't move!

646
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,792
W, Why not...

647
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,500
T, This...

648
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,458
(People over 40 kilograms
keep off the bridge)

649
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,625
What is it...

650
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,458
Genta, how much do you weigh?

651
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:26,667
T, Thirty nine kilos...

652
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:27,667
No.

653
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,792
I gained a bit and became 45 kilos!

654
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:33,250
No good.

655
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,333
This bridge

656
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,250
will fall if a person
more than 40 kilos goes across it.

657
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,708
N, No joke!!

658
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,542
Oh... I see!

659
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,417
"A thin pirate laughs."

660
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,750
This probably means to go across the bridge?

661
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,125
Right!

662
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,125
If a thin pirate laughs,

663
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,458
a fat one cries!

664
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,625
H, Help me... Mom!

665
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,708
I found it!

666
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,250
I wonder what it means,"Pirates don't cry."

667
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,417
It's already 4:00,
so I guess we'll continue tomorrow.

668
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,208
Yep... but how should we go back...

669
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,750
True...

670
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,083
With Genta squatting over there,

671
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,583
if we both go back there,

672
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,458
the bridge will go down for sure...

673
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,500
Hey, what're you guys doing?!

674
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,458
Conan!... We found it!

675
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,458
Wow, you guys are pretty good.

676
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,458
The next hint is, "Pirates don't cry."

677
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:33,500
But if someone more than 40 kilos
gets on the bridge...

678
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,042
it'll probably fall...

679
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,958
Was... it written that way?

680
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:41,792
Oh no, it said
people over 40 kilos should not cross...

681
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,875
I see,

682
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,000
that's why, "A thin pirate laughs"...

683
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,750
Then it's okay, come on and cross the bridge.

684
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,125
That sign's just a hint.

685
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,083
People who are under 40 kilos

686
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,417
include only women and children.

687
00:35:56,417 --> 00:36:00,750
A code that only they can solve,
could never exist!

688
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,042
Hello there,

689
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:33,375
Inspector! Hello. But, I don't think
you needed to come all this way, Inspector...

690
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,542
Something was
bothering me a bit so...

691
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,042
In, Inspector!

692
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:39,375
Thank you for
coming out all this way!

693
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,667
Okay, I'd like you
to start questioning.

694
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,667
R, Roger!!

695
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:48,375
You're treating us as
if we were suspects...

696
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,958
(Izuyama Taro)
Aren't we more like victims?

697
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:55,208
If you're victims, why don't
you speak honestly like victims?

698
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,292
Do both of you,
remember seeing these two?

699
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,917
Beats me, I've
never seen them...

700
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:09,167
These two robbed a supermarket
in Shimbashi last night

701
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,750
and took off with the cash...

702
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,833
They said that you told them to do so...

703
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,583
They said it was for them
to become members of your group...

704
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,167
(Matsumoto Mitsushi)
Beats me...

705
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,875
They're probably lying to get away...

706
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,042
Why you!!

707
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,542
You got proof? Evidence?!

708
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,667
All you've got are their testimonies, right?!

709
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,500
Cool it, okay...

710
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,917
Let's cool head everyone...

711
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,500
Here, have a cold drink.

712
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,792
So... if you have nothing more to say,

713
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:57,708
I'd like to go back to my room
and get to bed...

714
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,542
So, you really have no idea

715
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,792
who is after you two, do you...

716
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,958
Mr. Matsumoto...?

717
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,000
No, not at all.

718
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,917
See you...

719
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,750
Uh... excuse me...

720
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,958
Will you please give me a match?
I forgot my lighter...

721
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,292
Here...

722
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,333
Thanks...

723
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,083
Thank you very much.

724
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:31,042
What a waste of time!

725
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:36,333
Uh... is it okay for me to start drinking,
Inspector...

726
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,917
I'm thirsty...

727
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:41,458
Go ahead... They don't seem to be involved...

728
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,750
I thought that we would at least
come up with their fingerprints but...

729
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,083
Yes... but even if
we did get their fingerprints,

730
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,917
it would take time for results
to be reached on this island,

731
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,375
whether the forensic officers
were to come here

732
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,125
or be it we send it to them..

733
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,042
Hmm...

734
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,708
By the way, Officer Takagi,

735
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:59,458
did you smoke cigarettes?

736
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:01,417
Cough, cough, I, I'm sorry... Cough.

737
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:05,167
Do you happen to have instant glue? Cough...

738
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,917
I hate to do this when we're eating but,

739
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,792
Dr. Agasa's pun quiz.

740
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,125
Right.

741
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,292
Hey, hey...

742
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,458
Finally...

743
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,917
I thought it was just about time.

744
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,625
In the fish kingdom next to the ruins
at the bottom of the sea,

745
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,292
the evil doings of
the previous king were exposed

746
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:35,125
and a sea bream became the next king...

747
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:39,208
Now, who was the previous king?

748
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,542
1. A squid,

749
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:41,792
2. An octopus,

750
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,375
3. A crab?

751
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,167
Well...?

752
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,625
Hmm...

753
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,042
I got it...

754
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,500
Number 3, the crab...!

755
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,792
Why?

756
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,458
He cut off the head of the one
he didn't like with his pinchers!

757
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,750
Oooh... that's terrible!

758
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,292
Hey, hey.

759
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:04,333
It's a bit cruel, isn't it...?

760
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,125
I'm sorry...

761
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,083
I think it's an octopus.

762
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,625
Oh, and why is that?

763
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:13,917
The octopus king tried to take the treasure
of the kingdom all for himself.

764
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,375
Please imagine the looks of an octopus.

765
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,375
You mean monks with shaved heads
always make loads of profit, right?

766
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,625
Exactly.

767
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,083
don't think so.

768
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Then, I think it's number 1, a squid!!

769
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,708
Why...?

770
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,292
Leave it to me!

771
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:33,125
This time I know it's right.

772
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,500
The King... Oc-to(ok)pus(purse)...

773
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,167
and the squid

774
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,042
squealed,

775
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,417
squealed?

776
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,167
so the previous king was the squid...!

777
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,708
T, That's correct...

778
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,708
I wonder if you can call it a pun...

779
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,083
-Oh... Conan!
-Oh... Conan!

780
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,958
This is what you really call

781
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,000
squealing...

782
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,833
It sure is a nice moon...

783
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,042
Yeah...

784
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,125
No offense, but why did you decide
to run an inn, Mr. Mima?

785
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,417
Well, since I live alone,

786
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:18,083
I could somehow make ends meet
on fishing alone but...

787
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,958
I was asked to do so by the tourist bureau.

788
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,375
It seems that want to increase tourists...

789
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,625
I see...

790
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:30,542
We could be getting in the way your lives...

791
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,625
This is way better
than the life of a treasure hunter...

792
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,542
Talking of treasure hunter,

793
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,208
does the treasure really exist?

794
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,292
Phooey...

795
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:44,792
Hyenas don't gather where there's no prey...

796
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:49,042
Though it may not be the prey
that they're after...

797
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,917
I don't understand it...

798
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,167
Pirates don't cry.

799
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:56,333
Please think a lot harder, Genta.

800
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,792
Hey, kid.

801
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,708
Is "Pirates don't cry" a hint?

802
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:02,542
Yes, that's right...

803
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:05,417
I understand, "Pirates cry"...

804
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,917
"Pirates cry"...?

805
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,792
That could be a hint...

806
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:13,500
Do you want me to take you there now?

807
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,542
Huh? Are you going out from now?

808
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:18,500
It's already dark outside,
so I think you should wait till tomorrow...

809
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,208
You can never tell
how the weather's going to be tomorrow...

810
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,000
Are you saying it's going to be bad?

811
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,958
When the south wind blows strongly,
we don't go out fishing...

812
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,750
because the sea will be stormy...

813
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,292
Wisdom that comes from experience!

814
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,833
Then, why don't we all go.

815
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,583
It's good to take a walk after dinner...

816
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,792
Aye...

817
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:44,000
And, what do you propose to do,
Officer Takagi?

818
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:48,792
This is uh... called the method,
and the vapor of cyanoacrylate,

819
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:53,583
which is the substance of this instant glue,

820
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,958
reacts to the fluid that is secreted.

821
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,958
In this way fingerprints can be taken...

822
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:01,708
All we need to do is now
is wait for some time

823
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,750
until the fingerprints emerge.

824
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,833
Oh...

825
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,333
Since when did you learn
something like that?

826
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,417
Well,

827
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,625
I saw it on a movie I saw some time ago,

828
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,875
and confirmed with Officer Tome
if it could really be done.

829
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,875
Well, I sure hope it works out
as well as it did in the movie...

830
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:31,833
Is the answer for the hint
pirates don't cry over here?

831
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,625
I don't know about the answer...

832
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,542
But, this is the place

833
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,375
that cries.

834
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,042
Cries... Is it this wind?

835
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:42,000
It sounds like it's crying.

836
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,333
Oh, yeah really.

837
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,292
We heard it all the way here too, though...

838
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:49,125
Oh... Of course I know...

839
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:55,000
The sand here sure has
a large composition of quartz...

840
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,417
The size of the grains is also very small...

841
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,958
I see.

842
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:08,708
H, Hey, Conan?

843
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,625
Did you figure something out?

844
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,542
Listen carefully.

845
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:15,750
Wow...

846
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,167
It's crying sand!

847
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:20,708
I see! That's why, it's "pirates cry"!

848
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,625
The rest is up to you to solve!

849
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,000
I know!

850
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:28,750
Let's see, it was "Pirates don't cry".

851
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,708
That's it!

852
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,250
Look! It doesn't cry on this side!

853
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,208
That side is where the pirates don't cry.

854
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,417
Just as expected...

855
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:58,417
Next, it's "The soul of pirates
ascend to the heavens"...

856
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:01,000
Hmm... I still don't get it...

857
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,250
That tourist bureau section
sure can think things up...

858
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,458
The tourist bureau section chief,
Mr. Iwanaga...

859
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:11,042
He said that he thought up these codes
by himself, didn't he?

860
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:11,750
Oh...

861
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,875
Isn't that his job, though?

862
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,333
Doesn't anything ever move you?

863
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,333
Is anything the matter?

864
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,083
What's the matter, Conan?

865
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:30,458
This is getting to be very interesting!

866
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,125
Conan?

867
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,625
I'm sorry,
but I've got to stop over some place,

868
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,000
so go on home ahead of me, okay!

869
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,542
H, Hey, Conan!

870
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:39,625
There he goes again...

871
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,792
He really can't work in a group, can he...

872
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:43,958
Conan...

873
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,375
There...

874
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,292
All we need to do now is get this data
and e-mail it over.

875
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,000
Then, we can get the results right away.

876
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,125
You did it, Officer Takagi!

877
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,583
It's nothing... Ha, ha, ha...

878
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,250
If you want to transfer
to the forensic department,

879
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,542
let me know.

880
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,875
If it's okay with you,
I'll write the letter of recommendation.

881
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,333
N, No... Ha, ha, ha...

882
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,750
Get that over to headquarters ASAP.

883
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,958
Yes, sir!

884
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:53,667
What're you doing?!

885
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,125
Oh...

886
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,958
I was taking a walk and got lost...

887
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,958
Which way... is Koumi Villa?

888
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,750
That way...

889
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,333
Thank you... Goodnight...

890
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,917
How about it, Officer Takagi,

891
00:47:10,917 --> 00:47:12,750
any word from headquarters...?

892
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,792
Nothing yet.

893
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:16,042
I see...

894
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:20,250
What's up?

895
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,792
It, It's the alarm of the tourist bureau...

896
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,750
Which means that something happened
at that tourist bureau?

897
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,417
No, it malfunctions frequently so...

898
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:38,833
Let's go there anyway, just in case.

899
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,792
Where is it?

900
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,875
It, It's next to the village office...

901
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,083
Please lend me your car!

902
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,083
O, Okay...

903
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:47,250
I think you'll get word from headquarters
so keep on the look out for it!

904
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,458
Y, Yes, sir...

905
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:07,375
I tell you,
what's with the chain of cases recently...

906
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,792
Wha! It, It's come...

907
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,083
Uh...

908
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,875
T, This is...

909
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,000
Hurry, get in!

910
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I asked if there were...

911
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,917
any shops run by a beautiful owner...
a pretty hostess...

912
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:46,958
Ugh... Uuugh...

913
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:55,375
I'm not even allowed to drink in quiet...

914
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,625
That's why I don't like tourist sites...

915
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm going to really get pissed, you know...

916
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,333
cut out the noise!

917
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What's going on?

918
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,333
Hey, hold it!!

919
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,375
Just what do you think you're doing?!

920
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,458
Tourist bureau chief, is this the place
run by a beautiful owner

921
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,917
or what...!!

922
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,500
Who cares,

923
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,167
she's beautiful
if you look at her in the dark...

924
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,667
Take responsibility, will you...!

925
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,250
I'm busy...!

926
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,125
Why...

927
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:26,542
The exhibition room of the tourist bureau
was broken into...

928
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:27,708
What?!

929
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,917
Broken into?

930
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:29,750
Move it!!

931
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,875
Hey, wait?!

932
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,292
Get on, quick!

933
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:35,167
If you don't get on quickly,
I'm leaving you here!

934
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,750
W, Wait.

935
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,792
Hang on tight! I'm going to rev this thing!!

936
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:42,125
Hey, wait... Pay your bill...!!

937
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,250
Hey, mister...

938
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,250
What's up?

939
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Oh, Officer, he drank
and ran off without paying the bill.

940
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,208
Arrest him, will you!

941
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,875
Give me a break... another incident...

942
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,958
The exhibition case
was cracked open with a bar...

943
00:50:58,542 --> 00:50:59,833
How daring...

944
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:05,833
Oh, how about it, Officer Sato...

945
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,167
Yes, just like Conan said, they've been shot.

946
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,875
There are bloodstains left...

947
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,667
I see...

948
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:15,833
Do you think you can save the site?

949
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,667
That seems quite difficult...

950
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,167
I guess so...

951
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,583
Okay, then come over here
after taking pictures of the site then.

952
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,500
Yes, sir.

953
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,250
The Cutlass and pistol are...

954
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,792
Are they worth any value?

955
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,750
They are treasures that were
taken out of the undersea castle...

956
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,833
Anne Bonny's Cutlass

957
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:39,125
and Mary Read's pistol...

958
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:42,833
Now that I'm here,
you've got nothing to worry about.

959
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,250
Mr. Mouri... your face is red...

960
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,958
Oh... well... well...

961
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,083
Since everyone is here...

962
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,708
Kogoro Mouri, you're under arrest!!

963
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,833
Charges are bicycle theft

964
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,875
and drunk driving!

965
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:02,250
Whaaaat...!!

966
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,458
Hey, hey...

967
00:52:04,042 --> 00:52:05,917
Is, Is that true?!

968
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:06,875
Yes, sir.

969
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:09,167
He didn't pay for his drinks at the pub

970
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,750
and moreover, fled on Mr. Iwanaga's bicycle
after stealing it,

971
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,042
the owner of the pub said...

972
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,833
I didn't steal it and flee!!

973
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:17,917
I had the tourist bureau chief
ride in back of me and brought him here!

974
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,042
Right? Isn't it?

975
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:20,292
Y, Yes...

976
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,917
Oh, right, Inspector.

977
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:26,583
The result for matching
of the fingerprints arrived.

978
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,125
O, Oh, really?!

979
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,792
Koji Matsumoto,

980
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:35,125
is charged for stealing artworks
and excavated goods

981
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:38,792
from the ruins and museums... the world over,
as well as for murder...

982
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:39,875
He sure is one hell of a guy, isn't he...?

983
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,333
So, those guys were on
the international wanted list...

984
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,083
Darn, so they are after the treasure

985
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,333
of Anne and Mary after all...?

986
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,042
What do you mean by they're after?

987
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:53,667
Aren't the pistol and the Cutlass
the only things that were stolen?

988
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:55,292
Oh, well,

989
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:58,833
Anne Bonny and Mary Read
were women pirates...

990
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,000
But there is a legend that says that

991
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,667
the two women pirates
who were active some 300 years ago

992
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,583
hid some treasures here on Koumi Island...

993
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,583
You mean the treasures of these people
are really here?

994
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:13,833
Yes. The Cutlass and pistol that were here
is proof that other treasures exist.

995
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,083
Uh,

996
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,958
Pops didn't you go to a pub
owned by a beautiful woman?

997
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,500
She wasn't any beauty,

998
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,958
just a plain old lady.

999
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,333
Just as I thought...

1000
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,875
This smell is...?

1001
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,583
Pops, you got something on you...

1002
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,792
What's this...

1003
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,208
I see...

1004
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,625
How do you get off this island?

1005
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,958
There's only one regular boat
that leaves in the afternoon,

1006
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:55,000
so the only way out of here
are fishing boats.

1007
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,167
Okay, please let word out

1008
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,833
to be careful not to get boats stolen.

1009
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,375
Y, Yes sir!!

1010
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,250
Hey, what about these handcuffs!!

1011
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,625
Hey...!!

1012
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,583
Uh, Inspector Megure?

1013
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,417
Come to think of it, that man called
Matsumoto was giving Ms. Mabuchi,

1014
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,917
the owner of the diving shop
money or something.

1015
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:16,708
What?!

1016
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:19,917
Inspector Megure! I just got back.

1017
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:21,000
Good work.

1018
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,542
I'm sorry I have to tell you this right now
when you just got back,

1019
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:26,167
but it seems that Matsumoto got in touch
with the owner of the dive shop.

1020
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,750
Both of you, head for the dive shop...

1021
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,083
We'll go to the hotel Matsumoto's staying at!

1022
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:31,708
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1023
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:34,250
In, Inspector... The handcuffs...!

1024
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,125
How about it? The weather...

1025
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,833
The wind...

1026
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,875
The sun is out so I'm sure it'll be fine.

1027
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,375
Let's try enlarging it...

1028
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,542
The tread pattern is totally different...

1029
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,708
It's not this bicycle after all...

1030
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,417
Conan.

1031
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,625
Oh, Yes?

1032
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,583
Conan, it's meal time...!

1033
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:11,958
I'll be right over!

1034
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,625
What's the matter?

1035
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,125
It's like a GPS...

1036
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,000
A GPS?

1037
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,833
Why would it be set up on a bicycle?

1038
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,458
What the hell is Conan doing anyway!

1039
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,167
He'll be here any minute now,
so let's wait just a little more

1040
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,583
-See, there he is...
-Sorry to keep you waiting...

1041
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,083
You're late, Conan!

1042
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,625
I'm starved!

1043
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,083
Sorry, sorry...

1044
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,500
Huh? Where's Pops?

1045
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,250
Well, he said that he had to attend
an investigation conference

1046
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,083
and went to the government office.

1047
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:43,750
Now, since everyone is here...

1048
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,917
Dig in!!

1049
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,583
Let's eat!

1050
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,292
I never thought that this would be next!

1051
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,333
Yummy!

1052
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,458
Give me more!

1053
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,250
Uh... when you went to the suspended bridge,

1054
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,833
didn't you see Mr. Iwanaga?

1055
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,292
Mr. Iwanaga...

1056
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,500
Oh, the chief of the tourist bureau...

1057
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,667
Yeah...

1058
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,458
Nope, we didn't... did we?

1059
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,708
No...

1060
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,750
We found that place on our own!

1061
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,917
I see...

1062
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,750
Do you all have enough to eat?!

1063
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,042
Yes, we're just fine, thank you.

1064
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,750
By the way,
are you planning to dive today too?

1065
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,833
No,

1066
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,333
I'm too scared
after what happened yesterday...

1067
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:37,417
But, we may not have time tomorrow

1068
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,750
so we're thinking of
riding on a boat or something.

1069
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:43,167
I'd advise you not to go out
to see from afternoon...

1070
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,083
I'm sure the sea's going to be stormy...

1071
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:46,917
Oh, is that so, after all.

1072
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,542
Then, we'd better hurry
and look for the treasure too...

1073
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:51,750
Right,

1074
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,083
because we just have one more thing to solve.

1075
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,125
Let's give it our best shot, Conan.

1076
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:56,958
Oh...

1077
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,667
I... have to stop by some place...

1078
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,042
so you guys go on ahead on the hunt.

1079
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,542
Then let's just leave the you know who that
just can't seem to work in a group behind,

1080
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,833
find the treasure ourselves,

1081
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,417
and split it among ourselves!

1082
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:13,750
I agree...!!

1083
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,958
It's not on any of the bicycles, after all...

1084
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,625
Chief! It's the newest report
on low atmospheric pressure!

1085
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,375
What a bummer... A typhoon's on its way...

1086
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,792
Please contact the fishing association
and the hotels.

1087
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,625
Yes, sir.

1088
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,875
What a bummer...

1089
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,083
Matsumoto and Izuyama
are not back at the hotel.

1090
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,167
There are no traces
that they left the island either,

1091
00:57:57,167 --> 00:58:00,000
so they're probably in hiding somewhere...

1092
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,833
We know that
at least one of them has been shot,

1093
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,042
so he may need to be treated for his wound.

1094
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:08,875
I've checked with the clinic,

1095
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,792
but they haven't gone there.

1096
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:13,917
About Mabuchi, owner of the dive shop,

1097
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:16,542
it seems that what Conan witnessed
last night

1098
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:19,792
was the man asking her to get a boat
for the two men to flee from the island.

1099
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,000
I'd just like to inform you,

1100
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,750
that I don't have the slightest idea where
Matsumoto and his friend are hiding.

1101
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,625
Running a dive shop
doesn't bring in that much cash...

1102
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:31,292
That's why I agreed to get ready
what Matsumoto asked for.

1103
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,667
I guess I drew an unlucky lottery ticket...

1104
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,583
I see...

1105
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:39,458
This cartridge that Officer Takagi retrieved

1106
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,333
is something quite old,

1107
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,833
so I'm sure it's something
that has been stored away for a long time...

1108
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,500
Hmm, as for the rifle,

1109
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,000
we're having the Ryoyu Hunting Association
check on it.

1110
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,625
Come in...

1111
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,583
Excuse me,

1112
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:54,792
I just got a call from
the Ryoyu Hunting Association

1113
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:58,542
saying that the rifle of a member
called Mr. Mineo is missing...

1114
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,042
I see.

1115
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,917
And, who is this Mr. Mineo?

1116
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:05,375
Yes, he's an old man who lives alone,

1117
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,500
and relies on his niece

1118
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,042
Chika Mabuchi,
who runs a dive shop for a living.

1119
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,500
Please go and listen to what
Mr. Mineo has to say right away.

1120
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,250
And please ask Ms. Mabuchi
to come to the station voluntarily...

1121
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,417
Yes, sir!!

1122
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,958
Please get back the Cutlass and pistol
that were stolen!

1123
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,167
Please!

1124
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,542
We'll do our best!

1125
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:33,917
I wonder why they went in to steal it now

1126
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,292
knowing that we're all here, though...

1127
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:37,708
Yes...

1128
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,417
Only Officer Uehira alone
is normally on this island...

1129
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,917
so it would've been easier for them
to get off the island too...

1130
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,625
They were probably afraid of
taking their time

1131
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:48,333
for fear of their identities being disclosed.

1132
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:51,250
Is any more back up coming from Tokyo?

1133
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:54,542
It seems that
they can't dispatch any choppers or boats

1134
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,208
because of the low atmospheric pressure.

1135
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,125
We'll have to handle this on our own...

1136
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,625
We've got to find Matsumoto and his friend,

1137
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:06,292
and track down the one
who're after their lives...

1138
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,792
I found it...

1139
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:18,750
I found it!!

1140
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,917
All right...!

1141
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,417
The last one was simple, wasn't it?

1142
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:26,083
Yep! "The souls of pirates
ascend to the heavens"

1143
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,125
so there's no other place but the lookout!

1144
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,250
The stamped letters are the hints.

1145
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,958
Go on and find our treasure for us!

1146
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,833
The owner's gone
to check the ocean out right now,

1147
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,167
so wait a while please.

1148
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,125
-Okay...
-Okay...

1149
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,375
Thank you for waiting...

1150
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,375
I'm sorry...

1151
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,000
It's not possible to go out to sea after all.

1152
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,667
The waves are too high.

1153
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,167
Bummers...

1154
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,833
It can't be helped.

1155
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,417
Let's go to a quiet place on the beach
and spend time there then.

1156
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,125
Good morning, Officer Uehira.

1157
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,833
Oh, good morning.

1158
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,458
What's with that solemn look...

1159
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,292
Is something wrong?

1160
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:07,333
Chinatsu,
would you come with me for a minute?

1161
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,125
Inspector Megure
says he want to talk to you...

1162
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,917
Excuse me, mister...

1163
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:21,375
Huh? What is it?

1164
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:28,167
I wonder why those hunters
stole the Cutlass and pistol

1165
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,458
from the tourist bureau?

1166
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:36,583
If they're treasure hunters

1167
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:40,417
aren't they supposed to be
looking for treasure?

1168
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,917
Or did they steal those things

1169
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:44,083
because they're necessary
to find the treasure?

1170
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
That's why I think they're already

1171
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,542
headed for the place where the treasure is.

1172
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,000
Would you by chance know where it is, sir?

1173
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:56,250
Why are you asking me?

1174
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,042
Didn't you used to be...

1175
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,792
a treasure hunter too, sir?

1176
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:11,583
Even if I used to be
a treasure hunter in the past,

1177
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:15,958
that doesn't mean that I'd know
where the treasure is, would it?

1178
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:18,250
You mentioned yesterday that...

1179
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,125
Talking of treasure hunters,

1180
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:23,583
does the treasure really exist?

1181
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:28,375
Phooey... Hyenas don't gather
where there's no prey...

1182
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:31,958
Though it may not be the prey
that they're after...

1183
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:35,500
"It may not be the prey
that they're after... "

1184
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,583
means that you know what is hidden, right?

1185
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,208
Come...

1186
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,125
I wonder why the numbers
are divided into red and blue...

1187
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:00,958
Scissors.

1188
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,333
Oh, okay.

1189
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:07,375
There are two problems here...

1190
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:10,500
The reason why the numbers
are divided into blue and red,

1191
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,833
and the meaning of the numbers themselves.

1192
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:16,583
Maybe the numbers are
street addresses of places on this island.

1193
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,958
I see!

1194
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,750
Let's go ask go ask the man!

1195
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,083
Sir...!

1196
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,542
I wonder what Inspector Megure wants to talk
to Ms. Mabuchi about...?

1197
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,167
Maybe about the case...

1198
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,708
I'm sure it's some kind of mistake.

1199
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:39,833
Go ahead and get in.

1200
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:41,125
-Okay...
-Okay...

1201
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,583
Will you load this on together too...

1202
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:52,042
Hey, mister...?!

1203
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,125
You stay in the car.

1204
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:59,000
You don't want your friend to get hurt,
do you?

1205
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:27,292
Sir, did you used to
be a treasure hunter before?

1206
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,250
Yeah... when I was young...

1207
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:34,125
I came to this island to look
for the treasure hidden by Anne and Mary...

1208
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,875
and ended up living here...

1209
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:39,333
I fell in love with
a island lady and married her,

1210
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,125
and became a fisherman...

1211
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,208
This dates back 300 years.

1212
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,417
That's the story...

1213
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,583
This is the map
that everything is based on...

1214
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,250
The chief of the tourist bureau,
Iwanaga made it

1215
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,500
based on an old map just like this one...

1216
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,208
It's a code that no one has ever solved yet.

1217
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,417
It was thought up 300 years ago...

1218
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:22,167
by Anne Bonmny...

1219
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,542
Yeah...

1220
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,500
T, Then, don't tell me that ...

1221
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,583
if we solve this, we can get hold of
the real treasure...?

1222
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:30,250
Exactly...

1223
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:35,708
If this was made 300 years ago,
it's not a place or a street address.

1224
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:39,208
The most popular way of thinking
would be that they stand for alphabets...

1225
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,083
Uh... if so, "5" would be...

1226
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,667
"5" would be ... A, B, C, D, E,

1227
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:44,958
-an "E"!!
-Right...

1228
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:49,667
"7" is G

1229
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:50,458
"12" is...

1230
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,375
ABCDEFGHIJK,

1231
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,208
L...? M...?

1232
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,667
The 12th alphabet is "L"!

1233
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:57,958
L.

1234
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,458
This makes all of it, right?

1235
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,875
The red alphabets have been place on top

1236
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:18,625
and the blue alphabets
have been placed below...

1237
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:20,708
The only thing left now is combination...

1238
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,167
Maybe it's a name...?

1239
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:25,292
Maybe the red alphabets make the last name
and the blue the first name...?

1240
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,792
I think that's a pretty good guess.

1241
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,708
I wonder if it's a name
that has to do with pirates?

1242
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,125
Yeah, most likely.

1243
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,667
Look, look, if you place it like this,
it looks like a name.

1244
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:42,000
Jolly... is it?

1245
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:44,250
Jolly...

1246
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,750
Run for it both of you!!

1247
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:05,875
Don't move!!

1248
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,667
Ran...

1249
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:12,375
Phooey! You seem to be able
to use karate a bit,

1250
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:15,542
but you'd better stay still
or your friend's life is in danger...

1251
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:36,833
Our boat...

1252
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,250
Why is it in a place like this...

1253
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,458
I asked your owner for it.

1254
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:44,708
I paid her for it.

1255
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,625
N... No...

1256
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,542
This is as far as you come...

1257
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,167
There aren't enough air tanks.

1258
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:54,083
Kimiko!!

1259
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,208
Don't move!!

1260
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,333
Y, You, stay still...

1261
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,333
Get on the boat, quick!

1262
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:06,625
Hmm... this kind of stuff's
not my cup of tea...

1263
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,792
Then, how about this?

1264
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,625
How do you read it...?

1265
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,333
Uh... "Gro", I think?

1266
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,667
Jolly Gro?

1267
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:15,708
No...

1268
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,833
Roger!

1269
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,708
Jolly Roger...

1270
01:08:24,917 --> 01:08:26,208
Jolly Roger?

1271
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,250
Who's that?

1272
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,958
A famous pirate or something?

1273
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:32,583
Directly translated,
it would mean "Pleasant Roger."

1274
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,208
Jolly Roger

1275
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:40,333
is something that the seamen
around the 1700's hated to see...

1276
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,875
It is said that the name comes from

1277
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,750
Jolly Rouge, which means red flag

1278
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:48,167
or Old Roger which means devil...

1279
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:48,958
A flag?

1280
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,417
A devil?

1281
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,208
Yeah...

1282
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,833
Jolly Roger

1283
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:58,083
is the pirate flag, that's drawn there...

1284
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:00,292
Wow, Conan.

1285
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:04,417
You solved it.

1286
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,333
Yep. What's this?

1287
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,625
300 years ago

1288
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:13,958
a seaman who was on board a Spanish ship

1289
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,542
passed this island and drew this...

1290
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:19,833
After that, this island sunk into the sea...

1291
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:23,125
It is said that it was due to a thing
called Methane whatevers gas...

1292
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:31,167
Yorioya Island was previously much larger

1293
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,250
and protruding out of the sea,
but sank into the sea during an earthquake

1294
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,875
that occurred 300 years ago,
and became the shape it is now...

1295
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,458
Yorioya Island...

1296
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,500
The treasure is on this island?

1297
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,583
Yeah, most likely...

1298
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,083
But, sure there's still more, though...

1299
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:57,000
There should be a hint
that specifies the location even more...

1300
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,375
What's up, Conan?

1301
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:00,917
Did you find something?

1302
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:04,208
The Jolly Roger that
is drawn on the old map,

1303
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,208
The skeleton's teeth...

1304
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:09,042
Don't they look like some kind of letter?

1305
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,333
True...

1306
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,375
it looks like alphabet...

1307
01:10:17,042 --> 01:10:20,208
The top teeth look like D.O.S...

1308
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:25,500
and the bottom teeth D.I.O.S.A.S...

1309
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,708
Just what does it mean?

1310
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:29,417
Dos Diosas...

1311
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,833
(Dos Diosas = two Goddesses)
It means two Goddesses in Spanish.

1312
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,083
Wow...!

1313
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:38,125
Just as expected of you, Ai!

1314
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,875
That's as far as we go...

1315
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:42,167
We'll have to go to the island
to find out what's left.

1316
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:45,917
But weren't the hunters
searching inside the sea?

1317
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:48,292
Which means the treasure
is hidden in the sea?

1318
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,125
No, if so,

1319
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:53,250
there should be a hint
that indicates under the sea...

1320
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,375
Besides, the god of the sea is Poseidon,
a male god.

1321
01:10:56,667 --> 01:11:00,667
Those guys were probably
looking for another entrance.

1322
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:06,208
The entrance of the two goddesses collapsed
because of the earthquake last week,

1323
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:09,583
and it's become impossible
for adults to go through...

1324
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,958
They found the entrance...

1325
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,333
That's what despite knowing
that the police were here,

1326
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:19,333
they risked the danger
of robbing the Cutlass and the pistol...

1327
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,292
The woman from the dive shop?!

1328
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:27,750
What happened?!

1329
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,875
W... Where's Mr. Mouri...

1330
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,083
He's not here...

1331
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,875
He should be at the government office.

1332
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:36,333
Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped.

1333
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,375
On a b,boat...

1334
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,958
Who?! Who kidnapped them?!

1335
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,833
M... Matsumoto... the treasure hunter.

1336
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:49,500
They're headed for Yorioya Island.

1337
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:53,333
You guys, go to the government office
right away and inform Pops of this!

1338
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,458
Okay!

1339
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:02,583
Be careful.

1340
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:03,667
Yeah...

1341
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,208
Mr. Mima.

1342
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,208
Would get the boat out?

1343
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:16,708
I want you to take me to Yorioya Island...

1344
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,792
What?

1345
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,083
It's not for the treasure.

1346
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,208
I want to go rescue Ran and Sonoko...

1347
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:24,958
Shinichi?!

1348
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:27,417
Conan...

1349
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:29,875
I hear that Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped?

1350
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,042
Yeah...

1351
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,667
Even if I stop you,

1352
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,875
you have your mind set on
going to rescue them, don't you...?

1353
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:39,167
Hold on a sec...
There's something I'd like to give you.

1354
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,208
I'll go on ahead and get the boat ready...

1355
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:43,292
Okay...

1356
01:12:47,542 --> 01:12:49,375
Take this with you.

1357
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,708
It's a compact air tank...

1358
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,083
Pull over here.

1359
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,958
If you hold it in your mouth
you can breathe air for 10 minutes...

1360
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,125
It's too bad that I only have two,

1361
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,083
so these should be used
only as a last resort.

1362
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:02,792
Thanks, Doc...

1363
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:12,333
Both of use one tank together!

1364
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,458
Now that we're all the way here,
you don't need us anymore do you?

1365
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,458
We still have work we need you to do for us.

1366
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:22,500
Hurry up and get ready!

1367
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:35,083
Don't... tell me that...

1368
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,917
Sonoko!!

1369
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,625
It's show time, young lady.

1370
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,000
Just what do you want us to do?!

1371
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,667
Your turn's going to be a while later...

1372
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:52,875
What...

1373
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,583
Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped by Matsumoto?!

1374
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,292
And, where'd they go?!

1375
01:13:57,292 --> 01:13:59,250
Where else, but to the island!!

1376
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,542
Yorioya Island!!

1377
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,750
They found out where the treasure is,

1378
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,667
so they went to get it!

1379
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,375
Get a boat out for us immediately!!

1380
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,917
We've got to go rescue the girls!!

1381
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:09,458
O, Okay!!

1382
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:17,417
I wonder why they took hostages?!

1383
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:20,917
They'd only get in the way
of the treasure hunt!

1384
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:22,417
Those guys want to use the hostages!

1385
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:24,000
Use the hostages?!

1386
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:27,542
Those guys were shot yesterday and hurt!

1387
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:30,583
The place they're planning to dive today

1388
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,833
is the place where the sharks
attacked yesterday.

1389
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:35,417
You mean they're going to be used as bait...

1390
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:36,625
Most likely.

1391
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,333
Over there!!

1392
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,917
Just as I thought...

1393
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:08,125
Now, what? There isn't much time left.

1394
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,708
Please take me to Yorioya Island!

1395
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:10,792
What?

1396
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,583
I'm sure I can make it through the entrance
of the goddess,don't you think so too?

1397
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:24,667
There's not much air left...

1398
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:10,583
Well, well...

1399
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:12,625
It's amazing
that you made it through alive...

1400
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:15,542
Bring the torch that's over there
and come over here.

1401
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:17,333
You don't know the road, do you?

1402
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:21,917
You're going to die a miserable death
just standing there like that anyway...

1403
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,083
Stop dilly-dallying and walk!

1404
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:29,208
Hey, stop pushing me!

1405
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,375
Where is this...

1406
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,667
We've come up ahead here a lot of times...

1407
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,792
Today, we're here
to get hold of the treasure

1408
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,750
(from off) of Anne Bonny and Mary Read.

1409
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,625
You guys stay still over here for a while...

1410
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,833
If you climb a little ways up there,
you'll find a small shrine,

1411
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:59,625
and behind the two goddess statues
you'll find the entrance!

1412
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,958
I got it!!

1413
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:02,708
30 minutes is the limit.

1414
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,625
Otherwise,
we won't be able to make it back!!

1415
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,667
Okay, thank you!

1416
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:10,000
I'll rescue Ran and Sonoko for sure
and bring them back...!!

1417
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:19,292
Anne Bonny and Mary Read...

1418
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:37,583
Strange...

1419
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,500
It looks like a place
where even adults can pass through.

1420
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,375
The road is blocked because of a landslide

1421
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:44,042
caused by the earthquake last week.

1422
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:45,875
I see...

1423
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:48,000
the hole widened up again
due to the earthquake...

1424
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,042
D, Don't tell me that they...

1425
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:55,417
No, I don't think they'd bring the girls
all the way here,

1426
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,500
and do a thing like that.

1427
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,625
But...

1428
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:01,333
Matsumoto and his friend were shot
last night and are hurt...

1429
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,583
If they dive

1430
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:07,625
the sharks will smell blood
and gather around them.

1431
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:08,833
So, what?!

1432
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:14,250
I think they're going to use Ran and Sonoko
as decoy or something like that...

1433
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,375
Wait, Mr. Mouri!
Just what are you going to do?!

1434
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:20,958
Let me go!!
I can't just do nothing for Ran and Sonoko!!

1435
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,333
Don't Mr. Mouri, it's impossible

1436
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,542
because the weather is going to get worse!

1437
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:26,542
Never mind, just let go of me...!!

1438
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:27,708
Excuse me.

1439
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:30,667
Ugh?!

1440
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,958
What now?

1441
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,250
We've no choice but to go back...

1442
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,250
although it's very regrettable.

1443
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:48,542
Go inside already... It's dangerous outside.

1444
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:54,375
But, Conan, Ran and Sonoko...
are in greater danger...

1445
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,167
Yes...

1446
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:56,542
True...

1447
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,583
The water's receding...

1448
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:07,083
It must be low tide...

1449
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,917
Don't tell me we're headed for that hole...?

1450
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:10,500
Exactly...

1451
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:13,792
That hole is the secret path
to the treasure...

1452
01:21:14,417 --> 01:21:17,500
Okay, bring that air tank and follow me.

1453
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:38,292
The pirate story was true...

1454
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,292
I guess so...

1455
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,417
Put the air tanks down and go on ahead!

1456
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:59,083
B, But...

1457
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,708
Shut up and go!

1458
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:12,583
Yikes!!

1459
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,083
Bones! Bones! Bones...

1460
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:18,792
Whew... I guess it's okay this time.

1461
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,042
Gas...

1462
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:21,958
Gas?

1463
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:26,292
Depending on the wind, there are times
when gas is accumulated in this room.

1464
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,708
That's why
you made us walk in front of you...

1465
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,208
What do you think we brought you along for?

1466
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,042
Whew... Hurry up and walk!!

1467
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,625
What?

1468
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
This!

1469
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,250
I found it...

1470
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:54,000
Phooey... what an idiot.

1471
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:56,792
He loses his life
because he tries to open the door

1472
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,625
by inserting something like this.

1473
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,667
This should do it...

1474
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,583
You, go on and open it!!

1475
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:15,750
Me?!

1476
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,292
I'll do it.

1477
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:29,583
Ran!!

1478
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:31,917
Shoots, no good after all...

1479
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,833
Why don't you guys just give up already!

1480
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,875
I see, so that's what it is.

1481
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:47,917
Did you figure it out?

1482
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:52,375
Anne and Mary seems to have fought
with their backs against each other's...

1483
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,333
In other words...

1484
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,958
This is what it means.

1485
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,875
We did it... did it boss...

1486
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:21,625
Hey, lend me the light.

1487
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,708
Wow...

1488
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,917
The treasure... Where's the treasure...?

1489
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,833
Ha, ha... hold your horses, ha, ha, ha.

1490
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,167
Ran... what now?

1491
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,917
We could make a run for it now,
but we'd half to float up the sea,

1492
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:58,750
which is going through a storm
without an air tank.

1493
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,042
True...

1494
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:03,125
We've no choice
but to wait here for help to come...

1495
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:04,875
So... I guess so...

1496
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:11,833
Wind...

1497
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:13,083
It's connected...

1498
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:16,000
Darn! It's not here!!

1499
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,708
There's no treasure anywhere!

1500
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:21,375
No treasure, not even one measly coin!!

1501
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:23,333
I don't know who it is,

1502
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:27,292
but the one that came here before us
took every last penny out of here!

1503
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:29,042
Hey, what's this about?

1504
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,250
I came all the way here

1505
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,000
because you said
there'd be a mountain of treasure!!

1506
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,833
Shut up! Zip your mouth!!

1507
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:40,750
We've got no choice...
Let's get out of here fast.

1508
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,667
After getting rid of the load
we don't need anymore.

1509
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:50,833
Sorry...

1510
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,458
this is your fate, girls...

1511
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,583
D, Don't move!!

1512
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,667
Ran, I'm leaving behind me to you, Ran.

1513
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,417
Okay, got you.

1514
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:04,833
Why you!

1515
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:17,500
Darn, this chick is strong!!

1516
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,917
Fuh... You can say that again...

1517
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:22,792
But, no matter how strong

1518
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:26,458
she can't... beat this...

1519
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:27,750
Hah!!

1520
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,375
This is our last resort...

1521
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,500
Both of you, get down!!

1522
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:51,708
Are you okay,

1523
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,792
Ran? Sonoko?

1524
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,333
Good work, young boy!

1525
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,958
It's amazing you made it here.

1526
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:02,083
It's connected to Yorioya Island.

1527
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:06,917
The story about the pirate's treasure
was true after all.

1528
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:09,375
Nope... there seems to have been no treasure,
the men were saying...

1529
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:13,042
They were making a fuss saying that the ones
who cane here before them stole it all.

1530
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:14,458
Oh...

1531
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:17,292
So, that's the story! Too bad!

1532
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:20,708
I think you can come out now.

1533
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,625
You were following me from behind
all the way here, right?!

1534
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:35,708
Inspector!! Isn't the boat leaving already?

1535
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,833
The wind has subsided too...

1536
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,042
Mr. Mouri...

1537
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,042
According to the forecast,

1538
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:43,583
there'll be strong wind and rain
until early tomorrow morning,

1539
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:45,167
B, But take a look.

1540
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:47,500
The weather's really getting nicer.

1541
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,250
Please calm down, Mr. Mouri.

1542
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,583
How the hell do you expect me
to stay calm at a time like this?!

1543
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,500
Ran's been kidnapped you know!!

1544
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,458
But the only one
who went to rescue her is the glasses kid...

1545
01:27:56,458 --> 01:28:01,000
And, all the adults here are just
sitting here sucking our fingers waiting...

1546
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,292
Mr. Mouri...

1547
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,375
I understand how you feel,

1548
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:07,875
but if the boats can't sail,
there's nothing more that we can do...

1549
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,042
As soon as the wind subsides,

1550
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,042
we promise we'll go save the girls...

1551
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,333
Please endure for now!

1552
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,333
Darn!!

1553
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,708
Come on out.

1554
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,625
You followed me in secret all the way here,
didn't you?

1555
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:28,500
Mr. Iwanaga?

1556
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:37,000
Not really in secret. It sounds bad...

1557
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:40,167
I came here wanting to save the two
who were kidnapped...

1558
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:42,500
Why did you bring a rifle with you?

1559
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,292
Well, they were on the
internationally wanted list, weren't they?

1560
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:49,875
Isn't that rifle the one
that was stolen from Mr. Mineo?

1561
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,167
Huh? N, No...

1562
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:53,583
Didn't you bring the rifle along

1563
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,375
to make sure
they wouldn't take the treasure from you?

1564
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,542
T, The treasure has nothing to do with it...

1565
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,125
Mr. Iwanaga...

1566
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:04,417
You said that you thought out the code
that was on the treasure hunt map

1567
01:29:04,417 --> 01:29:06,708
that you handed out to us, right...

1568
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,208
Y, Yeah...

1569
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:11,417
But, I saw the same number codes
at Mr. Mima's house...

1570
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:13,333
On the treasure hunt map

1571
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:16,417
that is said to have been left behind
by Anne Bonny...

1572
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:19,958
300 year ago...

1573
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:26,667
Which means, you must've looked at that map,
Mr. Iwanaga, right?

1574
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:30,792
In other words, you tried to make the people
who came to visit this island,

1575
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:34,542
solve the code
that you yourself couldn't solve.

1576
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,083
Come to think of it,

1577
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:39,917
he was also urging dad
to participate in the game too...

1578
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:43,292
I see, the rate of a famed detective
solving the problem

1579
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:46,000
is much higher than that of the children.

1580
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,458
Besides,
in order to keep track of the people

1581
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,042
who participated in the treasure hunt,

1582
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:53,667
you set a GPS on the bicycles
that were rented out, right?

1583
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:56,458
I, I did that to keep
the participants from danger...

1584
01:29:56,875 --> 01:30:00,625
When the numbers on the treasure hunt map
are switched to alphabets,

1585
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,250
it reads Jolly Roger...

1586
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,250
in other words, the pirate flag...

1587
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,792
Yorioya Island was shaped

1588
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:09,167
like that of a skull in the past,

1589
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:11,583
that's why Anne Bonny
left that hint behind...

1590
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:15,417
I think that even the name Yorioya

1591
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:18,167
is variant pronunciation of Jolly Roger...

1592
01:30:19,292 --> 01:30:22,958
I think that you went as far as to
solve the puzzle till here, Mr. Iwanaga but,

1593
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:25,542
Jolly Roger had another meaning...

1594
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:26,917
What?!

1595
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:33,250
On the real map the pirate flag was drawn,
right?

1596
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:37,125
And the 2nd hint was hidden
in the teeth of the skull...

1597
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,708
It was, Dos Diosas,

1598
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:42,125
the two goddesses...

1599
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,833
C, Conan?

1600
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:48,833
Right, you saw them
when you followed me here, didn't you?

1601
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,583
The little shrine of the two goddesses...

1602
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:55,375
That was the sign to the entrance...

1603
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:57,208
I, I see...

1604
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:59,417
I wonder why
I overlooked something like that...

1605
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,125
Darn... I was mistaken to begin with...

1606
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:09,083
The one who rigged the BC jacket,

1607
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:12,000
and the sniper
who shot the two treasure hunters

1608
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,458
was you, wasn't it, Mr. Iwanaga?

1609
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:16,208
The tracks of the wheels of
your mountain bike were found

1610
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,917
behind Grotto as well as the place

1611
01:31:18,917 --> 01:31:22,208
where the cartridges
of the rifle were found...

1612
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:27,250
Ha, ha... They sure are bloopers that
even a grade school child could point out.

1613
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:29,708
It's not a grade school child
that did this...

1614
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:34,792
It's Pops, Kogoro Mouri.

1615
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:37,625
I'm just telling what he told me.

1616
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,333
Pops was saying

1617
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:42,458
that he smelled gunpowder,
from your body, Mr. Iwanaga.

1618
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:44,875
He said that since it was an old rifle,

1619
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,958
when you fired it, a lot of burnt remains
must've scattered all over the place.

1620
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,583
Oh...

1621
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,917
Just as I thought...

1622
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:55,750
Ha, ha... Just as expected of
the famed detective Kogoro Mouri...

1623
01:31:58,292 --> 01:31:59,583
E, Earthquake?

1624
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,833
It stopped...

1625
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:07,833
This is bad... we'd better get out of here.

1626
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:10,125
Yes... we've got to take them along too...

1627
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:14,667
Yep! Mr. Iwanaga, help us!

1628
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:15,875
O, Okay...

1629
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:23,958
Shoots!!

1630
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:26,375
O, Oh no, the entrance...

1631
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:29,667
It's gas!!

1632
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:31,375
To the boat!

1633
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:32,917
Quick!!

1634
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,667
Darn! At this rate...

1635
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,500
Conan... what now?

1636
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:55,958
Let's put those people in the cabin

1637
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:59,083
and just in case
make them inhale air from the air tank,

1638
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:00,875
so that they don't breathe in the gas...

1639
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:04,042
And, use this for Sonoko and yourself...

1640
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:06,333
Huh? What's this?

1641
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:09,167
Air tanks that Doc made for me.

1642
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,542
What about you, Conan?

1643
01:33:10,542 --> 01:33:12,875
I've got mine too, so don't worry.

1644
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:15,833
Oh...

1645
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:26,875
Darn, what now...

1646
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:28,375
The gas'll get to me soon...

1647
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:30,792
Gas? ...

1648
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:36,125
This gas is probably Methane gas,

1649
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:38,042
so it's probably
concentrated near the ceiling...

1650
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:40,667
If I use that gas...

1651
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:43,833
Something... Isn't there something?

1652
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:46,750
I found it!!

1653
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,792
Ran, Sonoko!

1654
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:51,125
Do you hear me?

1655
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:54,708
The fact that sea water is flowing in

1656
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,958
means that the rocks are not that thick.

1657
01:33:56,958 --> 01:34:00,542
So, if you let the gas explode
and broke the ceiling,

1658
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:01,958
we can all float up together
with this ship...

1659
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:05,667
D, Don't tell me you're thinking of
making it out of here on this ship?!

1660
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:06,750
Is it going to work?

1661
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:08,708
I don't know...

1662
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,833
But, if things go as they are,
we'll all fall victim to the gas

1663
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:14,208
or wait around until we drown...

1664
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,583
If we don't have a chance anyway,
we may as well...

1665
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,125
I think it's worth trying...

1666
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,292
Yep... So, what do we do, Conan?

1667
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:26,833
I'm going to kick up the debris
of that chain right now

1668
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,833
and strike the rock of the ceiling.

1669
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:30,375
If it works out, it should spark fire

1670
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,458
and case the gas to explode,

1671
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:36,375
so Ran and Sonoko, go inside the cabin
and breathe using the air tank.

1672
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,792
I think that when the explosion occurs

1673
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:40,625
the air in the area
will decrease drastically.

1674
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:42,417
What about you, Conan?

1675
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:43,875
I'll be fine!

1676
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:45,750
As soon as I kick up the chain

1677
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,708
I'll dive into the cabin right away,
so don't worry!

1678
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:58,000
Okay...

1679
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:07,667
Inspector...

1680
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,292
Hmm... Get the boat ready!

1681
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:11,792
We're heading to the rescue!!

1682
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:12,833
Yes, sir!!

1683
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,833
All ready, Conan!

1684
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:39,667
Alright!

1685
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,417
O... Oh, no!

1686
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:00,042
Conan...

1687
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:01,833
Conan...

1688
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:04,667
Conan, get a hold of yourself...

1689
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:08,458
Ran...

1690
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,958
Hurry! Hurry!

1691
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,833
Can't you go any faster...

1692
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:40,000
P... Pirate ship...

1693
01:37:56,542 --> 01:37:57,625
Ran!

1694
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,667
Are you all right...!!

1695
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:02,917
I'm fine...!

1696
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:04,042
Saved...

1697
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,208
Whaaa...

1698
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:18,375
Run for it, everybody!!

1699
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:20,250
Look out!!

1700
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,833
Jump into the sea...

1701
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:22,792
Sonoko!!

1702
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:27,083
Hurry.

1703
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:52,667
And... did you find the treasure?

1704
01:38:52,667 --> 01:38:53,708
No.

1705
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:56,375
The only thing we found
was a beat up pirate ship.

1706
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:58,292
I think that was the treasure.

1707
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:02,583
Because I think the map

1708
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:05,083
that Anne Bonny left behind
was not really a treasure map

1709
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:10,417
but a message for Mary
that she left back in prison...

1710
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:12,167
A message?

1711
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:13,750
I'm here!

1712
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,708
I'll be waiting here for you forever...

1713
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,167
Shinichi...

1714
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:19,542
Like so!

1715
01:39:19,542 --> 01:39:20,583
Sonoko...

1716
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:26,583
-You precocious brat!!
-Ouch!!

1717
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:30,083
No, she may be right...

1718
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,875
That ship is probably a ship
that Anne had built,

1719
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:39,042
so that when Mary escaped from prison,
and came back,

1720
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:43,042
they could once again go out
and cross the 7 seas.

1721
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:47,958
But, Mary fell ill while in prison
and died...

1722
01:39:47,958 --> 01:39:49,958
Anne herself died.

1723
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:54,375
while waiting for Mary...

1724
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:57,792
And that ship that was left behind

1725
01:39:57,792 --> 01:40:00,667
waited at the coffin-like cave
at the bottom of the sea

1726
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:05,042
for the day that it would once again
be able to set off into the vast sea.

1727
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:07,042
300 years later today,

1728
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:10,083
the ship goes out on its
first and last journey

1729
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:13,250
delivering you all to the surface.

1730
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,833
And, as if going after its two masters...
disappears from sight...

1731
01:40:19,417 --> 01:40:21,958
I spoke of something that
isn't quite like me to say...

1732
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,375
Please forget about it...

1733
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:30,125
Phooey, well since 300 years
have already gone by,

1734
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:33,125
who knows what the real truth is...

1735
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:37,250
Well, it's sure no mistake
that Anne was waiting for Mary,

1736
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,542
Pops...

1737
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:42,667
As proof of that,
under the skull of Jolly Roger,

1738
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:51,833
a picture is drawn of...
Anne and Mary's pistol and Cutlass...

1739
01:44:49,958 --> 01:44:51,000
Ran...

1740
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:53,542
Uh...

1741
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:59,250
how did you know back then that
I didn't have an air tank?

1742
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:05,208
Because you looked so much like Shinichi...

1743
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:09,375
I think it was when we were in 8th grade...

1744
01:45:09,792 --> 01:45:14,000
It suddenly started to rain really hard
on my way home from school...

1745
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:23,042
Oh, bummers...

1746
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,375
Here, use this...

1747
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,958
You gotta rush home, right?

1748
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:32,375
Oh, yes, thank you...

1749
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,583
What about you, Shinichi?

1750
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,917
Don't be silly, I'm a detective you know.

1751
01:45:36,917 --> 01:45:39,375
I deduced that
something like this could happen

1752
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:43,083
and brought another one with me.

1753
01:45:43,417 --> 01:45:44,583
Wow,

1754
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:47,750
thanks... I have promised to see mother so...

1755
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,375
I'll borrow this then.
I'll give it back to you tomorrow!

1756
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,542
Okay...!

1757
01:45:52,542 --> 01:45:56,375
But, he didn't have
any extra umbrella with him...

1758
01:45:57,583 --> 01:45:59,333
He got home soaking wet

1759
01:45:59,333 --> 01:46:00,833
and caught a clod...

1760
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:05,542
Right... you looked just like him back then,
that's why.

1761
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:08,750
You look so much like
that super idiot deduction freak

1762
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,833
when he grins and bears something!

1763
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:15,500
So sorry...

1764
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,708
I'm an idiot...
