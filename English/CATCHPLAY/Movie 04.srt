1
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:53,195
Hey! Look at this! There's a dinosaur!

2
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,379
Huh?

3
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,414
Urgh. He always runs off suddenly.

4
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,577
Here! You must be thirsty!

5
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,279
Thanks...

6
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,949
Oh, no! It's three minutes 'til!

7
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,600
H-Hold on, Shinichi!

8
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,461
Alright! We made it in time!

9
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,498
What is this place?
It's just an ordinary plaza...

10
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,166
Just watch!

11
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,736
Ten. Nine. Eight.

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,173
Seven. Six. Five.

13
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,910
Four! Three! Two!

14
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:42,923
One!

15
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,160
What?!

16
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:54,189
These fountains go off every two hours.

17
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,958
You like stuff like this, right?

18
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,927
Shinichi!

19
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:03,699
It's your present for winning
the city karate championship!

20
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,200
Accept it gratefully!

21
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,522
Oh, you think you're such a big shot!

22
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,478
A rainbow!

23
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,114
Alright! Let's make a toast!

24
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,127
Okay!

25
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,203
Gah...

26
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,144
You're so funny!

27
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,159
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi!

28
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:08,330
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

29
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,601
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal with a man dressed in black!

30
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,103
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

31
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,255
that I didn't notice a second
man sneak up from behind me!

32
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:26,348
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

33
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,950
...my body had shrunk!

34
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:32,788
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

35
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,290
putting all the people around me in danger!

36
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:38,860
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

37
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:43,298
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

38
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,133
To get information on the men,

39
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:48,251
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

40
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,543
Great Detective Mori! What was
the key to solving this latest case?!

41
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,128
No, uhh, I don't really remember...

42
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,318
That's only natural.

43
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:06,388
'Cause I always put the old guy to
sleep with my stun-gun wristwatch

44
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:12,561
and use my voice-changing bowtie
to solve cases with his voice.

45
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,097
Dr. Agasa invented these two gadgets!

46
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,399
Hi there!

47
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,237
He's always making unique gadgets,
like a Turbo-Engine Skateboard,

48
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:29,258
Tracking Glasses, and
Power-Assisted Kick Shoes!

49
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:37,152
However, neither Ran nor her dad
have realized who I really am.

50
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,454
The only ones who know are Dr. Agasa,

51
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,357
Hattori Heiji, the high
school detective of the west,

52
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:46,261
and my classmate, Haibara Ai.

53
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,864
She originally worked with the men in black,

54
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:55,316
but to escape from them, she took
the same poison I did and shrank!

55
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,208
The Black Organization
still remains a mystery!

56
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:06,364
And now, a large barrier is about
to stand between Ran and me!

57
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,191
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

58
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,479
There is always only one truth!

59
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,510
Fountains?

60
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:39,214
Yeah! It was so pretty with
the rainbow and everything!

61
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,216
Oh, yeah! It was!

62
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,853
Ugh. She remembers the stupidest things...

63
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,722
Say! Let's go to Tropical Land again!

64
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:48,524
Eh?!

65
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:53,328
We've never gone there
together since that day!

66
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:58,066
Of course we haven't!
I've been little ever since that day!

67
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,168
So, when do you wanna go?

68
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,836
No, uhh...

69
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,573
- Do you think Conan-kun's home?
- Good question!

70
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,943
We'll just have to find out!

71
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:14,583
Sorry, Ran! I'm involved in another case!
I'll call you again! Later!

72
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,785
Oh! Wait! Shinichi!

73
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,438
Urgh! It's always "case, case, case"!

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,778
You stupid case freak!

75
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,197
Not even Conan-kun'll figure this one out!

76
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,782
I can't wait to see his "I give up" look!

77
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,204
Conan-kun's "I give up," huh?

78
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,560
I give up! You beat me!

79
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,428
"Victory"

80
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,978
What're you smilin' about?

81
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,045
Conan-kun!

82
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:48,383
Perfect timing! We were just
headed to your place right now!

83
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,487
All three of us thought
up a super special riddle!

84
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,289
Riddle?

85
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,323
Ready?

86
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,994
When asked what she
thinks Conan-kun is like,

87
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,230
Haibara-san looked at the moon
and answered, "He's not summer."

88
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:08,436
Did Haibara-san 1. praise Conan-kun,
or 2. insult Conan-kun?

89
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,338
Which is it?!

90
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:14,943
Not summer... Moon...

91
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,412
Got it! The answer is #2!

92
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,948
- Eh?!
- W-Why is that?!

93
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,318
The months, or "moons," of summer
are June, July, and August.

94
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,988
Together, their numbers spell out,
"There's nothing good about him!"

95
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,791
You really are amazing, Conan-kun!

96
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,360
Bah! You're no fun.

97
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:35,330
Never mind that. Tell me
why you were smiling earlier.

98
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,465
Okay, then will you "I give up" for us?

99
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,649
Huh?

100
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,272
- Let's cross!
- Hold it! No crossing!

101
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,442
A blinking green light is
the same as a yellow light.

102
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,211
Wait until the next green light.

103
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:53,348
Okay...

104
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,683
We got in trouble...

105
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,541
Yeah, but he is right.

106
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,627
Now, I have a question for you!

107
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,463
What do you think that man's job is?

108
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,681
Eh?

109
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,835
A school teacher?

110
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,971
A businessman?
No, he doesn't have a briefcase...

111
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,740
An eel restaurant owner?

112
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,075
The answer is "police detective."

113
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,310
P-Police detective?!

114
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,479
Whenever police detectives
need to make note of something,

115
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,166
they rotate their police
notebooks and write horizontally.

116
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,087
- Really?
- You're so smart, Conan-kun!

117
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,545
You know everything!

118
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,662
Oh! It's green! Let's cross!

119
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,618
Yeah!

120
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,561
That man's been shot! That person did it!

121
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,562
Oh, no, you don't!

122
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:15,951
Conan-kun! Watch out!

123
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,948
- Call an ambulance!
- U-Understood!

124
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,906
Dammit! Got away!

125
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,113
Hang in there, Mister! Who shot you?!

126
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,594
What?!

127
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,331
At approximately 2:00 today,
at the Beika Park intersection,

128
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:27,435
Assistant Police Detective
Narasawa Osamu was shot and killed.

129
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,771
The shooter appears to have fled.

130
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,606
Assistance has been sent
from Police Headquarters,

131
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,610
and a task force has been
set up by the Beika Police.

132
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:41,816
I'm sorry to ask yet again, but
could you tell us about the murderer?

133
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,518
It was a young man!

134
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,221
No, it was a pretty lady!

135
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,790
No! It was a middle-aged man!

136
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,793
How about the person's umbrella?

137
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,194
It was a black umbrella!

138
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,630
It was green! Green!

139
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,532
I think it was blue...

140
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,536
Hey, now. Did you guys really see anything?

141
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,238
What about you, Conan-kun?

142
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,808
The raincoat and umbrella were gray-ish,

143
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,377
but I don't know if it was a man or woman.

144
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,913
But the umbrella was in their right hand!

145
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,483
Meaning they fired
the gun with their left hand.

146
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,719
So the killer is left-handed...

147
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,654
Incidentally, Inspector.

148
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:24,759
Why did Assistant Detective Narasawa
die holding the left side of his chest?

149
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:30,187
We believe it was meant to indicate
the police notebook in his pocket.

150
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:36,525
We're currently looking into
everything written in that notebook.

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,274
Inspector Megure.

152
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:45,446
The cartridges at the scene were
from a 9-mm caliber automatic.

153
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,582
A 9-mm caliber?

154
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,386
That's a common gun
even a woman could handle...

155
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,422
But it's a good thing none of you
got caught in the middle of it!

156
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,690
You too, Conan-kun!

157
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,692
Yeah!

158
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,294
Damn!

159
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,721
If only the light hadn't turned red,
they wouldn't have gotten away!

160
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,868
"Another Detective Murdered!"

161
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,170
"The Work of Extremists?"
"Gangs Enacting Revenge?"

"The Mystery Deepens"
"A Personal Grudge!?"

163
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,622
"Challenge for Police!"

164
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,481
This is Megure.

165
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,983
Oh, Mori-kun?

166
00:12:55,007 --> 00:13:00,088
Inspector, I'd like to know
more about last night's incident...

167
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,809
I'm sorry. I'm busy.
Maybe some other time.

168
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,261
Hello?! Inspector?!

169
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,496
What happened?

170
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,765
Says he's busy.

171
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,036
Of course he is.
They've lost two of their detectives.

172
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,465
Still, he seemed
different from his normal self...

173
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,346
Alright, Shiratori-kun.

174
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,516
Only you and I can
know about the incident.

175
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,474
Do not tell anyone.

176
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,454
Understood.

177
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:38,826
As the ballistic fingerprints of
the bullets used in the murders match,

178
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,810
authorities now believe these
were acts of the same individual.

179
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:49,989
And now for the weather.
A high pressure system will...

180
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:01,082
Still, Shiratori-san's sister
sure knows how to pick a bad time

181
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:01,650
"15 F - Wedding Celebration" Still,
Shiratori-san's sister sure knows how to pick a bad time

182
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,586
"15 F - Wedding Celebration"
to hold a wedding reception...

183
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:05,921
to hold a wedding reception...

184
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,657
It can't be helped. It was
planned a month in advance,

185
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:12,226
and it's not her fault
the incidents happened.

186
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,265
Besides, it's not a wedding reception,
it's a wedding celebration!

187
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,168
The bride and groom's friends
are the ones in charge of it!

188
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,853
Yeah, I know!

189
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:28,109
Hey! What's the groom, Haretsuki-san, like?

190
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,445
Apparently, he's a painter!

191
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,847
Add "struggling" to the beginning of that.

192
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,283
A struggling painter, huh?

193
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,868
I guess I can't expect very
much from his guy friends...

194
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,113
"Mori Kogoro"

195
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,028
I see your handwriting is as blunt as ever...

196
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,296
Mom!

197
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,298
You got invited, too?

198
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:55,160
Yes. Sara-san is an
up-and-coming attorney I work with.

199
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,488
"Kisaki Eri"

200
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,875
Wow! You have such great handwriting!

201
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,446
Geez. Don't sign in separately
if you're husband and wife.

202
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,948
Please store this for me!

203
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,634
Your number is 87!

204
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,322
Come on, Conan-kun!

205
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,506
Yeah!

206
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,066
Wow! Look at all these people!

207
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,991
Oh! The inspector's here!

208
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:32,907
It's so easy to spot members of the police.

209
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,811
They have menacing looks in their eyes,
and are all-around gloomy.

210
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,949
Can't blame 'em. This's no time
for a party, after what's happened.

211
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:45,419
Detective Sato is always cheerful, though!

212
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:47,755
Well? Fine feathers make
fine birds, wouldn't you agree?

213
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,526
N-Not at all! It suits you very well!

214
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,987
Oh! It's Odagiri-san!
I'm gonna go say hello.

215
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,535
- Who?
- Police Superintendent Odagiri.

216
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,372
He was Chief Detective when that
bonehead private eye worked there.

217
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,456
I believe he's head of
criminal investigations now.

218
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:13,848
Thank you all for your patience!
Here are the bride and groom!

219
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,636
Please greet them with
tremendous applause!

220
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,970
Wow! How wonderful!

221
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,026
Kotaro! Sara-san! Congratulations!

222
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,144
Mori-san.

223
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,379
Oh! Congrats!

224
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,315
Thank you.

225
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,817
Oh, let me introduce you.

226
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,819
This is my doctor, Dr. Kazato.

227
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:55,590
He's a psychiatrist at
Beika Yakushino Hospital.

228
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,892
I'm Kazato. It's nice to meet you.

229
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,327
I'm Mori.

230
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,198
This is my wife Eri, my daughter
Ran, and my moocher Conan.

231
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,334
Quit callin' me a moocher.

232
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,737
But Shiratori-san... A psychiatrist?

233
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:14,742
Yes, worries and concerns are always
a part of management positions.

234
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,233
Which is why...

235
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,850
...I think you should have him
take a look at you, Mori-san.

236
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:27,221
Yeah... Lately, my memory's been a bit...

237
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,713
Hey, you! What's that supposed to mean?!

238
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,229
That's enough laughing out of you!

239
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,198
Ouch!

240
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,466
Excuse me!

241
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,234
Inspector!

242
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,403
Oh, Mori-kun.

243
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,438
Have you found anything out since then?

244
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:47,090
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about that.

245
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,946
Why won't he talk to me?

246
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,149
There must be something he can't tell you.

247
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,785
Hey! Is that true, Takagi?!

248
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,420
N-No, not really!

249
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:04,143
Say, Takagi-san. You like
Detective Sato, don't you?

250
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:10,731
How interesting!
I'll go tell her how you feel!

251
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:13,100
H-Hold on! Wait!

252
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,489
Okay!

253
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,072
We're keeping it from the press,

254
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:22,143
but Detective Shiba also died
holding his police notebook...

255
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,911
What?!

256
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,313
Which means...

257
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,917
There is no use in prying
any further, Mori-san.

258
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:34,503
"Need not to know."
That should be clear enough.

259
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:44,498
"Need not to know..."

260
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,149
This can't be!

261
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:50,471
"Need not to know."

262
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,108
A special phrase used
among police detectives...

263
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:59,468
Does this mean the killer is someone
inside the police department?!

264
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,152
And not just anyone...
it's someone high-ranking...

265
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:10,136
Or it could be the entire
police organization itself!

266
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,163
So he didn't say anything special to propose?

267
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:19,233
No, he's not good at that sort of thing.

268
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,570
It's better when men are like that.

269
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:27,361
Anyone who lays the flattery
on so thick is no good.

270
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:37,084
Say! I've been meaning to ask,
but how did Dad propose to you?

271
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,254
It was just a bunch of
over-flattery, like I said.

272
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,157
Sensei! Please tell us!

273
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,526
But I've forgotten.

274
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,596
Oh, you're always playing dumb!

275
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,268
- Please tell us, for future reference!
- C'mon! Quit teasing us, Mom!

276
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,270
Let me think...

277
00:19:56,294 --> 00:20:01,375
"I love you. More than anyone on this Earth."

278
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,798
Or something like that!

279
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,183
No way...

280
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,437
That's so nice!

281
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:19,193
"Oh, if Shinichi were to say that to me..."

282
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,295
Get that look off your face!

283
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,399
L-I don't have a look, Sonoko!

284
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,102
What's wrong, Ran-neechan?

285
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,070
Your face is red!

286
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:32,306
No, it's nothing!

287
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,809
Toshiya! What are you doing here?!

288
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:41,415
This is no place for the likes of you!
You weren't invited to this party!

289
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:45,386
Shut it! I just happened to come
to this hotel 'cause of work!

290
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,592
That's his son, Toshiya-san!
I heard he's in a rock band...

291
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:55,262
Now, now! It's all right, Superintendent!

292
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:58,265
- Toshiya-kun, enjoy yourself.
- Get out!

293
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,835
Quit prowling around like
a stray dog looking for food!

294
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,293
- Say what?!
- Toshiya-san!

295
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,244
Sorry to bother you!

296
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,099
Toshiya-kun!

297
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,269
Huh? Where have I seen her before?

298
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,485
Sato-kun.

299
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,205
About you-know-what...

300
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,875
- No, I'm fine!
- But...

301
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,959
- There's no need to worry!
- Hey, now!

302
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,403
- #38, please.
- Right!

303
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:19,146
- Oh! Ran-chan!
- Detective Sato!

304
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,750
Such a weird party, isn't it?
With all those police...

305
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,654
Not really. But please be careful, okay?

306
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,855
Eh?

307
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,325
Police detectives are being
shot one after the other...

308
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,409
I'll be fine! I'm tough!

309
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,939
Huh?

310
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,740
A blackout?

311
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:49,944
- What do you suppose happened?
- That's strange.

312
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,368
I'll go look around. Stay here.

313
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,412
Detective Sato! There's a flashlight here!

314
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:03,812
See?

315
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,046
No, Ran-san!

316
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,546
Detective Sato!

317
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,924
Detective Sato...

318
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,508
Detective Sato! Say something!

319
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:52,185
It's... It's because
I picked up the flashlight...

320
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,284
- Ran!
- Sato-san!

321
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,453
Hey! Ran! Are you alright?!

322
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:10,174
Ran-neechan is only unconscious!
The injured one is...

323
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:14,640
Sato-san! Sato-san! Please say something!

324
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:16,764
W-What on earth?!

325
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:21,802
Megure! Call an ambulance! Shiratori!
Seal all of the hotel's exits!

326
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:22,803
Yes, sir!

327
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:26,173
Hello?! I'm on the 15th floor
of the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel!

328
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,543
A woman has been shot!
Please send an ambulance immediately!

329
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,545
It's out of bullets...

330
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:36,617
A 9-mm caliber automatic!
It's the same person!

331
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,872
But... why is there a flashlight?

332
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,123
Hurry!

333
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,876
Seal off all exits!

334
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,345
Test everyone but the children
for traces of gunpowder!

335
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:08,849
No exceptions! That includes
me and every officer here!

336
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,865
And this fool too, of course!

337
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,426
That guy's still here?

338
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,546
But I don't see those two...

339
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,289
"In Surgery"

340
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,681
Inspector Megure.
What is Sato-san's condition?

341
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,617
One of the bullets stopped
right next to her heart.

342
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:47,721
They say she only has a 50-50
chance of pulling through...

343
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:50,557
Inspector, what about Ran?

344
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:55,129
Luckily, she suffered no external injuries,
but she's still unconscious.

345
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,587
She's in the room at the far end.

346
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,537
Ran is probably all right.

347
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,395
But I'm curious about that flashlight...

348
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,444
Could it have been...

349
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,646
Shiratori-kun, how is the investigation going?

350
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,583
We checked everyone for traces
of gunpowder, but we found nothing.

351
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:18,552
Nothing?!

352
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:23,757
We believe the shooter fled the
building before the exits were sealed.

353
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:27,494
- Any fingerprints on the gun?!
- Nothing there, either.

354
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,498
Chiba-kun, did you figure out
how the switchboard was rigged?

355
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:37,070
Yes. It appears it was set to
explode via a cell phone call.

356
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:40,174
There's something that has me curious.

357
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:45,612
The flashlight on the bathroom floor...
Did it belong to Sato-san?

358
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:48,115
I don't think so!

359
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,485
The cabinet doors under the vanity were open.

360
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,255
It was probably left in there...
with its light on.

361
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,825
What?! Then the shooter...

362
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:03,297
I see! Nobody would've noticed
it when the lights were on!

363
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:08,802
There's almost no question this is
related to "the" incident, then.

364
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,704
What's "the" incident?!

365
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,005
No, uhh...

366
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:18,045
Why won't you tell me?!
One misstep and Ran could've been shot!

367
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,613
Inspector!

368
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,182
- I have terrible news! It's Ran!
- What about her?!

369
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:25,719
She's conscious again,
but she's acting strange!

370
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,074
What?!

371
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,051
Ran-neechan!

372
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,487
Are you all right, Ran-neechan?

373
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:47,060
Who are you... little boy?

374
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,384
W-Whoa, now...

375
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:03,991
She can't even remember
her own name, much less us...

376
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,495
That can't be!
I'm Mori Kogoro, your father!

377
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,511
She's Kisaki Eri, your mother!

378
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:17,024
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

379
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:21,394
Ran...

380
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,688
Dr. Kazato, I'm sorry to bother you like this,

381
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,704
but there weren't any
psychiatrists on duty, so...

382
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,445
Do you know who you are?

383
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:52,205
Then, do you remember
what happened today?

384
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:53,440
No.

385
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:55,709
What's the capital of the United States?

386
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,577
Washington, D.C.

387
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,413
What's 5 times 8?

388
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,914
40.

389
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,736
Please click this ballpoint pen.

390
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:14,762
"Conference Room 4"

391
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,363
"Conference Room 4"
Retrograde amnesia?

392
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:16,664
Retrograde amnesia?

393
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,667
Yes. It's a type of memory disorder
in which sudden illness or injury

394
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:25,472
leaves the sufferer unable to remember
anything prior to the infliction.

395
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:30,911
In your daughter's case, I believe
she received a strong mental shock

396
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,781
after witnessing Detective Sato
being shot before her very eyes.

397
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:38,251
So, will my daughter's memory return?!

398
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:41,088
I can't say anything at this point in time.

399
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:47,027
But I found no problems with her
knowledge about everyday life.

400
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,630
So she can live a normal life, then?!

401
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:57,504
Yes. But let's keep her here for
observation for a few more days.

402
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:00,507
It's only natural that
Ran would be shocked

403
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:04,978
if a detective she knew was
shot right in front of her...

404
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:10,984
But there had to be more to it than
that for her to lose her memory!

405
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:15,843
Something that would
pierce her mind even more!

406
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,804
They've finished operating on Sato-san.

407
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,407
They managed to remove the bullet,

408
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,229
but it's hard to say
if she'll survive or not...

409
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,546
I see...

410
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,872
Inspector! You still won't say
anything, even after all this?!

411
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:50,590
Shiratori! You know, too! Tell me!

412
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:54,227
We will arrest the person
responsible ourselves.

413
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,196
Damn it!

414
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,265
Say, Detective Chiba.

415
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,835
Did you check for fingerprints
on the flashlight in the bathroom?

416
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:07,874
Yeah. But we only found Ran-san's fingerprints.

417
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:12,879
We all assumed it was Sato-san
who had the flashlight,

418
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:15,449
but it appears it was actually Ran-san.

419
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:20,954
In which case, Ran would've felt
it was her fault Sato-san was shot.

420
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:26,473
And it's because of that shock
that she lost her memory?!

421
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:28,880
Ran...

422
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:41,475
Even if your memory
never comes back, I'll always...

423
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,592
...be your friend...

424
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,932
I'll tell you everything.

425
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,225
But, Inspector Megure! That's...

426
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:03,983
It's okay. If I get fired, I'll just
open a detective agency like Mori-kun.

427
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,901
Inspector...

428
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,303
Takagi-kun, watch Sato-kun.

429
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,305
Chiba-kun, you watch Ran-kun.

430
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,941
If anything happens, report immediately.

431
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:15,989
Yes, sir!

432
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,850
Last summer, the body of Jinno Tamotsu,

433
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:28,455
a doctor at Toto University
Hospital's 1st Dept. Of Surgery,

434
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,191
was found in his apartment.

435
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,529
The investigation was headed
by Inspector Tomonari,

436
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,099
my superior in Investigation Section 1.

437
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,670
Under him were Narasawa and Shiba,
who've been shot and killed.

438
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:46,673
Sato-kun was also working with them.

439
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:52,345
Mr. Jinno drank a lot of alcohol
and then cut his right jugular vein

440
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,849
with his own scalpel.

441
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,684
He died of blood loss.

442
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,687
The first person to find him
was his sister Tamaki-san,

443
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:04,357
an investigative reporter
who lives in a neighboring town.

444
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:06,359
Old man! She's...

445
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,395
She was at the hotel party!

446
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,999
Now I remember!
She came to see me once before!

447
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:15,001
Eh? She went to your office?

448
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:18,505
What did she tell you then?

449
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,075
Actually, I was quite intoxicated at the time,

450
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:28,348
so I can't remember what
she talked to me about at all...

451
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:31,985
I remember the incident
with this Jinno person!

452
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,988
Didn't the family of a patient
sue him for botching an operation

453
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,691
a few days before he died?

454
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,392
That's right.

455
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:44,397
He left a final message on his
word processor, apologizing for it,

456
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:49,202
so Inspector Tomonari concluded
it was most likely a suicide.

457
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:54,407
But his sister, Tamaki-san, disagreed.

458
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:59,846
She said he was a terrible doctor
who never cared about his patients,

459
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,751
and that he'd never kill himself
to apologize for a botched operation.

460
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:09,756
And a week before,
she apparently saw him arguing

461
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,594
with a purple-haired young
man in front of a warehouse.

462
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:17,030
Purple hair?!

463
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:21,968
Just to be sure, Inspector Tomonari
took Sato, Narasawa, and Shiba

464
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:23,960
to the warehouse.

465
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:30,631
It was a particularly hot day,
with temperatures topping 35°C [95°F].

466
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,449
It's locked!

467
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:37,817
Alright! Let's stake it out!

468
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:40,071
- You're over there, Shiba-kun!
- Yes, sir!

469
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,652
I can't believe this heat...

470
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,901
What's wrong, Inspector?!

471
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:58,071
He's having a heart attack! Call an ambulance!

472
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,084
Right!

473
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,009
- Don't!
- Eh?!

474
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:06,479
- We're in the middle of a stakeout!
- But...

475
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:07,914
I'll be fine!

476
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:10,950
I'll take a cab to the hospital!

477
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:14,034
Keep... watching the place!

478
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:22,145
But before long, Sato-kun
grew worried and went to look...

479
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,713
Inspector Tomonari!

480
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:38,311
Sato-kun took Inspector Tomonari
straight to Toto University Hospital.

481
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:43,967
However, he died during surgery...

482
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,389
- Sato-san's been gone a long time...
- Yeah...

483
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,539
Here he comes!

484
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:58,180
Damn, it's hot today!

485
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,800
- Let's go!
- Wait!

486
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:03,336
Do you know who that man is?!

487
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,884
Huh?

488
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,094
He's Superintendent Odagiri's son, Toshiya-san!

489
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:17,717
In the end, with Inspector
Tomonari's sudden death,

490
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:23,423
Jinno Tamotsu's death was deemed
a suicide, and the case closed.

491
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,026
His sister Tamaki-san
checked the guy out,

492
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,164
but Detective Shiba told her
he was unrelated to the case.

493
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,900
So that's what happened?

494
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:39,272
Incidentally, Inspector Tomonari
had a son named Makoto...

495
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,076
Oh! He was at the party!

496
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,778
He disappeared soon after, though...

497
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,613
Does he have something to do with this?

498
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,765
Yeah. It happened at the wake.

499
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:56,723
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

500
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,593
My father might still be alive if you had!

501
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,730
No, we only did what he said...

502
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:09,386
You're the ones who killed my father!
I'll never forgive you for this!

503
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,242
- Here you go, Conan-kun.
- Thanks.

504
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:19,245
Shortly after, both Detective
Narasawa and Detective Shiba

505
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:21,247
were transferred to
the district police station.

506
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:26,219
But Shiratori-kun noticed that
Sato-kun had started investigating

507
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,822
something on her own just recently.

508
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:33,560
She, Detective Narasawa, and Detective Shiba

509
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,280
started to re-investigate
that case from one year ago.

510
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:49,242
But it seems Sato-san wasn't
informed about the relationship

511
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,811
between Toshiya-kun and Jinno.

512
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:58,184
Detective Narasawa was
shot and killed shortly after.

513
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:01,254
Then, after Detective Shiba was killed too,

514
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:07,427
we realized they were targeted
because of the case one year ago.

515
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,195
From the police notebooks,

516
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,365
we deduced the killer was
connected to the police somehow.

517
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:16,803
Detective Takagi investigated the
inspector's son, Tomonari Makoto,

518
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:21,730
and I investigated the
superintendent's son, Toshiya-kun.

519
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:31,484
I felt there was a good chance
Sato-kun would be targeted next,

520
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:35,722
so I told her to have someone guard her...

521
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,825
...but she declined.

522
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:44,030
So that's why you talked
to her at the party, too?

523
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:45,749
Yes.

524
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:52,739
I've figured it out, Inspector!
The killer is Odagiri Toshiya!

525
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,743
Detectives Narasawa, Shiba, and
Sato had started to re-investigate

526
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,680
Jinno's case from last year,
so he decided to strike first!

527
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:04,484
But he wasn't the one who shot Sato-kun.

528
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,487
We found no traces of gunpowder on him.

529
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,489
Oh. I see.

530
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:14,060
More important is Tomonari Makoto.
We're unable to locate him.

531
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:19,332
Plus, he was seen nearby when
Narasawa and Shiba were shot.

532
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:23,536
And, given that he was at today's party...

533
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,441
We do know the killer
is left-handed, though...

534
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:32,278
C-Come to think of it,
Tomonari Makoto is left-handed, too!

535
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:34,914
Alright! Put Tomonari Makoto
on the wanted list!

536
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:36,200
Yes, sir!

537
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:43,957
Say, Inspector. How was this
Jinno person's jugular vein cut?

538
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:49,529
How? He was cut on the right side,
straight from top to bottom.

539
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:55,301
Then, if it was a murder,
his killer might've been left-handed.

540
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:58,371
- Eh?
- And how do you know that?!

541
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,541
- After all...
- To avoid being covered in blood.

542
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,377
To do that...

543
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:08,281
...you'd have to cut the right
jugular vein with your left hand.

544
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,216
Right, Conan-kun?

545
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,884
Y-Yeah.

546
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:13,219
I see!

547
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:17,457
No, but there's no connection
between Tomonari Makoto and Jinno.

548
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:22,595
If Jinno was murdered, it must've
been a different left-handed killer.

549
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,899
Toshiya-san is left-handed, too.
He lit a match with his left hand.

550
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:31,437
There's another. His father,
Superintendent Odagiri.

551
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:33,573
He's left-handed, too.

552
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:38,645
Don't be stupid! He couldn't
possibly be the killer!

553
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,830
L-Inspector?

554
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,647
"Beika Yakushino Hospital"

555
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,553
I'm Yoshida Ayumi!

556
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:25,491
Kojima Genta-kun, Tsuburaya
Mitsuhiko-kun, and Haibara Ai-san!

557
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,493
We're all Conan-kun's friends,

558
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,563
and we came because we're worried about you.

559
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:35,668
Thank you. But, I'm sorry.
I don't remember any of you.

560
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,204
No! I can't believe this!

561
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,907
You always played with us!

562
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,411
Do you not remember me, either?
I'm Agasa Hiroshi.

563
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:49,415
You know, the brilliant
scientist who lives next door

564
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:53,519
to your childhood friend
and classmate, Kudo Shinichi-kun!

565
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:57,590
Kudo... Shinichi?

566
00:41:57,614 --> 00:42:00,259
You remember Shinichi-niichan?!

567
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:02,547
No... I don't.

568
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:05,719
Oh.

569
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,675
What is it, Haibara?

570
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,362
It felt like someone was
staring at us just now...

571
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,633
Must be my imagination.

572
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,696
I'm sorry. I'm a little tired.

573
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,746
That's okay. Get some rest.

574
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,618
Who's there?!

575
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:49,943
Damn!

576
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,944
What is it, Conan?

577
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:55,548
Old man! Do you think Ran-neechan
could've seen the killer's face

578
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,884
when Detective Sato was shot?!

579
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,885
What?!

580
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,642
If so, then the killer
might try to go after her!

581
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:10,062
I've been waiting for you.

582
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:14,934
Rest easy. Takagi-kun and Chiba-kun
will take turns guarding her.

583
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,636
Where is she now?

584
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,572
- My husband's with her.
- Alright. Let's go.

585
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:22,108
- Um, Kisaki-san?
- Yes?

586
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:26,779
Dr. Kazato says he'd like to
talk to you about your daughter.

587
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:31,001
Her MRI scan shows
no damage to the brain.

588
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:35,588
It appears your
daughter's amnesia occurred

589
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:39,625
as a way to save herself
from mental trauma.

590
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:44,664
Meaning if we take her to that
hotel and recreate the incident,

591
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,599
she'll regain her memory?

592
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,434
What are you talking about?!

593
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,772
There's no need to make her recall
something she doesn't want to!

594
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,642
Are you saying you don't care if
she never gets her memory back?!

595
00:43:56,666 --> 00:44:00,146
I'm against anything
that makes her suffer!

596
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:06,652
Now, now. Forcing her to remember
something could harm her brain.

597
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,041
See?

598
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,740
Pardon me.

599
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,840
This is Kazato.

600
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,799
Okay. Understood. I'll give him a call.

601
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,703
If Ran did see the killer's face,
she's in danger

602
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:28,741
unless we restore her memory
and catch the person ASAP!

603
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:34,013
But just like the doctor says,
we can't force her to remember...

604
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:38,217
I'll just have to protect Ran myself!

605
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:41,687
Huh? He won't answer.

606
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:43,389
Sorry about that.

607
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:49,762
Doctor, is there any way to
restore her memory naturally?

608
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:55,268
It's common for people to suddenly
remember things while relaxed.

609
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,869
Understood.

610
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:59,672
Once Ran checks out,
I'm living in your office too.

611
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,940
What?!

612
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:05,678
I can take care of her that way,
and help her relax.

613
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,215
This isn't a joke!
You'll only stress me out more!

614
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,719
I don't care what happens to you!
This is all for Ran's sake!

615
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:14,710
Got that?!

616
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,237
This won't be good...

617
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:29,402
Ran-san, please don't push yourself
too hard to remember anything.

618
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,703
Okay?

619
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,705
Yes.

620
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,741
Please contact me if any
of her memory returns.

621
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,562
Understood.

622
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,318
You've lived in this town 17 years,
since you were born.

623
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,139
Recognize it?

624
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:59,999
This is your home.

625
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,925
"Mori Detective Agency..."

626
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,990
You'll get wet.

627
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,760
What's wrong, Ran?

628
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:18,284
She must not like puddles.

629
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,267
There was a lot of water when
Detective Sato was shot, too, so...

630
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,658
Pull up a little.

631
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,876
Right.

632
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,965
The second floor is the office.

633
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:36,481
I'm always solving difficult
cases at that desk there!

634
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,991
All you do there is drink beer and watch TV.

635
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:48,180
Here on the third floor is
the living room and the kitchen.

636
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:50,729
And over here is your room.

637
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:11,404
His name's Kudo Shinichi.

638
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,408
He's a real jerk who's trying to seduce you!

639
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,162
I'm not tryin' to seduce anyone!

640
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,848
Oh! You practice karate, Ran-neechan!

641
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:25,351
I know karate?

642
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:30,656
You won the city high school
championship! You don't remember?

643
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,525
No.

644
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,948
Oh.

645
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:39,932
But don't worry! I'll remember
everything sooner or later!

646
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:43,235
Yeah! Let's have something
good to eat tonight

647
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:44,937
to celebrate Ran getting out of the hospital!

648
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:48,795
In that case, maybe I'll cook
something up for old times' sake!

649
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:54,046
Oh? What's with you two?

650
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,216
W-W-What do you mean?
Y-Y-Your cooking...

651
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,954
I don't need any, then! I'm not hungry...

652
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:04,957
You don't need to hold back
to be polite, Conan-kun.

653
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:12,531
I'll work hard to make some scrumptious,
yummy beef stew for you!

654
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:13,866
That's the worst of all...

655
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,869
Huh? Where are you going, dear?

656
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,474
No, uhh, I completely forgot
that I promised to play Mahjong

657
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,609
with the neighbors tonight!

658
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:28,781
This is no time for Mahjong,
when your daughter is like this!

659
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:33,640
Or, what? Are you saying
you can't eat my cooking?

660
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:48,901
Whew! Ran's more cheerful than I thought!

661
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,517
She'll definitely be okay!

662
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,155
Ran...

663
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,015
Bodyguards? Mine?

664
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,806
We heard from Detective Takagi
that the killer might come after you!

665
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,293
We, the Junior Detective League,
have decided to protect you!

666
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,716
We call ourselves...

667
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:53,380
...the Ran-neechan Protection Squad!

668
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,068
Oh, geez...

669
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:59,572
I brought a squirt gun filled with hot sauce!

670
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,507
I brought a boomerang!

671
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,375
And I got handcuffs!

672
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:07,146
C'mon, now. Those kids' toys won't help...

673
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,867
Thanks, guys! I feel much safer!

674
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:17,022
As thanks, I'll treat you to
something nice and cold! Come on up!

675
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:19,525
Okay!

676
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,094
Hurray!

677
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:24,530
She still can't remember anything?

678
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,198
Nope.

679
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:31,036
Wouldn't it be better for you
if her memory never comes back?

680
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,005
Eh?

681
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:36,775
There'd be no need to worry about
her learning who you really are.

682
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,612
W-What did you say?!

683
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:46,118
If I could, I'd want
to lose my memory, too!

684
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:48,621
My sister's murder,

685
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,891
me joining the organization
and creating the poison...

686
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:56,629
How nice it would be to forget
everything and become Haibara Ai,

687
00:50:56,653 --> 00:51:00,132
just an ordinary grade-schooler...

688
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:01,282
And then...

689
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:05,051
you and I...

690
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:10,643
...could always stay together...

691
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:14,580
Haibara... Are you...

692
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,971
Gotcha! Feeling any better?

693
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,788
Hi, Squirt!

694
00:51:22,812 --> 00:51:24,790
Your new girlfriend?

695
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:27,282
And another annoying one shows up...

696
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:35,067
See! These are from when you
won the city karate championship!

697
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,468
Do you remember?

698
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:38,187
No.

699
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:42,174
He's...

700
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:45,177
Oh, Kudo-kun! He's your beau!

701
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,635
I'm not her beau!

702
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:52,017
She seems to recognize him.

703
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,253
Really, Ran-neechan?!

704
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,322
No.

705
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,157
- But...
- But?!

706
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:02,594
...I feel very nostalgic for some reason.

707
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:05,109
I don't know why, though.

708
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,836
Hey! Won't she remember
if she sees Shinichi-san?

709
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,838
Yeah! Bring him here!

710
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:16,175
I would if I could!

711
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,511
Say, he's the high school
detective who solves tough cases

712
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:21,347
all around the country, right?

713
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:26,832
I can't believe him! Where in the
world is he, while Ran's like this?!

714
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,409
Yes?

715
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,078
Ran-neechan, the bath's empty now.

716
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,146
Thanks.

717
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,350
Tell me, Conan-kun.
What's Kudo Shinichi like?

718
00:52:58,374 --> 00:53:00,519
What's he like?

719
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,090
I think he probably thinks about you the most,

720
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:09,517
but can't just come out and say how he feels.

721
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:15,380
I think I'd like to meet him...

722
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:20,105
Hey, Ran. Want to go Ginza tomorrow?

723
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:21,173
Eh?

724
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,743
I get so annoyed when I'm around that man!

725
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:27,713
So let's go on a shopping spree to feel better!

726
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,915
You too, Conan-kun!

727
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:31,372
Yeah!

728
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,137
Are you all right?

729
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:56,208
Sato-san! Sato-san! Please say something!

730
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,943
Thank you!

731
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,945
Uhh...

732
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,834
Damn it!

733
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,263
Here it comes.

734
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,339
Ran!

735
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,746
Ran!

736
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,199
"Beika Yakushino Hospital"

737
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,921
- Ran!
- Shh! He just gave her a sedative.

738
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,790
Is Ran alright?!

739
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,593
Only a few scratches, thankfully.

740
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:55,000
But I'm concerned this may make
her afraid of regaining her memory.

741
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:58,036
Takagi! What were you watching?!

742
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,204
I'm sorry!

743
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:02,274
But now we know for sure.

744
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:09,114
When Sato-kun was shot,
Ran-kun did see the shooter's face.

745
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:12,484
Listen! No matter what happens,
we must keep Ran-kun safe!

746
00:55:12,508 --> 00:55:13,286
Yes, sir!

747
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,712
Keeping her safe isn't enough.
We have to go on the offensive!

748
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:32,804
After it happened, no one tested
positive for traces of gunpowder.

749
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:37,891
Is it really impossible to fire
a gun and leave no gunpowder traces?

750
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:40,767
Wait a minute!

751
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:45,417
If I remember right...

752
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:48,887
...that umbrella was buttoned up!

753
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:51,323
And after the incident...

754
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:55,394
...it was not only unbuttoned,
but in a different location, too!

755
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,012
And then, after Ran left the hospital...

756
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,237
Could it be?!

757
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,073
Eh? That was your umbrella, little boy?

758
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:10,175
Do you know where it is now?

759
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,845
I'm sorry. There was a hole
in it, so I threw it away.

760
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,347
Eh?!

761
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:19,518
I should've figured, after all this time...

762
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:24,356
No, I'm just kidding! I saved it!

763
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,124
Oh, geez...

764
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:27,581
Thanks!

765
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:35,133
Just as I thought!

766
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:40,254
I found the way to fire a gun
without leaving gunpowder traces!

767
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:46,044
It's not just Tomonari Makoto-san
and Jinno Tamaki-san now!

768
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:51,404
This makes even Toshiya-san,
and everyone at the party, a suspect!

769
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,745
This is it!

770
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,524
Now I see!

771
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:38,509
Tamaki-san was at the party
because she was tailing Toshiya!

772
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:47,053
Dammit! Why're you following
me around day after day?!

773
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:50,642
Does it bother you?

774
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,843
What?!

775
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:54,846
I'm going to find the proof
that you murdered him

776
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,862
in place of the two
police detectives you killed!

777
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,324
Trying to entrap him?

778
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:22,207
You're Jinno Tamotsu-san's sister,
Tamaki-san, right?

779
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:27,679
You found out he was the guy
arguing with your brother a year ago,

780
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:30,382
and that he didn't get interrogated

781
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,569
because his father's the
police superintendent, right?

782
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,322
Who are you, little boy?

783
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,525
Edogawa Conan. A detective.

784
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,494
Detective?

785
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:45,831
If you really did love your brother,

786
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,502
you might've held a grudge
against the three police detectives

787
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:54,439
who called your brother's
death a suicide and moved on.

788
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:56,875
I hated my brother!

789
00:58:56,899 --> 00:59:01,613
I'm only investigating what
happened to know the truth!

790
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:06,518
Then let's take a risk and
raid the enemy's home base!

791
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,134
Eh?

792
00:59:18,754 --> 00:59:21,587
He's trying out his sword
with an iai technique!

793
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,254
Whoa!

794
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:36,314
Jinno Tamaki-san, yes?

795
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:39,918
I have something for you.

796
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,553
For me?

797
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:46,241
I found it a month ago,
in my son Toshiya's room.

798
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:50,061
T. Jinno...

799
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,396
This is my brother's?

800
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,664
Yes.

801
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:57,669
I remembered the name, as it was
from Inspector Tomonari's last case

802
00:59:57,693 --> 01:00:02,174
before he suddenly died
of a heart attack a year ago.

803
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,476
When I pressed Toshiya about it,

804
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,280
he confessed he learned Tamotsu-san
was selling drugs on the side,

805
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:12,584
and blackmailed him for it and money.

806
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:18,623
However, Toshiya wasn't in any
of the investigation documents.

807
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:23,662
So I ordered Detective Narasawa
to re-investigate the case.

808
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:29,634
Eh?! You, yourself,
ordered the re-investigation?!

809
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:34,873
After Detective Narasawa was killed,
Inspector Megure took over.

810
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:39,644
But if Detective Narasawa had
started re-investigating on his own,

811
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:44,230
you might've tried to keep
your son out of the picture, right?

812
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:54,125
Indeed, I also have a motive
for murdering all three.

813
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:57,662
Say, if you're serious
about uncovering the truth,

814
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:59,664
let me see the investigation documents!

815
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:01,833
I can't do that!

816
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:06,988
Uncovering the truth is
the job of us, the police!

817
01:01:09,164 --> 01:01:11,576
But it's a real relief
that you weren't hurt!

818
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,060
Thank you. The doctor says I can leave now.

819
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:19,150
Say, Sonoko-san.

820
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:22,254
Quit that! Just "Sonoko" is fine!

821
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,823
What kind of boy is Conan-kun?

822
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,824
Eh?

823
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,728
He risked his life to save mine...

824
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:37,202
Yeah. He's strange.
He's real quick-witted for a kid.

825
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:41,907
Though if you ask me,
he's just an ordinary little brat!

826
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,762
I see.

827
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:50,248
Tropical Land's newly added
"Island of Wild and Ancient Times"

828
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:52,851
will undoubtedly thrill patrons!

829
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,187
I know that place...

830
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:59,224
Tropical Land?

831
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:03,742
Yeah! You and Shinichi-kun
went there together!

832
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,132
"Psychiatric Examination Room"

833
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,565
"Psychiatric Examination Room"
I see.

834
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:08,301
I see.

835
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,269
Your memory's very close to returning.

836
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:18,143
Doctor, if she actually visits
Tropical Land, will her memory return?

837
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,378
Yes, it is possible.

838
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:23,715
- I'll go there tomorrow.
- Eh?

839
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:29,087
Wait! I'm against this!
The killer might go after you again,

840
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:32,924
and it'll hurt you if
you remember the incident!

841
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:37,762
To be honest, I'm afraid of
remembering the incident myself.

842
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:40,765
But I can't stay like this.

843
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:44,769
I need to take that first step forward.

844
01:02:44,793 --> 01:02:46,171
Ran...

845
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,574
You certainly are courageous, Ran-san!

846
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:54,346
With your outlook, you should
be fine if you visit Tropical Land!

847
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,649
Then could you at least wait
until the day after tomorrow?

848
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,351
I have work tomorrow. I can't...

849
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,853
Quit worrying! I'll go with her!

850
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:05,957
I'll put my life on the line to protect Ran!

851
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:08,460
Dear...

852
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,495
Ran! I'm coming, too!

853
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:11,863
Thanks!

854
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:15,300
But keep it a secret from Conan-kun.

855
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,968
Eh?

856
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:20,605
I think he'll come for sure if we tell him.

857
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:25,293
And I don't want to put
him in any more danger.

858
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,531
Alright.

859
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,987
- It got late so fast!
- Yeah.

860
01:03:36,011 --> 01:03:37,188
Conan-kun.

861
01:03:37,212 --> 01:03:40,792
If you wanna see the investigation
documents, I have copies.

862
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:41,826
Really?!

863
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,195
I am an investigative reporter!

864
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,731
They're in my apartment,
so I'll show 'em to you tomorrow.

865
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:48,052
Okay!

866
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,254
I'll be back later!

867
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:02,414
There he goes! Little does he know!

868
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,998
Okay! Let's head out, too!

869
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,725
Yes! Ran-oneesan is leaving!

870
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,861
Keeping watch all morning was worth it!

871
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:19,364
Do you suppose Edogawa-kun wasn't informed?

872
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:23,034
That's fine by me!
He's always beating us to the punch!

873
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:26,858
Listen, now! Nothing dangerous!

874
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:40,032
Follow the car in front of us!

875
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:52,397
Well? Figure anything out, Detective?

876
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,400
This notebook Detective Shiba is holding...

877
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,469
What about it?

878
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,871
If he pulled it from his breast pocket,

879
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:03,908
wouldn't his notebook
be turned the other way?

880
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:07,912
It's like so, and when you pull it
out of the pocket... You're right!

881
01:05:07,936 --> 01:05:13,651
It's possible the killer pulled
the notebook out, not Detective Shiba!

882
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:18,840
Eh?! L-I see. That is possible.

883
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:22,260
Huh?

884
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:23,895
I'll find it!

885
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:27,298
I thought you were right-handed, Tamaki-san?

886
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:32,937
Eh? Oh, I was originally left-handed,
but switched to right-handed.

887
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:36,074
So when I'm thinking or smoking or whatever,

888
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,310
I sometimes use my left
hand without realizing it!

889
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:41,613
Without realizing it?

890
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:44,037
Come to think of it, back then...

891
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,266
Wait a minute! Does that mean...

892
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,337
Could it be?!

893
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:56,977
Is that what it meant?!

894
01:05:57,986 --> 01:06:02,033
Say! Your brother worked at
Toto University Hospital, right?

895
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:07,005
Yeah, but I'm sorry, Conan-kun.
I have somewhere I have to go.

896
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,020
- That's all for today.
- Eh?

897
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,516
Bye, Conan-kun!

898
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,717
Tropical Land.

899
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:21,072
You got it!

900
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,641
I remember this place...

901
01:06:43,665 --> 01:06:46,978
As I recall, when Shinichi
came here with you,

902
01:06:47,002 --> 01:06:50,548
he solved a murder that
happened on a roller coaster.

903
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,251
Then let's ride it!

904
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,720
You might remember some more stuff!

905
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:56,988
Let's see...

906
01:06:57,012 --> 01:07:02,746
The Mystery Coaster is on the
Island of Mystery and Fantasy.

907
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,281
You two take the front seat.

908
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:19,544
So you see? Conan Doyle
must've wanted to say this!

909
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:20,557
Huh?

910
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:24,062
No, nothing!

911
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,059
Oh! There's Ran-oneesan and the others!

912
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:37,095
Bah! I wanna ride it...

913
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,130
What are you talking about?!

914
01:07:39,154 --> 01:07:43,635
We need to use this time to look
around for anyone suspicious!

915
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,889
- Let's go!
- Alright!

916
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:52,377
Say, wasn't Mori-kun afraid of heights?

917
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:56,667
Oh, no! T-Time out!

918
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,996
Um, are you all right?

919
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,420
- Ran! Want a cola?
- Sure!

920
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,304
Yay! Troppy balloons!

921
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:23,287
Urgh! Who made that stupid thing, anyway?!

922
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,164
Here! You must be thirsty!

923
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:35,186
Here's your cola!

924
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,201
T-Thanks!

925
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:44,462
You're Kudo Shinichi?

926
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:49,617
But... I still can't remember who you are.

927
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,342
Um, Mori-san...

928
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,358
- I need to use the restroom.
- Yeah.

929
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:06,403
Yay! Thank you!

930
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:12,069
The balloons are flying away!

931
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,559
Ran-san! Look out!

932
01:09:29,564 --> 01:09:30,875
Stop!

933
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:32,992
Wait, children! Stop!

934
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,081
I won't let you escape!

935
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:38,094
Oops!

936
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:45,174
Eat this! Hot Sauce Squirt Gun!

937
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,103
You're Tomonari Makoto!

938
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:00,705
What is that?!

939
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,173
A knife!

940
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:03,941
That's...

941
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:08,546
Tomonari Makoto! You're under
arrest for attempted murder!

942
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:11,215
We did it!

943
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:17,188
- "The Ran-neechan Protection Squad..."
...is victorious!

944
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:20,458
M-Mori-san! I'm going to take
him directly to headquarters now!

945
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,950
Wait. I'm coming with you.

946
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,099
- Hurray!
- We did it!

947
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,435
There's no need to worry
about being attacked now,

948
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:34,589
and it'll be easier for you to
remember Shinichi without me here.

949
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,810
D-Da...

950
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:44,067
It's alright. You can call me that
once you remember everything.

951
01:10:46,608 --> 01:10:51,602
Your detective league saved her!
That was excellent work!

952
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:57,161
He said we did excellent work...

953
01:10:57,185 --> 01:11:01,799
- A great detective...
...praised us!

954
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:04,302
Alright! Now we can
have all the fun we want!

955
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,170
I wanna see the parade!

956
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:08,973
We can stay until nighttime, right, Doc?!

957
01:11:08,997 --> 01:11:14,145
Yes. After all, Shinichi and Ran-kun
stayed until nighttime, too.

958
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:17,148
Hurray!

959
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:20,251
Is it really over now?

960
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:25,269
Hey, Ran! Let's go to the
Devil's Laboratory! It'll be fun!

961
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:40,137
Eh?! You're the famous Mori
Kogoro-san's assistant, little boy?!

962
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:41,272
Yeah!

963
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:45,476
If I help you, do you think
I could get Mori-san's autograph?!

964
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,844
Oh, me too!

965
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:48,145
Sure!

966
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:52,316
I can give you as many of that
old guy's autographs as you want!

967
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,318
Dr. Jinno, right?

968
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:57,822
I know it's not nice to say this,
but he was a creepy doctor.

969
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:02,126
That's for sure! He was a
tight-wad and had no skill at all!

970
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,129
He caused lots of problems
because of botched surgeries!

971
01:12:05,153 --> 01:12:09,400
Hey, remember that heart attack
patient that got brought in?

972
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:13,404
Dr. Jinno cut the other surgeon's
hand during that operation!

973
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:19,410
Yeah! Yeah! And that's the reason
that patient couldn't be saved!

974
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:21,766
Tell me more about that!

975
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:32,990
It's just as I thought!

976
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:35,005
I gotta tell the old man right away!

977
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:44,068
Hello, this is the Mori Detective Agency.

978
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:48,172
The great Mori Kogoro is
currently busy, solving...

979
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:49,390
Damn!

980
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:53,945
Kisaki Law Office.

981
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,380
- This is Conan!
- Oh, Conan-kun?

982
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:58,282
Is Kisaki-sensei there?!

983
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:03,187
Her trial just ended,
and she left for Tropical Land.

984
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:05,523
Tropical Land?

985
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,858
Apparently, Ran-san is there, so...

986
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:09,213
Oh, no!

987
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,190
"Metro Police"

988
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:56,340
Well? Able to talk now?

989
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:59,577
I got a phone call from a man.

990
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,413
Said he'd tell me the truth
behind my father's death.

991
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:05,783
So I went to the intersection in Beika.

992
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,452
But the man never showed,

993
01:14:08,476 --> 01:14:11,956
and Detective Narasawa was shot nearby!

994
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,527
When I returned home,
the man called again.

995
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:20,831
This time, he said to come to the
Midoridai Maison Park Apartments.

996
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:24,001
But again, he never showed up,

997
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:29,840
and Detective Shiba was found in the
basement parking lot, shot to death.

998
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:33,664
It was then I realized
I was set up by the killer!

999
01:14:35,503 --> 01:14:39,050
That night, I stayed at a business hotel.

1000
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:42,286
The next day, when
I checked my phone messages,

1001
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,555
a woman calling herself Detective Sato

1002
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:49,060
had left a message telling me to
come to the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.

1003
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,463
She said she'd arrest me
for murder if I didn't come.

1004
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:57,234
But, when I went,
the place was filled with police.

1005
01:14:57,258 --> 01:15:00,250
So I left, as if escaping.

1006
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,310
But then Detective Sato was...

1007
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:10,214
Why didn't you tell the police right away?

1008
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,504
Because I couldn't trust them,
after what happened to my father!

1009
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:22,426
I decided to ask the great Mori-san
for help, so I hung around him.

1010
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,864
Are you saying you didn't
approach Ran-kun at Tropical Land?!

1011
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:31,035
That's right...
I was going to talk to Mori-san...

1012
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,571
Hold on, now! You had a knife!

1013
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:39,043
For protection.
The killer might try to kill me...

1014
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,878
W-Whoa, now...

1015
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:45,049
Then... the killer is someone else?!

1016
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:48,619
And he has a female conspirator!

1017
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:51,373
Ran... is in danger!

1018
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,440
"Labyrinth of Ice and Fog"

1019
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,946
Yeah! This should take me there!

1020
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:35,966
Um, is the observatory empty?!

1021
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:39,170
Yeah! Everyone's busy watching the parade!

1022
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,320
Thanks!

1023
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:45,193
Welcome to the Labyrinth of Ice and Fog!

1024
01:16:50,638 --> 01:16:53,198
Ran! Where?! Where are you?!

1025
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:01,592
Genta and the others?!
I didn't know they came too!

1026
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:04,528
Which means Ran is nearby!

1027
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:05,610
That's him!

1028
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,998
Ran!

1029
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:10,501
Oh, yeah! The detective badges!

1030
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,369
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Ayumi!

1031
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:14,872
Hey! Do you read me?! Respond!

1032
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,874
Conan-kun? I read you!

1033
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:19,610
Guess where we are!

1034
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:22,646
Don't be too shocked, now! Tropical Land!

1035
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,716
Hey! Calm down and listen closely!

1036
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,152
The killer is there with a gun, to kill Ran!

1037
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,720
Eh?!

1038
01:17:29,744 --> 01:17:34,725
Tell Ran to go through crowded
areas and get out of Tropical Land!

1039
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:36,842
Hey! Are you listening?!

1040
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:42,132
- Ran-oneesan! Run!
- There's a gun pointed at you!

1041
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:44,401
Watch out!

1042
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:45,803
Doc!

1043
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:49,540
People around me are
in danger, because of me...

1044
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:54,645
D-Don't leave, Ran-kun!
The killer wants to get you all alone!

1045
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:57,648
Ran-kun?! Ran-kun?!

1046
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:58,866
Damn!

1047
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:04,755
Ran's on the Island of Dreams
and Fairytales, the next place over!

1048
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:06,610
The only way to get there is...

1049
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:10,060
Next group, please!

1050
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:11,711
H-Hey! Little boy!

1051
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:26,927
There it is!

1052
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:00,878
Conan-kun!

1053
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,280
You're safe now, Ran-neechan!

1054
01:19:03,304 --> 01:19:05,568
Let's blend in with the crowd
and get out of here!

1055
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:08,340
This way!

1056
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:11,556
Dammit!

1057
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,844
So it doesn't matter what happens
to anyone, as long as Ran dies?!

1058
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:25,002
Help! There's a crazy person!

1059
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:26,926
- Jump into the boat!
- Eh?!

1060
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,421
Hey, you!

1061
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:45,589
Conan-kun! Where did
you learn to drive a boat?!

1062
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,791
My old man taught me in Hawaii!

1063
01:19:47,815 --> 01:19:48,941
Eh?

1064
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:56,367
Hey! We're safe now, wouldn't you say?

1065
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:57,619
No!

1066
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:12,000
My cola!

1067
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:14,799
Cola?!

1068
01:20:24,018 --> 01:20:26,213
20 minutes to 9:00!

1069
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:35,539
Conan-kun! Waterfall!

1070
01:20:35,563 --> 01:20:36,996
Hold on!

1071
01:20:57,952 --> 01:20:59,112
Let's hurry!

1072
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,076
Just a little more! Hang in there!

1073
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,727
Y-Yeah...

1074
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:17,848
Damn! He already caught up!

1075
01:21:17,872 --> 01:21:21,933
Climb up and hide behind the rocks! Hurry!

1076
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:36,967
C-Conan-kun?!

1077
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:43,123
No one's here; this place is closed
at night. You can show yourself.

1078
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:47,711
You're quite cautious.

1079
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:50,280
But there's no point in hiding...

1080
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:55,252
...because I figured out what Detective
Narasawa's message really meant.

1081
01:21:55,276 --> 01:21:59,990
He didn't grab the left side of his
chest to indicate the police notebook!

1082
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:01,572
He was indicating his heart!

1083
01:22:03,017 --> 01:22:07,931
One of the letters in the Japanese
word for "psychiatry" is heart!

1084
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:11,914
Isn't that right, Dr. Kazato Kyosuke?

1085
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,415
When did you figure out it was me?

1086
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:31,121
The first time I thought, "Oh?"
Was when I remembered the phone.

1087
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:35,792
First, right-handed people
don't dial with their left hand.

1088
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:39,263
Yes. You were left-handed.

1089
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,032
I see. That was careless of me.

1090
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:49,940
7 years ago, you were the best young
surgeon at Toto University Hospital.

1091
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:54,678
But one day, during an operation
handled by you and Jinno-san,

1092
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:58,900
he accidentally cut your
left wrist with a scalpel.

1093
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:08,625
Because of that accident, your
so-called "Golden Hand" was ruined.

1094
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:11,728
Because of your pride,
you abandoned the scalpel

1095
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:15,499
and switched from surgery to psychiatry.

1096
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:21,505
Ever since, perhaps out of pride,
you lived as a right-handed person.

1097
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,006
Exactly.

1098
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:27,311
Never imagined just dialing
a phone would get me found out.

1099
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:31,582
You transferred to Beika Yakushino
Hospital as a psychiatrist,

1100
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,985
and something happened between
you and Jinno-san one year ago.

1101
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:39,356
I ran into him again, just by coincidence!

1102
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:42,726
He invited me over for
a drink at his apartment.

1103
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:47,764
Drunk, I unleashed the suspicion
I had held in my heart for six years.

1104
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:50,222
I asked if that accident
had been on purpose.

1105
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:57,288
You're such a pushover.

1106
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,778
It had been on purpose after all!

1107
01:24:01,802 --> 01:24:06,016
That's when the bloodlust arose!

1108
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,353
He was being sued for
a botched operation at the time,

1109
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,540
so he had plenty of reason to kill himself.

1110
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:21,231
As expected, the investigation
deemed it a suicide.

1111
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:26,136
But you knew the case
was going to be re-opened.

1112
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,606
Yes, I heard from Detective Narasawa,
who transferred to the Beika Police.

1113
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:34,411
The death of his partner, Detective
Tomonari, was a shock for him,

1114
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,813
so he came to me for counseling.

1115
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:41,151
I also learned from him that
Tomonari Makoto blamed the police!

1116
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:46,056
So, before the re-opening of the
case brought the police to you,

1117
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,560
you shot the three detectives
and lured Tomonari Makoto-san

1118
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:52,162
to the scenes to pin the blame on him?

1119
01:24:52,186 --> 01:24:58,268
That's right. For Detective Narasawa
and Detective Shiba, I called him myself.

1120
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:00,270
For Detective Sato...

1121
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:06,176
...you edited a tape you recorded
of a female patient. Right?

1122
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,178
Precisely.

1123
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:12,316
You heard that Detective Narasawa
died holding his notebook

1124
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,618
from Inspector Shiratori, didn't you?

1125
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:17,521
I am his doctor, after all.

1126
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:22,993
And then, to suggest it was the
detective's son, Narasawa Makoto,

1127
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:27,497
you purposely put the police
notebook in Detective Shiba's hand!

1128
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:33,337
Impressive work, Conan-kun!
But there's no proof that I did it.

1129
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:39,376
When Detective Sato was shot, no
gunpowder traces were found on me.

1130
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,480
If you'd like, I can
explain that trick for you!

1131
01:25:43,504 --> 01:25:44,681
What?!

1132
01:25:44,705 --> 01:25:47,731
After the police arrest you, that is.

1133
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:05,769
- This way!
- Eh?!

1134
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:06,272
"Authorized Personnel Only"

1135
01:26:06,297 --> 01:26:08,271
"Authorized Personnel Only"
He'll be waiting for us at that exit!

1136
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:08,659
He'll be waiting for us at that exit!

1137
01:26:30,217 --> 01:26:31,661
Where is this?

1138
01:26:31,685 --> 01:26:34,731
The main isle of the Island
of Adventure and Frontier!

1139
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:37,267
We passed under the ocean
from that small island!

1140
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,002
Really?

1141
01:26:39,026 --> 01:26:40,186
Let's go!

1142
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:48,178
We still haven't finished our discussion!

1143
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:51,348
Damn! He followed us in a boat!

1144
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:55,685
I can't have you revealing that trick, now.

1145
01:26:55,709 --> 01:27:01,191
It'd make me one of the possible
people who shot Detective Sato.

1146
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,727
Even if Ran gives her eyewitness testimony,

1147
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:07,130
you can still play innocent due to
the lack of gunpowder traces, huh?

1148
01:27:07,154 --> 01:27:11,902
That's right. Because Ran-kun
only saw me for a second.

1149
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:15,238
But I'd rather nip these
dangerous buds early on!

1150
01:27:15,262 --> 01:27:19,543
So let's hear if your theory is right or not.

1151
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,211
My pleasure!

1152
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:26,750
First, after you blacked
out the hotel's 15th floor,

1153
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,252
you put on surgical gloves

1154
01:27:29,276 --> 01:27:34,825
and took an umbrella you prepared
in advance to the ladies' room.

1155
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:38,962
You made a hole near the tip
of the umbrella ahead of time.

1156
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:42,251
You stuck your gun through that hole and fired.

1157
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:51,757
In short, the umbrella protected
you from the gunpowder and smoke.

1158
01:27:53,033 --> 01:27:57,681
That's why you didn't test
positive for traces of gunpowder!

1159
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:01,852
I assume you flushed the gloves
down one of the men's toilets?

1160
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:05,188
Correct, Conan-kun!

1161
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:08,658
It seems you will have to die.

1162
01:28:08,682 --> 01:28:11,276
C-Conan-kun...

1163
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,614
- Tell me! Why?!
- Eh?!

1164
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:35,473
Why are you going so far to protect me?

1165
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:39,176
Tell me... Why?

1166
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:45,695
- Because I love you!
- Eh?!

1167
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:51,067
Because I love you! More than anyone...

1168
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:52,524
...on this Earth!

1169
01:28:54,094 --> 01:28:55,152
Jump!

1170
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,475
- Take a deep breath!
- Eh?!

1171
01:28:58,499 --> 01:28:59,864
Hurry!

1172
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:12,211
Thanks!

1173
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:15,178
Mr. Grownup!

1174
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,494
Yeah.

1175
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,917
Damn it!

1176
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:38,748
46 seconds!

1177
01:29:38,772 --> 01:29:39,966
He's here!

1178
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:46,423
What do you say we end it here, Conan-kun?

1179
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,611
Besides, you have no place left to run...

1180
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:59,402
C-Conan-kun!

1181
01:29:59,426 --> 01:30:02,806
L-I'm fine! It only grazed my arm!

1182
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:06,322
I just told you. There's no place left to run!

1183
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:14,284
If you kill Ran now, won't Tomonari
Makoto-san be proven innocent?

1184
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:19,289
That's right. I planned to eliminate
Tomonari before he got arrested...

1185
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,991
...but that can't be helped now.

1186
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:25,962
Now, then. I guess this
should be "ladies first"?

1187
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:28,398
Ten. Nine.

1188
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:29,599
Eight.

1189
01:30:29,623 --> 01:30:30,600
Seven.

1190
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:31,968
Six.

1191
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:34,337
- Five.
- Some kind of magic charm?

1192
01:30:34,361 --> 01:30:35,405
Three!

1193
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:36,740
Two!

1194
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:37,753
One!

1195
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:48,018
No, Ran-san!

1196
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:49,441
Detective Sato!

1197
01:30:56,016 --> 01:30:57,994
Here! You must be thirsty!

1198
01:30:58,018 --> 01:30:59,007
One!

1199
01:31:15,502 --> 01:31:17,480
Distance yourself from me!

1200
01:31:17,504 --> 01:31:21,668
You're through once the
fountains stop! Give it up!

1201
01:31:31,685 --> 01:31:34,130
A childish trick!

1202
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:35,553
There you are!

1203
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:44,140
Die!

1204
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:45,563

I remember that you shot Detective Sato,

1215
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,451
and that I was champion of
the city karate tournament!

1216

Mom! Dad!

1222
01:33:02,676 --> 01:33:04,654

Of course, Suzuki Sonoko, my friend for life!

1226
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:17,283
Ran...

1227
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:24,453
Ran! Thank goodness!

1228
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:30,647
So he was the killer after all?

1229
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:35,952
Superintendent Odagiri re-opened
the case himself, and filled us in.

1230
01:33:35,976 --> 01:33:39,489
That's no fair, Conan!
Catching him yourself!

1231
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:43,793
Don't be silly! Conan-kun wanted
to keep you out of harm's way!

1232
01:33:43,817 --> 01:33:49,766
- That's exactly it!
- We're in the same detective league!

1233
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,534
Sorry, sorry!

1234
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:54,037
Huh? You're bleeding, Conan-kun...

1235
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:56,206
- Eh?
- Here.

1236
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,774
Thanks.

1237
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:01,063
Things are well, for now.

1238
01:34:02,669 --> 01:34:04,681
Yeah...

1239
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:07,684
Well done, Mr. Great Detective!

1240
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,453
Tamaki-san! What are you doing here?!

1241
01:34:10,477 --> 01:34:13,890
I came to keep an eye on Toshiya.
He played here today.

1242
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:16,226
Turned out to be pointless, though!

1243
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:21,531
Still, what was that about putting
your life on the line to protect Ran?

1244
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:25,635
It was Conan-kun and Dr. Agasa
who risked their lives for her!

1245
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:27,837
N-No, uhh...

1246
01:34:27,861 --> 01:34:30,659
In any case, what a relief that she's alright!

1247
01:34:32,699 --> 01:34:35,011
- Seriously?!
- Yes!

1248
01:34:35,035 --> 01:34:38,648
Everyone! Sato-san is conscious again!

1249
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:40,583
There's no need to worry anymore!

1250
01:34:40,607 --> 01:34:42,598
Oh! Really?!

1251
01:34:49,082 --> 01:34:50,927
Sato-san!

1252
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:52,762
This is wonderful, Takagi-san!

1253
01:34:52,786 --> 01:34:54,664
That's great!

1254
01:34:54,688 --> 01:34:56,766
That wraps everything up!

1255
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:58,835
Don't be stupid!

1256
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:02,205
There's still Toshiya's extortion case!

1257
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,774
His victim is dead now,

1258
01:35:04,798 --> 01:35:08,044
but give him a good
wringing and get all the facts!

1259
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:09,729
Understood, sir!

1260
01:35:12,205 --> 01:35:17,020
It would seem you were
the first to uncover the truth.

1261
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,055
Just who are you?

1262
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:21,309
Need not to know.

1263
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,352
I'm just a regular grade-schooler!

1264
01:35:49,943 --> 01:36:00,029
If there was no impurity in this world,

1265
01:36:00,053 --> 01:36:11,007
we could've loved each other
without changing form

1266
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:21,551
Why does time divide people?

1267
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:31,027
Please, stay by my side, just for now

1268
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:41,738
I grow stronger because I have you

1269
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:53,149
The vowed ring is so sparkly and pretty

1270
01:36:53,173 --> 01:37:05,728
You will realize little dreams too

1271
01:37:05,752 --> 01:37:12,920
You are the one, my heart is filled

1272
01:37:25,205 --> 01:37:35,858
I grow stronger because I have you

1273
01:37:35,882 --> 01:37:47,136
The vowed ring is so sparkly and pretty

1274
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:59,816
You will realize little dreams too

1275
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:08,077
You are the one,
someday they will come true

1276
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,871
Thanks, Conan-kun!

1277
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:26,275
You said those things earlier to
help me get my memory back, right?

1278
01:38:26,299 --> 01:38:27,810
Eh?

1279
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:34,083
You heard it at the hotel, right?
How my dad proposed to my mom!

1280
01:38:34,107 --> 01:38:40,056
"I love you. More than anyone on this Earth."

1281
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,825
So you said the same thing on purpose!

1282
01:38:42,849 --> 01:38:46,295
- The old guy said that?!
- Huh? It wasn't on purpose?

1283
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:49,332
N-No, uhh, it was.

1284
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,434
I thought so!

1285
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:56,272
After all, the two of us have
too much of an age difference!

1286
01:38:56,296 --> 01:38:59,288
But it made me happy! Good night!

1287
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:03,135
Good night...

1288
01:39:06,973 --> 01:39:08,964
Ah, well.

1289
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:13,356
Wait a minute! That means...

1290
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:17,627
...I thought up the same thing he did?!

1291
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:19,050
Ugh...
