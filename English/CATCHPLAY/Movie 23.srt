Thank you.

00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,409
Did I make you wait?

4
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:01,200
This is a strange place to meet.

5
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:03,074
Can we talk in Japanese?

6
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:05,492
So that people around us won't understand.

(SHERILYN TAN (40) LAWYER)
If there are people around,

8
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,824
you can't do anything strange, right?

(LEON LOWE (43) BUSINESS CONSULTANT)
Those are quite some words there.

10
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,408
It's like I'm after you or something.

11
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,075
You're not?

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,909
I thought I've been keeping
a great friendship with you.

13
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,200
Stop the small talk.

14
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:24,659
Just tell me your answer to my suggestion.

15
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,159
Yes? Or no?

16
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,117
Before I answer that,
let me guess what you ordered.

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,283
Iced Tea? No, not that.

18
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:42,824
Champagne... No, wine.

H-How did you know that?

23
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,659
I read your mind.

24
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,534
I don't want it!

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,117
Oh, hold on.

26
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,658
What?

27
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,200
My answer is "no."

You were his favourite student, right?

Could you ask him not to interfere too much?

I can't ask that...

Professor, it's this.

That person is going to be
in this tournament!

Sonoko started talking about
going to watch the match.

She asked Pops Kogoro and Ran
to go with her.

101
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,658
She invited me, too,

102
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,074
but I can't leave the country
looking like this.

103
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,034
That's true.

104

The passport is still
in Shinichi's name, too.

105
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,824
So I'm begging you, Haibara.

106
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,659
You're persistent!

107
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,784
Maybe you should give up this one time.

108
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,617
I really wanted to go.

109
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,116
Don't hang your head down so much!

110
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,908
I know, I'll take your mind off of things!

111
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:02,574
What, weâ€™re doing this already?

112
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:05,866
It's an Asian quiz!

113
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:10,199
What is the most popular event
in Singapore?

114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,283
One, singing the national anthem.

115
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:14,783
Two, celebrating lunar new year.

116
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,116
Three, hoisting the national flag.

117
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,784
Four, Marina Bay fireworks festival?

118
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,658
What's with the outfit?

119
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,742
The answer is simple.

120
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,991
It's hoisting the national flag,

121
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,241
because the center is a pole.

122
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,074
Oh! Correct!

123
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,616
I wouldn't expect any less from you.

124
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,574
All right, one more question.

125
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:34,742
That's enough.

126
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,034
All in all, it's a bit lonely here
without the kids.

127
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,242
Sheesh. That Haibara...

128
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:19,033
Ran! Uh, hey Ran.

129
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,074
What are you doing

130
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,492
all the way out... here...

131
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:27,033
Ran?

132
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:30,450
I've been waiting for you this whole time.

133
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,033
Wh-What is this place?

134
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,158
- It's really huge...
- Ran's voice!

135
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,658
Where is this place?

136
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,491
I'm locked up inside something.

137
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,700
Crap.

138
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:49,659
All right, with this...

139
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:10,075
The... Merlion?

140
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:17,742
Wha...

141
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,617
I'm in Singapore?!

142
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,367
DETECTIVE CONAN
THE FIST OF BLUE SAPPHIRE

143
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,491
I'm a high school detective,
Shinichi Kudo.

144
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:49,408
While at a theme park with
my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mori,

145
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:50,699
I witnessed a shady business deal

146
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,492
between two men dressed in all black.

147
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,283
Being distracted by watching the deal,

148
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:00,742
I didn't notice one of their partners
sneaking up behind me.

149
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,950
That man force-fed me poison,

150
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,492
and when I woke up...

151
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,325
...my body had shrunk!

152
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,033
But if they found out
that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

153
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,075
my life and the lives of those around me
would be in jeopardy.

154
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,241
With Professor Agasa's advice,

155
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,408
I decided to hide my identity,

156
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,116
and when Ran asked me my name,

157
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,241
I spontaneously said "Conan Edogawa."

158
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,241
In order to get information on those thugs,

159
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:35,367
I arranged to live with Ran,
whose dad is a private detective.

160
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,741
One of my biggest rivals is this guy.

161
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,075
Kid the Phantom Thief.

162
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,699
He's a mysterious thief
and a master of disguise as well.

163
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,283
He also knows who I really am somehow,

164
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:49,158
so I can't let my guard down.

165
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,117
Someday, I'll capture him
with my own hands.

166
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,533
And Kid has a rival, too,
named Makoto Kyogoku.

167
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,033
Despite being a high school student,

168
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,658
he's a karate expert who is undefeated
in over 400 matches.

169
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,533
For some reason, he's head over heels

170
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,283
for Sonoko Suzuki, Ran's classmate

171
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,074
and the daughter of the Suzuki Group.

172
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,241
What are you looking at?

173
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:07,409
Hurry up and do your usual thing!

174
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,742
Although I've become smaller,
my intelligence is the same!

175
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,409
A great detective
who leaves no case unsolved!

176
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,575
There is always only one truth!

177
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,950
My hands...

178
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,242
Professor's tools are gone, too.

179
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,825
That's right, Ran should be here, too!

180
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,617
Wait, Ran!

181
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,992
Hey, Shinichi! Over here, over here!

182
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,199
Sorry, sorry.

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,824
I made you wait a bit, didn't I?

184
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,324
Where have you been?

185
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,741
We've been looking for you, you know!

186
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,116
Pops said he was hot,

187
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,159
so I took him to rest in some shade.

188
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,991
I see. Thanks.

189
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:55,033
Sheesh, your dad's the same as always.

190
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:57,783
Hey, Ran! Can you go buy me some water?

191
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,783
You're so hopeless.

192
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,034
Hey, let's go together!

193
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,533
- Come on, hurry!
- Uh, s-sure!

194
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,700
Oh, jeez. It's looking good!

195
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,950
Damn that guy!

196
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,616
Man, that brings me back to life.

197
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:18,200
Huh? Dad, what are you
wearing around your neck?

198
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,116
I got my passport in here

199
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,283
so that it doesn't get lost or stolen.

200
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,533
It's great, isn't it?

201
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:27,824
Dad, you really don't have to do that.

202
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,199
Singapore is a safe place.

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,158
Yo. Looks like you're up.

204
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,950
So it really was you...

205
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:36,658
Anyways, how'd you get out of the suitcase?

206
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:37,783
With this.

207
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:40,324
If I stick the tip of this thing in,

208
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:43,283
you can pretty easily
open stuff from the inside.

209
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,283
I thought a ball-point pen
wouldn't be a problem,

210
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,242
but I can't let my guard down, huh?

211
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:50,450
That's my line, Kid the Phantom Thief!

212
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,867
Oh, here it is!

213
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,116
Anyways, what are you up to with all this?

214
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,075
You already know what this is about.

215
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:00,575
That.

216
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,949
That's Sonoko's...

217
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,700
At the end of the 19th century,

218
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,991
a legendary treasure aboard a pirate ship

219
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,367
is said to have sunk
near the shores of Singapore.

220
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,116
One of the largest
blue sapphires in the world...

221
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:22,825
Also known as the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

222
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,949
(WORLD WATCH)
It's the big jewel Mr. Zhonhan Chen

223
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,324
(SALVAGING TREASURE)
successfully salvaged

224
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,700
(FROM A PIRATE SHIP ~ SINGAPORE)
last year.

225
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:33,199
Zhonhan Chen is a big figure
in Singapore, isn't he?

226
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,284
Right. And this old-timer
is a huge fan of martial arts.

227
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,949
He embedded the jewel
into a champion belt

228
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,408
and decided he was going to hold
a karate tournament.

229
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:45,492
The legendary jewel will be
in the hands of the winner.

230
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,824
So, a rich man's pastime.

231
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:48,909
That's what this is.

232
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:50,533
I thought I'd take just the jewel

233
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:53,866
while hidden
in the hubbub of the tournament,

234
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:57,158
but I can't enter this country as Kid,
you know?

235
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,117
If you were after just the jewel,

236
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,867
you didn't need to bring me here as well.

237
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,409
I have slightly special circumstances
this time around.

238
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,159
I'll give you the details in due time.

239
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,867
You...

240
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,158
Huh, Shinichi?

241
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,866
- Oops, she's calling for me.
- Have you run off again?

242
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,117
Hold it, Kid!

243
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,783
If you do something to Ran,

244
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,200
you're going to pay for it!

245
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,616
S-Sorry, but I can't guarantee that.

246
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,574
Then I'll disclose your true identity
right here right now!

247
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,825
You probably shouldn't.

248
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,991
You were able to enter this country

249
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,075
thanks to this suitcase.

250
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,158
A special one that blocks the X-rays
at the carry-on luggage check.

251
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,324
Inside is an oxygen generator

252
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,116
that lasts at least 12 hours

253
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,324
and it's lined with the best cushioning

254
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,866
to prevent body aches,

255
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,825
even after being in it for a long time.

256
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,158
You know what this means,

257
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,367
don't you, great detective?

258
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,283
Without my help,

259
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,699
you can't leave this country

260
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,449
because you don't have a passport.

261
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,617
That means you can't return to Japan.

262
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,409
There you are, Shinichi!

263
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,617
You're so quick to run off somewhere...

264
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,325
I-It's that kid!

265
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,616
Why is he here?

266
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:16,699
Conan?

267
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,075
Oh, he's running away.

268
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,908
See? What a surprise, huh?

269
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:23,324
This kid is apparently one of the locals.

270
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,617
What? Really?

271
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,449
- In any case, he really looks like...
- You guys are way too gullible.

272
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,949
Little boy, what's your name?

273
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,992
Wait, do you understand Japanese?

274
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,742
Um...

275
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,325
This boy...

276
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:43,867
Arthur! My name is Arthur Hirai!

277
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,199
Arthur Hirai?

278
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,908
My mother is Japanese, so...

279
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:50,866
I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

280
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,699
I'm Ran Mori.

281
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,034
And that's my dad Kogoro Mori over there.

282
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,949
Nice to meet you.

283
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,991
Y-Yeah, nice to meet you.

284
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,783
Ran, I'm sorry,

285
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:05,116
but I'm going to get going now.

286
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:05,992
Oh, yeah.

287
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,783
So, where's your father and mother?

288
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:13,117
Um... they're in Japan right now.

289
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,699
Arthur, you're staying home all alone?

290
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,366
Yeah, but I'm fine. I'm used to it.

291
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,200
Is that so...

292
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,617
If that's the case,
you want to come with us?

293
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,200
I can?

294
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,659
Yeah, of course!

295
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,699
Oh, that's right.

296
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,034
I'm going to go check up on Dad, too!

297
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,034
S-Sure.

298
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,158
In any case, he's late.

299
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,241
He could at least text me.

300
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:40,325
I thought we were meeting up right here.

301
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,658
You're in the way, move!

302
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,408
Outta the way!

303
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,909
What you lookin' at, huh?

304
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,158
What's up with them?

305
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,033
The guy in the middle is Reijiro Nakatomi.

306
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,533
Nakatomi...

307
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,199
Oh, the president of Nakatomi Shipping.

308
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,741
(REIJIRO NAKATOMI (39))
He's known to be a go-getter,

309
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,909
(NAKATOMI MARITIME TRANSPORTATION PRESIDENT)
but there are no ends to his shady rumors.

310
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,616
Hey girl,

311
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:04,116
are you alone
all the way out here in Singapore?

312
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,408
You want to hang out with...

313
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,241
I don't have time for that right now.

314
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,492
Go away.

315
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,449
Can you afford to say stuff like that?

316
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,241
If I really felt like it,

317
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,491
(ARE YOU HERE YET?)
it's easy to drag you into a car.

318
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,742
(I'M WAITING IN FRONT OF THE MERLION)
it's easy to drag you into a car.

319
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,492
Sonoko!

320
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:20,158
Shinichi?

321
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,450
Don't go out of your way.

322
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,867
Hey!

323
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,759
She's with me. Is there a problem?

324
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,449
Y-You're...

325
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,949
Makoto! At least read your texts!

326
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,116
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:47,825
I'm really not good with machines.

328
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,991
O-Ouch!

329
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:53,199
Y-You'll pay for this!

330
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,199
I won't let you go easy next time!

331
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,449
Makoto! I was so scared!

332
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,741
I'm so sorry I'm late.

333
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,824
Mister, you're awesome!

334
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,742
I can do that, too!

335
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,616
Hey, karate boy!

336
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,117
How brave.

337
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,950
Hey, come on!

338
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:20,784
Sonoko, are you all right?

339
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,825
Yeah, because Makoto protected me.

340
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:26,408
It's been a while, Mr. Kyogoku.

341
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,492
Same here.

342
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:28,825
And you are?

343
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,491
Nice to meet you.

344
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,824
I'm Shinichi Kudo.

345
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,534
I'm Makoto Kyogoku.

346
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,991
Makoto, is something the matter?

347
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:43,949
Oh, it just doesn't feel like

348
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,742
it's my first time meeting Mr. Kudo.

349
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,367
N-No, I'm sure its just your imagination!

350
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,033
Well, now that we've seen the Merlion,

351
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,367
let's head over to the hotel.

352
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,575
About that...

353
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:04,324
You can't enter the tournament anymore?

354
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,242
We came all the way out here
to see your matches!

355
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,199
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,533
I had entered today's tournament

357
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:14,324
thanks to an invitation
from a certain individual.

358
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,033
You mean a sponsor?

359
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:16,825
Yes.

360
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:20,574
A lawyer named Sherilyn Tan

361
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,116
offered to cover all the expenses

362
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,991
and asked me if I would like to enter.

363
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,950
However, that person suddenly passed away.

364
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,699
One of her associates told me today

365
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,866
to forget about this whole deal.

366
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,116
That can't be!

367
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,158
I heard the strongest contender in Singapore

368
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,992
would be entering this tournament, too.

369
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,159
He was someone that I wanted
to fight a match against just once.

370
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,492
That's it! I'll become that sponsor!

371
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,491
Leave it all to me!

372
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:53,825
Just what I'd expect from the daughter
of the Suzuki Group.

373
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,492
(UNCLE JIROKICHI CALL ENDED)

374
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,116
Everything is all straightened out!

375
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,283
Makoto, you've been reentered

376
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,866
to the tournament as an invite!

377
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,241
Is that true, Sonoko?

378
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:04,034
Yup!

379
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,949
I made it so that Makoto will be
staying in the same hotel as us.

380
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,534
It's a double-date!

381
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,741
You're right.

382
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:15,158
If everything's all settled,

383
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,575
let's head back to the hotel.

384
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,158
I want to hurry up and throw back some beer.

385
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,325
Mr. Mori?

386
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,533
Is that you, Mr. Kogoro Mori?

387
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:25,075
Yeah.

388
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,533
I'm Rishi, a reserve police officer.

389
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:29,741
It's an honor to meet you.

390
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:32,074
Y-Yeah, that's quite...

391
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:35,824
So... a reserve police officer?

392
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:39,408
Yes! I am allowed to be special counsel

393
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,699
as a specialist
in criminal behavioral psychology!

394
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,116
Oh, I see.

395
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,075
Actually...

396
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,866
I received information
that you had entered this country

397
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,533
so I've been waiting for you.

398
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:50,949
Waiting for me?

399
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,825
Yes.

400
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:54,408
Many tourists stop by this location.

401
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:57,116
But why me?

402
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:59,324
Actually, there's been an incident where

403
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,450
I'd like to request
Detective Mori's assistance.

404
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,199
Oh, no, no!

405
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,074
I'm in the middle of vacation right now!

406
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:09,033
Oh, wait. I think we're better off
heading out with him.

407
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,741
Why?

408
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:12,449
Even if he's just a reserve police officer,

409
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,824
if you get along with him,

410
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,617
he may be able to recommend
cheap yet delicious places to eat.

411
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,367
Even a casino...

412
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,909
you know...

413
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:24,284
Well, you may be right!

414
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,116
All right! Great Detective Kogoro Mori

415
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,616
will lend you his strength!

416
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:31,992
- It's an honor!
- Come on, now.

417
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,491
Detective Mori, you're a hero in Japan,
my father's native country,

418
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,075
and I'm also a huge fan!

419
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,866
Actually, a certain businessman

420
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,242
received this in the mail.

421
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:45,945
(Advance Notice) (A legendary treasure guarded by
lions.) (Brilliantly glimmering a clear, deep blue.)

(LEON'S MANSION)

425
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:54,866
I received the report that

427
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,199
Can you beat him?

(HEZLI JAMALUDDIN (25)LEON'S SECURITY CHIEF)
There is no need for concern

429
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,699
No matter who

430
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,742
I will put him down with only one blow

431
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,284
Good to know

432
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,700
Come in

433
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:09,950

435
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,783
with someone
he like to introduce

436
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,074
He's early

Please bring him into the lounge

439
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:22,867
So, how about Kid?

440
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:26,284
Apology, We're still investigating

There is issue handling information.

443
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:33,991
I have a hunch who was behind it

444
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:35,575
You take care with that

445
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,199
Oh, man! This is amazing!

I'm really sorry about my dad.

Anyway, who is this guy named Leon Lowe?

453
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:04,574
Mr. Lowe was a prolific
criminal behavioral psychologist

454
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:05,866
and has apprehended many

455
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:08,616
dangerous criminals together
with the police.

456
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:12,866
I see, so he's like
the great detective of Singapore.

457
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,991
He parted ways with the police force
two years ago

458
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,116
and is now the president

459

of a very successful security firm.

460
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,491
I was taught criminal behavioral psychology
by Mr. Lowe as well.

461
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,991
I see.

462
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:27,699
So, this Leon guy got the advance notice?

463
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,158
No, I will explain in due order.

464
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,241
First, please take a look at this.

465
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:34,199
Kid the Phantom Thief is targeting a jewel

466
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,074
called the Fist of Blue Sapphire,

467
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:38,574
and it's owned by a businessman

468
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,659
named Mr. Zhonhan Chen.

469
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,324
Kid's advance notice arrived at his place.

470
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:47,199
Then, wouldn't it be better
to go see this Zhonhan guy?

471
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,325
Actually, the jewel is being stored
in the basement of this mansion.

472
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,616
The jewel is here?

473
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:54,908
Yes.

474
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,949
It was the owner's wish.

475
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,866
This safe has been independently developed

476
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:00,616
with a state-of-the-art system

477
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:01,908
and compared to bank safes...

478
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,908
State-of-the-art, huh?

479
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,283
Looks like even Kid is going to have
a hard time with this one!

480
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:09,033
What a thing to say.

481
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,741
What are you talking about?

482
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,658
Even the most state-of-the-art safes

483
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,116
are a piece of cake for Mr. Kid!

484
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:16,241
Hey, Sonoko...

485
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:18,158
You know what I'm talking about, Ran.

Mr. Kid's graceful techniques in theft!

Any woman from anywhere on the globe

488
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,033
will have her heart stolen...

489
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,617
Stop, Sonoko.

490
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:34,658
W-Well, that's everyone
except for me and Ran!

491
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:35,783
Right, Ran?

492
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,742
Y-Yeah, of course!

493
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,491
If things get bad,
you won't get out of this safely.

494

Hey, hey, hey.

495
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:50,116
What a wonderful courtyard!

496
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,658
It's not bad.

497
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,075
It's a pleasure to meet everyone.

498
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,741
My name is Leon Lowe.

499
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:58,824
Please allow my bodyguard
and chief of security

500
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:01,992
Hezli Jamaluddin to stay with us as well.

501
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,325
Mr Kyogoku?

502
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,075
I was hoping to see you

503
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,284
Thank you,

504
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:14,992
I do karate too

505
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,784
I always want to have a match with you!

506
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,013
I have my own gym in this masion

507
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,158
Oh! So, you're the great detective
Mr. Kogoro Mori!

508
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,408
Well, now, nice to meet you.

509
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:27,949
I didn't realize my fame extended

510
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,409
all the way out to foreign countries.

511
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
It's weird!

512
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,409
I dont feel anything

513
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,367
What is it?

514
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:40,617
No way

515
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,075
And the high school detective,
Mr. Shinichi Kudo.

516
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,575
Nice to meet you.

517
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:49,617
It seems you're more
of a magician than a detective.

518
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:52,992
It's your fingers.

519
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,159
They're so thin yet refined.

520
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:58,116
Though I'm a detective, I fight up here

521
00:25:58,117 --> 00:25:59,992
more than with physical strength.

522
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:01,991
I see.

523
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:06,866
Oh, that must be
Miss Sonoko Suzuki over there.

524
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,534
You can't let your guard down with this guy.

525
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:12,034
You can't come in, please wait!

526
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:14,492
That's ok, dont bother

527
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,241
(ZHONHAN CHEN (70))
Mr. Kogoro Mori!

528
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,324
(SINGAPORE FINANCIAL AUTHORITY)
My wife and I are big fans of yours!

529
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,991
Y-Yeah...

530
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:24,616
- Mind if I take a photo?
- Photo?

531
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,949
- Sorry, but he come in all sudden
- Ah, a picture! Okay okay, of course!

532
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,992
It's alright

533
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,658
I will like to show everyone our safe room

534
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,324
That's good, I love to come along.

535
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:35,991
I'd like everyone to see

536
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:39,200
the Fist of Blue Sapphire up close, too!

537
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,700
Beyond these doors is the pride
of our company, the safe room.

538
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:49,034
Only select individuals
can open the entrance.

539
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,616
The walls are made of a fireproof alloy

540
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:08,283
and are indestructible.

541
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:08,867
What!?

542
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:10,533
- All outside broadcast frequencies
- Sorry Sorry! Nothing!

543
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:11,700
-are completely blocked.

544
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,533
The location of the cargo
is set to relocate on a regular basis.

545
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,241
This safe is filled with my ideal,

546
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,742
so it's special and unique in this world.

547
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,200
Wh-What's this?

548
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,992
Everyone, please stand back a bit.

549
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:32,408
This is the jewel, the Fist of Blue Sapphire

550
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,199
said to be the proof of the king of pirates.

551
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,949
- This is one large blue sapphire.
- Can you see it, Arthur?

552
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,949
Yup! Thank you!

553
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,616
I see. As long as it's here,

554
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,408
not even Kid will be able
to get his hands on this.

555
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,949
But that's not quite how it goes.

556
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,116
During the tournament that starts tomorrow,

557
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:53,699
we must display the belt at the stadium
according to the rules.

558
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,783
In other words, during the tournament,

559
00:27:55,784 --> 00:27:58,908
it will be stored in a room at the venue.

560
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:01,116
We will have tight security,

561
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:02,574
but it will be inferior to this room.

562
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:03,325
I see.

563
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:05,825
But there is also security
for stadium?

564
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,742
Yes, leave it to us!

565
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:13,533
If anything happen to the Fist

566
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:17,117
You will be paying a hefty compensation fee.

567
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:21,199
You mentioned that the security
will be inferior to this room.

568
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,908
In other words,
you're thinking that Kid is waiting

569
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:26,449
for the sapphire
to be relocated to the stadium?

570
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,741
That's right.

571
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,241
It's too risky to target this location.

572
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,616
I agree.

573
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:32,824
I may not be of much help,

574
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,117
but please let me assist
in guarding the jewel.

575
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:37,617
Thank you!

576
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,075
Piece of cake!

577
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:25,617
I've got your fingerprints!

578
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:40,742
This was too easy, maybe?

579
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,492
I've been waiting for you.

580
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,534
Kid the Phantom Thief.

581
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,408
For you to make it all the way here...

582
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:55,909
Brilliant, as I expected.

583
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,159
You sure are confident.

584
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,033
Sorry to say,

585
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,492
but I can't just hand the jewel over to you.

586
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,117
I don't want to pay a compensation fee
to Zhonhan Chen.

587
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:10,908
And it's my job
to steal treasure of that nature.

588
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:15,366
The more difficult it is to steal...

589
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:17,117
the more fired up I get!

590
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,700
It's over

591
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,699
(Lock)

592
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,534
I hope you like to taste the
Singaporian ward.

593
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:03,992
I didn't expect him to use a taser.

594
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:39,575
Kid!

595
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,492
Are you serious?

596
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,075
What happ-

597
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:54,492
What happened?

598
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,492
It's Kid!

599
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,367
Don't worry, I always...

600
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,783
A top-tier guy always acts

601
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:05,367
with the worst-case scenario in mind!

602
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,449
...one step ahead

603
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,784
I have to hurry up and get out of here!

604
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:20,659
There he is!

605
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,491
What a jab...

606
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:47,367
It would've been terrible

607
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:48,616
if I didn't leap backwards.

608
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:52,908
Unlawful entry into a home, isn't it?

609
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:55,575
But wait, why are you here?

610
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:59,324
I was invited for some training here.

611
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:01,949
I didn't think I'd come to blows with you.

612
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,908
Oh, no, I don't want to do that at all.

613
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,284
Don't waste your breath!

614
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,659
Hold it!

615
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:09,992
Brace yourself!

616
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,366
A soccer ball?

617
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,158
Where did it come from?

618
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,492
Thanks, great detective!

619
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,866
This one's amazing!

620
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:53,074
I can fly at will even without wind.

621
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,825
I have to give thanks to Gramps!

622
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,950
But to think... he's gone that far...

623
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,491
You saved me.

624
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,449
I knew it was the right call
to return your stuff just in case.

625
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,825
Though I didn't want to save you at all.

626
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,449
Anyways, isn't it about time you told me

627
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,825
the real reason why you brought me here?

628
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,491
Leon had been searching for

629
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,824
the Fist of Blue Sapphire for years now.

630
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,241
He was one step shy
of salvaging it for himself

631
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:46,659
when Zhonhan Chen beat him to it.

632
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:49,199
Apparently, the location of the sunken ship

633
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,867
was leaked out to Chen at some point.

634
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:56,074
The main suspect was Sherilyn Tan.

635
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,408
For a while, she was the legal adviser
for Leon's company,

636
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:01,242
but their relationship had turned sour.

637
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:05,658
Rumors say that
she became the sponsor for Kyogoku...

638
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,533
...to prevent Jamaluddin's championship.

639
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:08,242
In other words,

640
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:11,324
she wanted to stop Leon
from obtaining the jewel.

641
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,366
If that's true,

642
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:16,324
then the rumor that she leaked information
about the sunken ship

643
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,199
would gain more than just a grain of truth.

644
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,742
And then the same Sherilyn Tan was murdered.

645
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:23,783
If the rumors about the leaks are true,

646
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:27,116
Leon would have a motive
for Sherilyn's murder.

647
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:29,075
What do the police think about that?

648
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:30,908
Unfortunately,

649
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:33,242
Leon has been taken off
their list of suspects.

650
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:34,866
Why is that?

651
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,908
Because they have
an even more likely suspect.

652
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:39,242
A suspect?

653
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,824
The police haven't announced it yet,

654
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:46,533
but there was a card left behind

655
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:49,117
at the scene of Sherilyn Tan's murder.

656
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:51,200
My advance notice.

657
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,033
I get it.

658
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:57,074
But still, why do I have to see
such a breathtaking view

659
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,700
with this guy of all people?

660
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,825
If I had to see this with someone...

661
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,908
It's time to go back to being Arthur Hirai.

662
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,241
By the way, I know you got "Arthur"

663
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:18,408
from Arthur Conan Doyle,

664
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,784
but where is "Hirai" from?

665
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:21,367
That's...

666
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:25,533
taken from Ranpo Edogawa's real name,
Taro Hirai.

667
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:26,824
I see.

668
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:29,909
Anyways, this is definitely a trap!

669
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:32,241
I know that.

670
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:34,158
That's why I brought you with me,

671
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,450
great detective.

672
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,909
You excel at things like this, right?

673
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,033
I understand your reason,

674
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,909
but I don't like how you went about it.

675
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,575
I, the Kid,

676
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:48,742
can't stay quiet after what's been done,
can I?

677
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,949
You're late.

678
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,700
I've been waiting forever here.

679
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,575
Sorry about that.

680
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,534
Look.

681
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,867
It's a really beautiful nightscape.

682
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,367
It's so romantic.

683
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:18,408
Don't be so bashful.

684
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:20,616
We are dating, aren't we?

685
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:21,617
Y-Yeah.

686
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,534
Wait, you guys are?

687
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,699
Damn it, Ran,

688
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,116
can't you see that he's a fake?

689
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:30,199
Oh, but if she notices,

690
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,909
I won't be able to go back to Japan.

691
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:49,408
Nothing like a Singapore Sling

692
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,574
when in Singapore!

693
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:52,450
Give me another one!

694
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,450
Mr. Mori?

695
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:57,742
Oh, uh, you're...

696
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,575
Mind if I sit here?

697
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,658
P-P-Please, please do!

698
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:05,575
Let's drink together!

699
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,075
Actually, I...

700
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:16,324
Oh, my! What have I done?

701
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,867
I really am sorry.

702
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:21,034
Oh, no, please don't worry about it.

703
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:25,325
Mr. Mouri, a call for you.

704
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,491
Callï¼Ÿ

705
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:30,199
It looks like you have a telephone call,
Mr. Mori.

706
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,450
For me? From who?

707
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,325
Mr. Mori?

708
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:37,784
There's something I must talk to you about.

709
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,492
Please come here tomorrow.

710
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,784
Jeez!

711
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,284
What? They hung up on me!

712
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,950
Time to booze up again!

713
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:03,033
(SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM)

714
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,533
Who do you think will win?

715
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:06,866
It'll be Mr. Kyogoku!

716
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,324
I mean, he's never lost!

717
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,658
Really? I've never heard of that before.

718
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:13,491
If you give enough effort in the right place

719
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,491
and in the right direction,

720
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:17,616
it will bear fruit.

721
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,408
Everyone got that?

722
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:20,700
Yup!

723
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,409
Who will get the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

724
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,949
That Jamaluddin guy
seems really crazy strong!

725
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,658
He's got the power of a heavyweight

726
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,699
along with speed and technique.

727
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,242
He looks like a tough opponent.

728
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,241
As expected from
the Teitan High Karate team captain!

729
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:06,659
You look at this
from a completely different angle!

730
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:11,408
Hey, if the jewel
falls into Kyogoku's hands,

731
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,574
wouldn't it be impossible for you to get it?

732
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,366
Yeah.

733
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:18,034
I don't want to get close to him
if I can help it.

734
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:23,450
Oh, here comes Makoto!

735
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:26,866
Come on everyone, cheer for him!

736
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:30,199
Wait, why is the local kid
tagging along with us?

737
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,325
Looks like he's taken a real liking to me.

738
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:44,034
Bow to each other

739
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,575
Begin

740
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
- Scary.
- He did it! Makoto, you're awesome!

741
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,033
I want to go see him right now.

742
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:08,075
(Calling: Dad)
Oh, it's from Dad.

743
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:11,949
I'm telling you, I'm nobody suspicious!

744
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,159
Dad!

745
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:15,158
What happened?

746
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:18,533
Ran, come on, explain to these guys!

747
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:20,991
I already took out
all the metal objects I have on me!

748
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,950
But still...

749
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:25,449
No entry

750
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,783
I've done enough already!

751
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,784
NO!

752
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,159
Damn it! I can't get in at this rate!

753
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,616
Mr. Mori, are you all right?

754
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:34,949
Mr. Rishi!

755
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,492
He is staff member, please let him in.

756
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:38,575
Yes sir!

757
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,116
Thank you Mr. Rishi!

758
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:41,659
I'm glad I could join up with everyone.

759
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,741
After the belt was presented
during the opening ceremonies,

760
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:45,866
it was taken to be stored

761
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:47,574
in the underground safe.

762
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,700
If you'd like,
I'll guide you there afterwards.

763
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,408
In any case, where have you been?

764
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,575
Well, um, I went on patrol for a bit.

765
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:58,575
I'm betting he overslept
because of a hangover.

766
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:03,699
The PIN code changes every 10 minutes.

767
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,491
It is maintained by a computer

768
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:07,075
that sends the code by email.

769
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,616
The only recipients of the email
are Inspector Aidan, myself,

770
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:14,200
and Mr. Lowe, who manages the safe.

771
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,866
This room really has nothing in it.

772
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,741
That's not quite true.

773
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:23,158
The floor has a weight sensor.

774
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,658
On the ceiling are surveillance cameras.

775
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:27,908
Police officers completely surround
the stadium as well.

776
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:29,658
Oh! If that's the case,

777
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:32,408
I'm sure that phantom thief
can't do anything!

778
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:33,409
Mr. Mori,

779
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,699
there's no smoking allowed here.

780
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,659
Oh, sorry about that.

781
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,242
(Rechel Cheong)

782
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:44,241
I completely forgot because I was drunk.

783
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,324
She gave this to me at the bar last night,

784
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:47,534
and said she had something to tell me.

785
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,866
This card belongs to Leon's secretary.

786
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:54,158
Is that so?

787
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,241
To be honest, I don't remember much of it
because I was drunk.

788
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,949
How do you know that?

789
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,658
It has the mark for Leon's company on it.

790
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,200
The mark, huh...

791
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,699
It says, "Tomorrow 3:00 p.m. Meet me

792
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,533
at the back of National Stadium gate 3."

793
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:13,366
It also says, "Tell no one."

794
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:17,284
I see, 3:00 p.m. means...

795
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,449
it's almost time!

796
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,949
Mr. Mori!

797
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,242
It's embarrassing
for a man to make a lady wait!

798
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,242
That was a truly marvelous match.

799
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,199
I'm already looking forward

800
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,908
to the semifinals and finals tomorrow.

801
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:46,783
Thank you very much.

802
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,199
Your strength is exceptional.

803
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,283
How about it?

804
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:52,784
Would you be interested in working for me
as a bodyguard?

805
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:55,867
If you'll excuse me...

806
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,533
Now, hold on a second.

807
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:03,284
That was just a joke, of course.

808
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:06,075
There's one thing
I wanted to ask you, though.

809
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:08,659
Tell me...

810
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:13,492
what purpose do your fists serve?

811
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:16,283
You seek greater strength,

812
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:18,034
but what lies beyond that?

813
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,784
What is the driving force behind you?

814
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:26,491
You can't answer that?

815
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:29,949
An imperfect fist with no goal
is a dangerous thing.

816
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,783
Not just for you.

817
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:34,658
It brings misfortune
to those around you as well.

818
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:37,283
Those around me? Misfortune?

819
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:38,242
Right.

820
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,575
For instance, someone you are in love with.

821
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:43,867
You have someone like that, don't you?

822
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,908
Your fist brings danger

823
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:50,033
and it may harm the one you love.

824
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:51,783
If something like that
were to happen to you,

825
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:53,742
what would you do?

826
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,534
I'm looking forward
to your matches tomorrow.

827
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:13,367
Is there something else?

828
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:17,616
Great job!

829
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:18,950
Sonoko.

830
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,991
Jeez, you didn't come out for a while,

831
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,449
so I came to see you instead!

832
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,366
I'm sorry to make you wait.

833
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:27,074
Now let's all go eat lunch together!

834
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:28,908
There's a restaurant I want to go to.

835
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:30,366
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

836
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:32,199
Can you two go eat by yourselves?

837
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,741
Why?

838
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,366
I'm really sorry!

839
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,366
I don't think
Shinichi can leave here anytime soon,

840
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,366
guarding the jewel and all.

841
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,283
I see.

842
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,741
Well, it can't be helped, huh?

843
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:46,074
I guess it's just the two of us, Makoto.

844
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:47,199
Okay.

845
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,283
See you later, Ran!

846
00:45:49,284 --> 00:45:50,866
Please excuse us.

847
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:53,616
I really want you to eat a whole lot!

848
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,909
Thank you so much.

849
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,324
Now, be alert

850
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:09,574
and look everywhere

851
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,617
If you see anything unusual,

852
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,116
report it

853
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,492
And act immediately!

854
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:15,867
And-

855
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:19,159
Are you okay?

856
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:21,241
I am so sorry!

857
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:22,617
I'm sorry too

858
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,450
Inspector Aidan!

859
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,284
Sorry, couldn't help but notice

860
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,575
I.. I.., I'm sorry, what?

861
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:41,284
There you go

862
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:43,450
Keep up the good work

863
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:45,200
Yes ma'am!

864
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,199
Everything okay with the safe?

865
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,284
Yes, sir, everything's alright

866
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,741
Excuse me, I'm so sorry

867
00:46:53,742 --> 00:46:54,617
What the matter?

868
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:57,617
Inspector Aidan is calling you to come quick

869
00:46:58,075 --> 00:46:59,533
Who? but what...

870
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:01,366
I will look after this place

871
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:02,533
Ok

872
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:04,534
We will be back soon, thank you!

873
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,492
Now...

874
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:15,284
I'll be taking the treasure!

875
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:35,784
It's mine.

876
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:40,909
Am I stuck on something?

877
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,242
A corpse? And...

878
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:52,950
It's Rechel!

879
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:54,991
This is bad!

880
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:56,367
I have to get out of here now!

881
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,117
There are some letters here.

882
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:05,367
Crap!

883
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,325
Stop right there!

884
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:18,825
Drop the gun down now!

885
00:48:19,284 --> 00:48:21,284
Kid, you were under arrest!!

886
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,909
What?!

887
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:30,824
(Gate 3)

888
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,491
Jeez, just how long
is Rechel going to make me wait?

889
00:48:34,492 --> 00:48:36,159
Let's wait for 10 more minutes and...

890
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:38,949
Wh-What's that?

891
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,449
Maybe it's Kid!

892
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,950
Oh, hey, wait!

893
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:46,992
He's here

894
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,199
This really looks bad.

895
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,325
But once I'm outside, the game is all mine.

896
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:02,992
There were this many of them?

897
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,284
Hey, wait!

898
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:18,909
Damn!!

899
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,824
Go!! Arrest him

900
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:21,784
at any cost

901
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:22,867
Yes, sir!

902
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:25,658
Come on, now. Is everything okay?

903
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:27,033
There you are, Mr. Mori!

904
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,283
I've been looking for you!

905
00:49:28,284 --> 00:49:31,200
Well, we sure have a big deal here.

906
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:34,159
To think Kid would show up
in broad daylight like this.

907
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:36,408
But rest assured!

908
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:37,783
The great detective Kogoro Mori is here,

909
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,283
and it won't be long...

910
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,700
We don't have time for that!

911
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,033
We have a huge situation on our hands!

912
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:44,950
Please come to the safe room right away!

913
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:49,659
Look!

914
00:49:50,284 --> 00:49:52,575
There is giant bird in the sky

915
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:03,200
If I've come this far...

916
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:15,158
Th-This is...

917
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:18,283
The victim is Mr. Lowe's secretary, Rechel.

918
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:19,784
Rechel?

919
00:50:21,242 --> 00:50:22,075
I see.

920
00:50:22,575 --> 00:50:24,533
Did you check the surveillance cameras?

921
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:26,658
No good. It's been hacked,

922
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:28,574
and it was set to show footage

923
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:31,117
with nobody showing on loop.

924
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:33,949
So, you have any ideas on the culprit?

925
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,658
Of course we do.

926
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,116
We're doing everything we can
to go after him.

927
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:41,033
Go after him? That means...

928
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:44,283
There's no doubt that the perpetrator
is Kid the Phantom Thief!

929
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:47,033
In any case, you only have yourself to blame

930
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:48,867
for not disabling the security device, Kid.

931
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:52,283
You know, if that's true,

932
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:54,783
Rechel was at the stadium
to meet up with this man

933
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,199
at that time, right?

934
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,408
Why was she here in the safe room?

935
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:01,367
Oh, come to think of it, that's true.

936
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,324
According to the police officer
in front of the safe room,

937
00:51:04,325 --> 00:51:07,616
she came here to relay a message
from Inspector Aidan.

938
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,116
Apparently it was urgent,

939
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:11,616
so that's probably
why they prioritized that.

940
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:14,324
And then there was
that ruckus right afterward.

941
00:51:14,325 --> 00:51:18,034
But Kid committing murder is unheard of...

942
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,074
Oh, hey!

943
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:22,699
Don't go in there without permission!

944
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,784
This brat, again!

945
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:26,784
(she)

946
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,408
Hey, about this message written in blood...

947
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:30,409
You little...

948
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:33,117
Brats should stay out of this!

949
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:41,158
Look at this.

950
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,075
I see.

951
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:47,200
You've been completely framed, Kid.

952
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,616
Bring it on.

953
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:59,200
I-It's getting rather interesting now.

954
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:03,949
As I'd expect from your selection,

955
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,408
both the chicken rice
and watermelon juice were very delicious.

956
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:08,409
Weren't they?

957
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,117
Something wrong?

958
00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:16,491
W-Well, now that our stomachs are full...

959
00:52:16,492 --> 00:52:20,074
Makoto, there's somewhere I'd like to go.

960
00:52:20,075 --> 00:52:21,575
I will follow you anywhere.

961
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:28,825
Aaahh.. This looks bad

962
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:30,449
Hey girl!

963
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,492
What are you gonna do about this?

964
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:35,534
Y-You're the one who ran into me!

965
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:38,616
Ha!? I don't know what you mean!?

966
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:39,367
Come here

967
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:58,699
There may be others hiding around here.

968
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,575
Sonoko,

969
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,574
please don't stray too far away from me.

970
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:02,825
O-Okay!

971
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:15,241
Your fist brings danger

972
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,950
and it may harm the one you love.

973
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,992
Sonoko!

974
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:56,699
There they are!

975
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,242
Please, help me!

976
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,367
Sonoko!

977
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:37,867
Sonoko!

978
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,117
Sonoko.

979
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,034
Sonoko!

980
00:54:49,742 --> 00:54:52,575
Sonoko! Sonoko!

981
00:55:01,534 --> 00:55:03,824
How are her wounds?

982
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:06,199
They said it wasn't life-threatening.

983
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,241
She's asleep for now,
so she'll stay here for tonight,

984
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:11,325
and they'll do tests in the morning.

985
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,284
I'm really glad.

986
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:16,492
In any case,

987
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,241
I can't forgive
malicious hit-and-run drivers!

988
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:19,450
It's my fault.

989
00:55:19,992 --> 00:55:23,242
It's all my fault that Sonoko...

990
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:26,450
Sorry to make you wait.

991
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:28,866
I'm sorry I'm late!

992
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,242
Thanks for putting in hard work!

993
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,449
How's the investigation going?

994
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,449
Right. The scene was a back street

995
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,866
with little pedestrian traffic.

996
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:37,449
There weren't any witnesses.

997
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,408
No, to be precise, there were people,

998
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,949
but they were caught off guard
and knocked unconscious

999
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,575
when the police car was stolen.

1000
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:51,741
Am I interrupting something?

1001
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:54,616
Mr. Lowe! Why are you here?

1002
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,866
I heard about the accident
and came right over.

1003
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,241
Sonoko is still asleep.

1004
00:55:59,242 --> 00:56:01,616
Then, can you hand this to her for me?

1005
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:02,784
Thank you so much.

1006
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,284
It looks like
what I was worrying about came true.

1007
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,325
The god of battle is giving you a trial.

1008
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:18,074
He's saying you still don't have the heart,
technique,

1009
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:19,867
and physique required to use your fist.

1010
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:23,825
That's right. I'll give you a talisman.

1011
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,075
It's something similar to a misanga.

1012
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:30,158
When this snaps off,

1013
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,491
it means that said god recognizes you now

1014
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,700
possess heart, technique, and physique.

1015
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,533
However, if you are to raise your fist
before it snaps off...

1016
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,117
You know what will happen, right?

1017
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:46,617
Ow!

1018
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,284
They got you pretty bad.

1019
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,866
This is nothing.

1020
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,616
Jeez, they shot without hesitation.

1021
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:56,575
This time, they had the upper hand on me.

1022
00:56:57,409 --> 00:56:58,949
Everyone is thinking that

1023
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,950
you're the one who murdered Rechel.

1024
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:03,034
Everything was a trap

1025
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,949
to put the blame on you.

1026
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,241
It's just like magic.

1027
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:10,492
I wasn't present at that location...

1028
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:12,616
but to the audience,

1029
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:14,783
it looks like I was right there

1030
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:16,950
in the role of the murderer.

1031
00:57:17,325 --> 00:57:19,741
So, if you flip the viewpoint,

1032
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:21,825
you can see the trick they used for it.

1033
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,699
Yeah. A magician is a guy who makes you

1034
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,491
think something is inside a clenched fist

1035
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,241
and a detective is a guy
who correctly guesses

1036
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:35,075
what's inside before that fist is opened,
right?

1037
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:47,075
So please give me the correct guess,
great detective...

1038
00:57:47,784 --> 00:57:49,199
about the contents

1039
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,617
of this mysterious fist called murder?

1040
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:53,825
Jeez.

1041
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:08,908
Little boy, you still haven't gone home?

1042
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:11,991
Hey, can I stay at your place tonight?

1043
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:14,616
What? Over at my place?

1044
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:17,367
Even if I go home, I'm all by myself.

1045
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:21,991
After what just happened, I'm scared.

1046
00:58:21,992 --> 00:58:23,866
If I say I'm staying with you, Mr. Rishi,

1047
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,617
I'm sure Dad and Mom will feel relieved.

1048
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:31,616
There's also nothing worse than
sleeping in the same room

1049
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:33,284
as him two nights in a row!

1050
00:58:40,492 --> 00:58:41,991
Wow, this is amazing!

1051
00:58:41,992 --> 00:58:45,324
Did your dad receive all of these?

1052
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:48,366
That's right. Dad was an oceanographer,

1053
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:50,408
though he passed away five years ago.

1054
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:51,533
During his research process,

1055
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:54,324
he found several ruins
that had sunk into the sea.

1056
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:56,199
You must be proud of your dad.

1057
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,284
Yup.

1058
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,033
Well, I still have some work left to do,

1059
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:01,784
so you can go to sleep before me, Arthur.

1060
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:03,450
All right.

1061
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:06,366
Hey, Rishi,

1062
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,533
what is this red mark on this map?

1063
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:11,616
Oh, this marks the location

1064
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:13,325
where ships were attacked by pirates.

1065
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:15,991
Do pirates still exist now, too?

1066
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:17,158
They do.

1067
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:20,408
In the past, there were many of them
around Singapore, too.

1068
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:23,699
Well, the current headache isn't pirates,

1069
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,575
but a murder case.

1070
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:27,991
That and Kid the Phantom Thief.

1071
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:30,950
I borrowed some reference materials
from inspector Aidan, but...

1072
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:35,075
I'm going to be up all night.

1073
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,533
I'm sorry I have to do this to you,

1074
00:59:42,534 --> 00:59:44,200
but I have to have you take a nap.

1075
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,949
Hey, what's that?

1076
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,699
Did you have something like that on?

1077
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,825
Sonoko! You came to!

1078
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,659
Actually, I did a while ago.

1079
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:18,241
I'm so glad! I really am.

1080
01:00:18,242 --> 01:00:20,574
So, is that some kind of a magic charm?

1081
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,492
Y-Yes, it's something along those lines.

1082
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:29,574
You shouldn't.

1083
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:31,075
You need to take it easy and rest up.

1084
01:00:32,617 --> 01:00:35,116
I'm not sleepy at all.

1085
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:38,033
I came all the way out to Singapore,
but this is boring.

1086
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,949
If you overexert yourself,
it's bad for your health.

1087
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,825
Please stay put for tonight.

1088
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:46,616
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you
for a while,

1089
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:49,367
but why don't you take that
Band-Aid near your left eyebrow off?

1090
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:54,075
W-Well, this is nothing at all, really.

1091
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:15,283
I thought we were not
supposed to meet

1092
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:17,408
after everything was done?

1093
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,866
Your pray your plan was perfect

1094
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,742
But are you totally sure?

1095
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,991
You look tough

1096
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:25,909
ut you actually
a coward

1097
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:28,450
Now, watch your mouth...

1098
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:39,658
I always keep promises.

1099
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:40,575
I do!

1100
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:50,909
An eye for an eye. That's how I roll.

1101
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:05,866
We have an announcement to make

1102
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,949
In the second semi-final match,

1103
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,116
Makoto Kyogoku who has withdraw

1104
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,824
And Tan Lee will proceed to the final

1105
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,074
Damn it

1106
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:15,909
I didn't ask for this

1107
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:18,741
You withdrew from the tournament?

1108
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:20,949
Why? Is it my fault?

1109
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,449
It's possible that the group

1110
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,158
that assaulted us may try again.

1111
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:27,825
I can't possibly leave your side like that,
Sonoko.

1112
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:30,908
So it really is my fault.

1113
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:32,491
Please stay in the tournament!

1114
01:02:32,492 --> 01:02:34,908
There was someone you wanted to fight,
wasn't there?

1115
01:02:34,909 --> 01:02:36,117
Yes.

1116
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:39,866
But, Sonoko, I couldn't even protect you.

1117
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:42,117
I feel like I'm still lacking something.

1118
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:45,992
Of course you're lacking something.

1119
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:48,908
You keep hiding stuff from me.

1120
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:50,116
Hiding things?

1121
01:02:50,117 --> 01:02:52,616
You didn't tell me anything
about that misanga,

1122
01:02:52,617 --> 01:02:54,159
nor about the Band-Aid.

1123
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:57,825
Well, this really is, um...

1124
01:02:58,784 --> 01:03:00,408
Get out!

1125
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,491
I don't want to be protected by a man

1126
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,367
who is full of lies!

1127
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,783
I really was worried about you yesterday,
okay?

1128
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:11,908
I couldn't reach you at all for a while.

1129
01:03:11,909 --> 01:03:13,283
Sorry, my bad.

1130
01:03:13,284 --> 01:03:16,116
I got so engrossed in chasing after Kid.

1131
01:03:16,117 --> 01:03:17,950
Nothing less from that moonlight magician.

1132
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:20,699
Even I, Shinichi Kudo,

1133
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,284
find it impossible to capture...

1134
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:25,824
Oh, it's you Arthur.

1135
01:03:25,825 --> 01:03:26,949
Hello.

1136
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,324
Is your friend Sonoko all right?

1137
01:03:30,325 --> 01:03:33,033
Yup. I stopped by the hospital earlier,

1138
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:34,950
but the test results showed no problems.

1139
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:36,491
She'll be discharged this afternoon

1140
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:38,366
and head back to the hotel.

1141
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:40,074
I see. That's good.

1142
01:03:40,075 --> 01:03:42,324
Thank you for worrying about her.

1143
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:44,199
Well, let's get back to the hotel soon.

1144
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,199
I want to start packing for our trip home.

1145
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,492
Is it okay to leave them as-is right now?

1146
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,575
Yeah.

1147
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,908
I felt I should leave them alone
for a while.

1148
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:54,283
It sounded like
they were arguing about something.

1149
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:57,159
Mr. Kyogoku forfeited his match, too.

1150
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,159
Huh? Shinichi?

1151
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:03,825
ï¼ˆFOUNTAIN OF WEALTHï¼‰

1152
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:07,117
So, did you gather anything last night,
great detective?

1153
01:04:07,617 --> 01:04:10,575
This is what was in the reference material
at Rishi's place.

1154
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:17,908
According to witness testimony,

1155
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:19,283
Sherilyn wasn't stabbed

1156
01:04:19,284 --> 01:04:21,491
in the shopping mall where she collapsed.

1157
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:24,658
Instead, it was likely
inside the elevator of Tower 3.

1158
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,116
Why was it inside an elevator of all places?

1159
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:29,284
If things go bad, there's no way out.

1160
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:35,908
After getting stabbed with a plain knife,

1161
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,867
she walked all the way to the shopping mall.

1162
01:04:41,117 --> 01:04:42,367
And right after she collapsed...

1163
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:47,324
her car parked
in the underground parking lot exploded.

1164
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:50,366
That caused the entire hotel
to have a blackout.

1165
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:52,699
And thus, all security camera footage

1166
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,408
within the hotel was wiped out.

1167
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:58,324
What gets me is that Leon was at the scene.

1168
01:04:58,325 --> 01:04:59,491
Not only had he booked his own room,

1169
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:02,366
but he booked Sherilyn's room as well.

1170
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:04,324
However, when she was murdered,

1171
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:05,408
many witnesses claim

1172
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:07,908
he was riding a different elevator.

1173
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:09,741
Because his alibi was confirmed,

1174
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:12,284
he was removed from the investigation.

1175
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,783
Exactly.

1176
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,742
By the way,

1177
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:17,366
why was Leon carrying a suitcase?

1178
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:19,950
Oh, the police did go through
what was inside, of course.

1179
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,158
But it was empty.

1180
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:24,283
He had just picked up a suitcase

1181
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:26,075
he had sent out for repair.

1182
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:27,908
(delivery slip)
It's been confirmed that

1183
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:30,367
a shop near the hotel
had received such a request from him, too.

1184
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,033
So his alibi is perfect.

1185
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:35,824
There's one more thing... this.

1186
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:39,033
Why was something like this
left at the crime scene?

1187
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:41,324
Why do I need to be dragged into this?

1188
01:05:41,325 --> 01:05:44,449
There was also some effort
taken to apply viscous blood to it.

1189
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:45,325
Also...

1190
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:49,533
the culprit is trying to frame you

1191
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:51,074
for Rechel's murder as well.

1192
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:53,283
The knife used as the murder weapon
was the same type

1193
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:54,367
for Sherilyn's murder.

1194
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,991
Rechel had been placed inside that pedestal

1195
01:05:57,992 --> 01:06:00,408
before I entered the safe room.

1196
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:02,199
However, to enter the room,

1197
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,991
you need to get past all the guards

1198
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:05,908
as well as the numerous security systems.

1199
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:07,449
Someone who gets past all of the security

1200
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,200
and not even trip one of the sensors...

1201
01:06:11,284 --> 01:06:12,450
Oh, no, it's not me.

1202
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:16,075
So, the suspicious guy is Leon Lowe
after all.

1203
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:18,741
As the safe room's manager,

1204
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,742
Leon has full knowledge of
the security system.

1205
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:23,616
Furthermore, the belt was transported

1206
01:06:23,617 --> 01:06:25,533
to the stadium yesterday morning.

1207
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:27,783
And Rechel was confirmed to be alive

1208
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,824
until at least two nights ago.

1209
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:31,783
That means the crime likely occurred between

1210
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:34,325
that evening
and when the belt was transported.

1211
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,783
But for what purpose?

1212
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,449
Why was there a reason for him

1213
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:39,617
to murder his own secretary?

1214
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:42,784
Maybe the motive was that...

1215
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:47,159
(Rechel Secretary)
Rechel was trying to tell Pops something.

1216
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,533
The only clue we have
are those letters written in blood.

1217
01:06:50,534 --> 01:06:54,200
"She." Who does this "she" refer to?

1218
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,367
No good.

1219
01:07:06,368 --> 01:07:08,699
I feel like something tremendous
will happen soon,

1220
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,284
but I can't gather my thoughts.

1221
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:13,616
Even the great detective
is throwing in the towel?

1222
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:15,700
Then let's take a break for now.

1223
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:17,908
So which hand has...

1224
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,409
Your left hand has coconut water.

1225
01:07:21,034 --> 01:07:21,909
Correct.

1226
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:23,699
How did you know?

1227
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,199
You bought some earlier, didn't you?

1228
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,534
So you were watching me.

1229
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,617
Magic, huh...

1230
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:30,783
A magician is a guy

1231
01:07:30,784 --> 01:07:34,616
who makes you think
something is inside a clenched fist,

1232
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,449
and a detective is a guy
who correctly guesses

1233
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,325
what's inside before that fist is opened,
right?

1234
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,825
I get it!

1235
01:07:42,034 --> 01:07:42,784
By the way,

1236
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:46,824
is Lady Sonoko having some fight
with that karate guy?

1237
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:47,825
Apparently.

1238
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:51,783
If there's a brawl and a traffic accident
while you're traveling,

1239
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:54,159
it's no surprise
if you become emotionally unstable.

1240
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,367
So that's what it was about.

1241
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:58,658
Have Sonoko get injured

1242
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,324
to sway Kyogoku emotionally.

1243
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:04,449
The biggest obstacle for Jamaluddin
to win the tournament

1244
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,283
was Kyogoku, after all.

1245
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:07,658
I see.

1246
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,324
So, that accident
was also something Leon had set up.

1247
01:08:10,325 --> 01:08:13,491
Just like he hoped,
Kyogoku withdrew from the tournament.

1248
01:08:13,492 --> 01:08:16,783
Now the champion's belt
will no doubt go to Jamaluddin.

1249
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:17,284
In other words,

1250
01:08:17,285 --> 01:08:20,075
it will end up in the hands of his employer,
Leon.

1251
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:22,783
Right along with the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1252
01:08:22,784 --> 01:08:24,574
But why is Leon so fixated

1253
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:26,991
on the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

1254
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:29,659
I got hold of a clue that
might unravel that.

1255
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:32,824
This is the guy
who Leon was meeting around dawn.

1256
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:34,742
Can you figure out this guy's identity?

1257
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:38,034
Well, it's not an impossibility, but...

1258
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,491
You suddenly called the Professor

1259
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,449
saying you're going to Hokkaido,
and we haven't heard since!

1260
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,991
What are you doing right now?

1261
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:47,408
Sorry, Haibara.
A lot has been happening here, too.

1262
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:49,699
You guys, keep it quiet for a bit!

1263
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,908
Okay.

1264
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:51,991
Jeez. Knowing you,

1265
01:08:51,992 --> 01:08:55,074
I'm sure you're involved in some incident,
right?

1266
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:56,700
Actually, that's exactly it.

1267
01:08:57,409 --> 01:09:00,824
I just sent you some pictures that Kid took.

1268
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:03,324
Kid? Did you just say "Kid"?

1269
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:05,824
You're kidding me!
Kid the Phantom Thief appeared?

1270
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,699
You're on the phone with Conan, right?

1271
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,366
Wasn't he in Hokkaido?

1272
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:12,741
What is Kid stealing this time?

1273
01:09:12,742 --> 01:09:14,574
Maybe a wooden statue of a bear?

1274
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:16,158
Maybe some ramen in Sapporo.

1275
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,283
He'd never steal anything like that.

1276
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:19,117
Ai!

1277
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:20,824
Can I talk on the phone, too?

1278
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,117
Me, too!

1279
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,283
Sorry, the kids are over right now.

1280
01:09:26,284 --> 01:09:27,491
I-I see.

1281
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:29,658
I'll tell you all about it when I get back.

1282
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:30,699
For now, can you figure out

1283
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,909
the identity of the guy in the picture?

1284
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:35,366
Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

1285
01:09:35,367 --> 01:09:37,575
You're really all right, aren't you?

1286
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,992
Yeah, somehow.

1287
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:42,533
I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears,

1288
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:43,783
but don't be too reckless.

1289
01:09:43,784 --> 01:09:45,034
Thank you.

1290
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:47,699
That should do it.

1291
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,117
So, what will we do from here,
great detective?

1292
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:52,199
We'll see how things go.

1293
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,158
How will Leon act

1294
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:56,033
once he obtains the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

1295
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:57,617
But before that is Pops.

1296
01:09:58,325 --> 01:10:00,159
Oh, hey! Wait!

1297
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,825
The winner of Jun Han Karate

1298
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:12,867
Jamaluddin!!!

1299
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:19,284
So,

1300
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:21,117
what do you think of
my city plan?

1301
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,158
We cannot accept your proposal

1302
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,199
Why?

1303
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,366
You lose nothing with this plan

1304
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:32,742
It also benefits the country

1305
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:34,783
It's too hasty

1306
01:10:34,784 --> 01:10:37,241
If you proceed wih this much development

1307
01:10:37,242 --> 01:10:39,492
some maybe forced
ou of their home!

1308
01:10:39,742 --> 01:10:41,491
We can give them another place

1309
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:43,575
My plan is perfect!

1310
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:46,616
You are too young!

1311
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,617
Learn some more and comeback

1312
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,242
Old fool

1313
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:00,784
Your era is now at the end

1314
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,950
I will build a new city!

1315
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:18,492
Hands in the air

1316
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,117
Ok.. ok

1317
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,909
We seem to cross paths a lot.

1318
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:31,491
If this plan succeeds, we will be partners.

1319
01:11:31,492 --> 01:11:33,408
I'm counting on you.

1320
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:35,367
You took good care of me quite a bit.

1321
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,908
You saved me
when I was about to be taken away

1322
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:40,033
by the cops with suspected theft,

1323
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:43,033
and that was the first time.

1324
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:45,242
And since then, you know, various things...

1325
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,866
It was because I realized that

1326
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:49,824
you were the famous Reijiro Nakatomi.

1327
01:11:49,825 --> 01:11:51,949
The son of Juzo Nakatomi,

1328
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,033
dubbed the maritime transport king of Japan.

1329
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:56,575
Don't speak my father's name.

1330
01:11:57,742 --> 01:11:59,199
My apologies.

1331
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,491
In any case,

1332
01:12:00,492 --> 01:12:02,492
everything will change as of tonight.

1333
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,950
How about we witness that moment up close?

1334
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:09,909
Now, let's go together...

1335
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,283
to be witnesses in a page that will be

1336
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:14,909
engraved into Singapore's history.

1337
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:20,909
Sorry, Pops!

1338
01:12:22,034 --> 01:12:23,492
What's this all of a sudden?

1339
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,617
Oh, no, stop it! You perv!

1340
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:28,367
This is it!

1341
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,909
Nakatomi?

1342
01:12:32,034 --> 01:12:35,366
Nakatomi... You mean Nakatomi Shipping?

1343
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:36,200
Probably.

1344
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:38,867
Pops, I'm going to borrow this!

1345
01:12:41,742 --> 01:12:45,534
Did that brat just call me "Pops"?

1346
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:49,408
Why are you suddenly leaving Japan?

1347
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:51,616
It's a vacation. Vacation!

1348
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,116
You also went to Singapore five years ago.

1349
01:12:54,117 --> 01:12:56,074
Yeah, this trip is the first time since.

1350
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:57,533
What of it?

1351
01:12:57,534 --> 01:12:58,741
President Nakatomi is...

1352
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:01,116
It's that guy who was at Merlion Square.

1353
01:13:01,117 --> 01:13:03,575
But he got taken down by that karate guy.

1354
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:07,575
Hey, Haibara.

1355
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:10,241
You figured out who that guy was?

1356
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:11,825
Yes, barely.

1357
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:13,991
His name is Eugene Lim.

1358
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:15,908
What a surprise, he's a pirate.

1359
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:16,784
A pirate?

1360
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:20,366
He's been recently sighted near Singapore.

1361
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:21,616
As expected of you, Haibara.

1362
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:22,908
I can always count on you!

1363
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:24,824
The fact that you're flattering me means...

1364
01:13:24,825 --> 01:13:27,574
you have something else
you want me to check up on?

1365
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:28,992
Y-Yeah.

1366
01:13:30,284 --> 01:13:33,033
Have you ever heard of
the name Reijiro Nakatomi?

1367
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,283
The guy from Nakatomi Shipping.

1368
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,284
I know of him.

1369
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:38,116
I want to know the status of the ships

1370
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:39,866
that Nakatomi Shipping owns.

1371
01:13:39,867 --> 01:13:42,617
Just the ships around Singapore
would be good.

1372
01:13:46,117 --> 01:13:47,449
There are two freighter ships

1373
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,158
and a tanker near Singapore.

1374
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,699
What gets my attention

1375
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,449
is that the tanker has strayed
from the planned route.

1376
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,533
That's the one.

1377
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:57,533
Send me data for that tanker!

1378
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,908
Okay! I'll contact you again later.

1379
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:01,034
Please do!

1380
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:03,199
So, what's up with this tanker?

1381
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,909
That word "she" that Rechel left behind.

1382
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,699
They use "she" when referring to ships, too.

1383
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,784
(NAKATOMI)

1384
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
Was what you said over the phone true?

1385
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,450
Everything that's been going on
was all planned by Mr. Lowe?

1386
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:25,117
Can you explain in a way
that I can understand?

1387
01:14:25,867 --> 01:14:29,324
It all started
with the Fist of Blue Sapphire,

1388
01:14:29,325 --> 01:14:30,659
found by Zhonhan Chen.

1389
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:34,283
He embedded it into the champion's belt
for a karate tournament

1390
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:36,117
and said he'd give the belt to the winner.

1391
01:14:36,534 --> 01:14:39,116
Leon made Jamaluddin
participate in the tournament

1392
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:41,284
in an effort to obtain the jewel.

1393
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,949
However, he faced an unexpected obstacle.

1394
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,699
Someone undefeated in 400 karate matches...

1395
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,533
Makoto Kyogoku entered the tournament.

1396
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:50,991
The one who invited him

1397
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,366
was the murder victim, Sherilyn Tan.

1398
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:55,824
E-Even if that was the motive,

1399
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,991
Mr. Lowe has an alibi.

1400
01:14:57,992 --> 01:14:59,491
When she was stabbed,

1401
01:14:59,492 --> 01:15:02,116
he was riding a different elevator.

1402
01:15:02,117 --> 01:15:03,492
The truth goes like this.

1403
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:06,116
After meeting up with Leon at the poolside,

1404
01:15:06,117 --> 01:15:09,700
she boarded an elevator
to return to her room.

1405
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:13,199
However, she was staying

1406
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
on the 16th floor of Tower 3.

1407
01:15:16,075 --> 01:15:17,366
Due to how the hotel was built,

1408
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:20,659
she has to change elevators
on the 34th floor.

1409
01:15:21,534 --> 01:15:23,825
And when she was on her way
back to her room,

1410
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:26,867
she was dragged into a different room...

1411
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:29,159
by the secretary, Rechel.

1412
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,824
Rechel is an accomplice?

1413
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:32,950
It can't be...

1414
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,866
The room Leon reserved to
enter the poolside restaurant

1415
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:38,991
only for special hotel guests

1416
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,367
is on the 34th floor.

1417
01:15:42,117 --> 01:15:44,324
Leon came down to stab Sherilyn,

1418
01:15:44,325 --> 01:15:46,659
and killed her in that room.

1419
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:50,409
And placed the corpse in the suitcase.

1420
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:52,824
(TOWER 3)
Later, Rechel and Leon

1421
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:54,991
boarded separate elevators.

1422
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:56,408
I'm betting they used

1423
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:58,699
a type of magic knife for this trick.

1424
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,200
However,
the blood was that of Sherilyn herself.

1425
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:08,700
Pretending to be stabbed, Rechel collapses.

1426
01:16:10,784 --> 01:16:12,284
Moments later...

1427
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,658
Everything took place unbeknownst
to everyone during the blackout

1428
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:20,325
caused by the explosion.

1429
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,742
Th-That's impossible.

1430
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:40,949
Rechel, finding out about Leon's true plans,

1431
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,158
was planning to tell everything

1432
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,449
to Detective Mori
because it was so horrific.

1433
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,242
But then Leon caught wind of that.

1434
01:16:47,867 --> 01:16:49,616
The Rechel that showed up at the safe room

1435
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:51,367
was Kid in disguise.

1436
01:16:51,825 --> 01:16:55,325
Even Kid was used by Leon's plan.

1437
01:16:55,992 --> 01:16:58,991
The real Rechel had already been murdered

1438
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:00,825
and shoved inside that pedestal.

1439
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,408
He knew Kid would come disguised as Rechel,

1440
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:04,866
so along with having an alibi,

1441
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:06,283
he also made it look like

1442
01:17:06,284 --> 01:17:08,617
the whole incident was caused by Kid.

1443
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,866
How can he know such a thing?

1444
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,074
Then, Rishi,

1445
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:14,117
who do you think
would be a safe bet to impersonate?

1446
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:16,242
Let's see.

1447
01:17:16,243 --> 01:17:18,199
No matter how good the disguise is,

1448
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,867
it's useless
if you bump into the real person.

1449
01:17:21,117 --> 01:17:22,949
So you'd want someone whose location

1450
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,491
and time you'd know, wouldn't you?

1451
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:27,033
I see! Rechel had scheduled to meet

1452
01:17:27,034 --> 01:17:29,116
with Mr. Mori at 3:00 p.m.

1453
01:17:29,117 --> 01:17:30,075
And that's why...

1454
01:17:30,076 --> 01:17:31,949
Right. Kid impersonated someone

1455
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:34,449
who would never go to the safe room.

1456
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,241
Kid completely fell for the trap because

1457
01:17:36,242 --> 01:17:38,534
Leon predicted that's what he would do.

1458
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,159
Then tell me!

1459
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,991
What in the world is Mr. Lowe trying to do?

1460
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,450
It's all for a stupid little project of his.

1461
01:17:46,992 --> 01:17:48,533
Leon has been in contact with Eugene Lim,

1462
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:51,366
the leader of a pirate group.

1463
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,199
The word left behind on the pedestal

1464
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,159
at Rechel's murder scene was "she".

1465
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:58,158
And Rechel secretly entrusted a medal

1466
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,699
made by Nakatomi Shipping to Detective Mori.

1467
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,658
Everything involves ships.

1468
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,366
How are all of those things related?

1469
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,409
Rishi.

1470
01:18:07,075 --> 01:18:08,449
This is an analysis of

1471
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,533
the Nakatomi Shipping vessel routes
in this area

1472
01:18:10,534 --> 01:18:13,950
that Mr. Detective received from Tokyo.

1473
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,699
One tanker is greatly straying

1474
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,117
from the intended path.

1475
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:19,699
If it keeps going,

1476
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,617
its destination will be Marina Bay.

1477
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:24,533
Leon is planning to use pirates

1478
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:26,825
to ram an entire tanker into the city!

1479
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:33,116
In the first place,

1480
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:35,741
why does Mr. Lowe have to do such a thing?

1481
01:18:35,742 --> 01:18:36,617
What's the reason?

1482
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,200
I don't know
what Leon would say about this...

1483
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:43,824
but if you were to destroy this city
and rebuild it,

1484
01:18:43,825 --> 01:18:46,825
a great deal of money would be used.

1485
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,324
I think Leon was persistent
about the Fist of Blue Sapphire

1486
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,116
because he needed it
in exchange for being able

1487
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:54,158
to control the pirates.

1488
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,783
B-But...

1489
01:18:55,784 --> 01:18:57,699
pirates evade the police's view

1490
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,616
and are dispersed all over the place.

1491
01:18:59,617 --> 01:19:00,909
How did he contact them?

1492
01:19:01,492 --> 01:19:02,867
He used the Merlion.

1493
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:04,741
You remember the incident

1494
01:19:04,742 --> 01:19:06,699
where the Merlion spewed red water, right?

1495
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,366
I'm sure the pirates caught notice of it

1496
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:10,533
because it was broadcasted
all over the world.

1497
01:19:10,534 --> 01:19:12,909
I'm sure that was the sign
for the plan to start.

1498
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:14,908
But more than that, right now...

1499
01:19:14,909 --> 01:19:17,116
Yes. If we don't hurry, it'll be too late!

1500
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:18,574
Even if you say that,

1501
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:19,949
I can't do this at my own discretion.

1502
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:23,033
We need more evidence
if we're going to mobilize the police.

1503
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,408
We won't make it if we do that!

1504
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:26,033
Isn't there any other way?

1505
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:28,616
I know. We can consult
with Mr. Zhonhan Chen.

1506
01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:31,283
He has a lot of influence
with the military and the police.

1507
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:33,533
I'm sure he will help us out with this!

1508
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:34,909
Rishi, one more thing!

1509
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:36,409
What is it?

1510
01:19:36,784 --> 01:19:39,908
If things go according to plan,
and the tanker rams into the city,

1511
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:42,200
where do you think Leon will be?

1512
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:44,158
Let's see.

1513
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,158
He's a very cautious person,

1514
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,699
so I'm sure he'd be watching from afar.

1515
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,199
Perhaps he's already
left the country by now.

1516
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,659
Well, then, I've got to hurry!

1517
01:19:54,617 --> 01:19:56,950
I see. Thank you.

1518
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:07,491
Jeez, Dad, where are you?

1519
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:09,534
The show is about to begin!

1520
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,617
Shinichi has gone off somewhere as well.

1521
01:20:15,242 --> 01:20:18,742
Man, why did I get roped into this incident?

1522
01:20:19,492 --> 01:20:22,283
Was it really Leon that left my card

1523
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,950
at Sherilyn's murder scene?

1524
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:25,617
No.

1525
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,033
The card posted on the elevator was found

1526
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:31,575
quite a while
after the crime scene investigation started.

1527
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:33,784
Why do you think that happened?

1528
01:20:34,284 --> 01:20:35,409
Whoa.

1529
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:37,909
We got the newest path of the tanker.

1530
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:41,616
Wh-What?

1531
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:44,284
Oh no! If the tanker keeps going,
it'll hit the hotel!

1532
01:21:05,867 --> 01:21:08,534
Ran! Please answer the phone!

1533
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:53,034
It's heading this way.

1534
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:40,658
Hey, Ran! Are you having fun?

1535
01:22:40,659 --> 01:22:42,866
Dad, where are you right now?

1536
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:45,199
Huh? I don't know what's up,

1537
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,366
but I can see a huge boat!

1538
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,074
Wait, hey, Dad!

1539
01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:51,616
Are you at the top of the hotel?

1540
01:22:51,617 --> 01:22:53,534
Hello? Hello?

1541
01:22:58,992 --> 01:23:00,324
Can we make it?

1542
01:23:00,325 --> 01:23:01,492
I think so

1543
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,659
Sonoko! Sonoko!

1544
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:05,783
What?

1545
01:23:05,784 --> 01:23:07,574
Something seems to be happening outside.

1546
01:23:07,575 --> 01:23:09,742
I think it would be better
if we left the hotel.

1547
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,492
Hello?

1548
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:17,199
Yes, I understand.

1549
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,574
Who was that from?

1550
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:19,616
Someone from the police.

1551
01:23:19,617 --> 01:23:21,158
They told me to stay in my room

1552
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:23,158
because if I head out haphazardly,

1553
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,575
people might come after me again.

1554
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,075
Apparently someone's coming to guard me.

1555
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,824
H-However...

1556
01:23:30,825 --> 01:23:33,492
It's fine. I'll stay here.

1557
01:23:35,242 --> 01:23:36,409
I understand.

1558
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:46,825
Not good.

1559
01:23:46,826 --> 01:23:48,867
With this crowd,
we can't get close to the hotel!

1560
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:51,992
Damn, it's all or nothing!

1561
01:23:56,034 --> 01:23:57,534
Oh, it's Kid

1562
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,534
It's Kid! Kid is here!

1563
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:07,159
I got this place all to myself.

1564
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:09,325
Wh-What do you want?

1565
01:24:11,534 --> 01:24:13,867
I-It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

1566
01:24:23,075 --> 01:24:25,075
I really don't know... just about him.

1567
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:29,742
Damn it, I can't get through!

1568
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:36,742
Crap!

1569
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:47,200
Jeez! Where in the world are you, Dad?

1570
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,200
Look!

1571
01:24:59,117 --> 01:25:01,325
This city will be born again

1572
01:25:01,575 --> 01:25:03,034
with my hand!

1573
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:07,575
Why are you ...?

1574
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,367
W-Wait!

1575
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,199
This is a surprise.

1576
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,449
I didn't think you had the ability
to do this.

1577
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:27,450
Even I couldn't see this coming.

1578
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,617
Rishi.

1579
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,866
Well, now, I'll be a man and admit it.

1580
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:36,241
Yes, this was all part of my plan.

1581
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:38,491
Let's have a little chat.

1582
01:25:38,492 --> 01:25:40,659
Please put away that dangerous thing.

1583
01:25:41,742 --> 01:25:44,909
Mr. Lowe, I think you're the one
with the misunderstanding.

1584
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:48,492
Freeze!

1585
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:51,616
There is no one here!

1586
01:25:51,617 --> 01:25:53,325
We stop the ship now

1587
01:26:13,117 --> 01:26:15,574
The tanker has stopped! Kid!

1588
01:26:15,575 --> 01:26:17,116
Let's leave this to the police!

1589
01:26:17,117 --> 01:26:18,117
Yeah!

1590
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:19,783
The tanker!

1591
01:26:19,784 --> 01:26:21,117
What happened ...?

1592
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:25,075
I-I'll stay quiet! Don't shoot!

1593
01:26:26,117 --> 01:26:30,242
Help me! Don't kill me!

1594
01:26:30,992 --> 01:26:33,575
Rishi... I didn't think you'd shoot.

1595
01:26:34,117 --> 01:26:35,492
Jamaluddin!

1596
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:37,242
Wa-wait!

1597
01:26:38,117 --> 01:26:40,075
Jamaluddin! What are you thinking?

1598
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,949
The only reason
I work for you-

1599
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:44,116
was to fight against Kyogoku

1600
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:46,533
I have no such reason anymore

1601
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:47,284
What?!

1602
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:48,284
Mr. Lowe!

1603
01:26:48,742 --> 01:26:51,784
With all due respect,
have you lost your touch a bit?

1604
01:26:52,492 --> 01:26:54,784
You were not the one controlling the world.

1605
01:26:58,117 --> 01:26:59,075
It was me.

1606
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,075
It can't be... that you...

1607
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:05,284
H-Hold on! Wait!

1608
01:27:05,617 --> 01:27:07,200
I-I'll give you this!

1609
01:27:07,534 --> 01:27:09,491
The jewel is inside.

1610
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:11,117
It's a good deal, right, Rishi?

1611
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,783
Kid the Phantom Thief?

1612
01:27:25,784 --> 01:27:29,117
Wh-What is Arthur doing here?

1613
01:27:30,117 --> 01:27:31,949
Let's see, I have to change elevators
on the 34th floor

1614
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,367
to get to the roof.

1615
01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:36,449
Hey!

1616
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,367
Wait

1617
01:27:48,867 --> 01:27:49,784
Are they?

1618
01:27:49,785 --> 01:27:52,367
Heading to Marina Bay Sands?

1619
01:27:56,075 --> 01:27:57,449
What are you doing?

1620
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:58,908
I was just trying to capture

1621
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:00,908
the two masterminds of the case!

1622
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:04,241
You can stop your terrible acting now,
Rishi Ramanathan.

1623
01:28:04,242 --> 01:28:06,742
It's obvious to us that
you're the one behind it all.

1624
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:09,241
What first sparked doubt

1625
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:12,199
was Kid's advance notice
left at the crime scene.

1626
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,658
The police noticed the note

1627
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:17,074
right after you arrived at the scene,

1628
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:18,366
wasn't it, Rishi?

1629
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:19,616
And moments ago,

1630
01:28:19,617 --> 01:28:21,949
when I asked you where Leon would be,

1631
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,992
my suspicions against you became definitive.

1632
01:28:24,534 --> 01:28:25,242
What?

1633
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:28,491
Someone as conceited as Leon

1634
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:30,158
wouldn't flee overseas right before

1635
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:31,784
his project came to fruition.

1636
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,408
He's sure to be watching it all

1637
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,075
from a location with the best view.

1638
01:28:36,867 --> 01:28:39,159
There's no way
you wouldn't recognize that fact!

1639
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:41,616
This is a surprise.

1640
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:43,699
So you were testing me with that question.

1641
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,117
Everything started five years ago,

1642
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:48,617
after your father's accident.

1643
01:28:49,034 --> 01:28:51,616
The murder of an oceanographer,
and the suspect,

1644
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:53,159
previously denying charges,
now plead guilty.

1645
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:54,742
If I recall...

1646
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:57,949
it was also five years ago

1647
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:00,616
that you came to Singapore, Mr. Nakatomi.

1648
01:29:00,617 --> 01:29:02,159
N-No, I...

1649
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:04,699
Leon captured the culprit.

1650
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,241
And with Sherilyn as the defense counsel,

1651
01:29:06,242 --> 01:29:07,700
he pled guilty.

1652
01:29:08,325 --> 01:29:10,283
This can't be only a coincidence.

1653
01:29:10,284 --> 01:29:12,074
What do you mean by that?

1654
01:29:12,075 --> 01:29:14,449
It was all a trap
so they could obtain a tanker

1655
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,450
that belonged to Nakatomi Shipping.

1656
01:29:17,242 --> 01:29:18,950
Everything was set up.

1657
01:29:19,825 --> 01:29:22,659
And then, there was one more trap...

1658
01:29:24,075 --> 01:29:25,742
You noticed it, didn't you?

1659
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:29,533
I thought it was all an accident at first,
too.

1660
01:29:29,534 --> 01:29:31,991
But when I was going through
Dad's belongings,

1661
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:33,241
I realized something.

1662
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:35,324
In the middle of investigating a ruin
on the ocean floor,

1663
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:37,409
he found a sunken ship by coincidence,

1664
01:29:37,867 --> 01:29:40,366
that had a high chance of containing
the king of pirates' proof,

1665
01:29:40,367 --> 01:29:42,242
the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1666
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:45,699
That's why you killed Dad first, didn't you?

1667
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,534
So that
he wouldn't salvage the jewel before you!

1668
01:29:50,075 --> 01:29:50,909
Help!

1669
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,325
Someone push me in the back

1670
01:29:55,034 --> 01:29:56,074
Help is on the way!

1671
01:29:56,075 --> 01:29:58,199
Hurry!
Save him!!

1672
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,283
You figured that Dad,
who has a strong sense of justice,

1673
01:30:00,284 --> 01:30:02,784
would surely jump in to help.

1674
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:15,616
Wh-What's the meaning of all this, Leon?

1675
01:30:15,617 --> 01:30:16,866
You...

1676
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:17,825
Let go of me!

1677
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,699
Rishi,

1678
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,158
you have some kind of a misunderstanding.

1679
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,366
The culprit who killed your father
has gone to jail...

1680
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:28,533
Having doubts about Dad's death,

1681
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:30,366
I became one of your students,

1682
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:32,408
then a reserve police officer.

1683
01:30:32,409 --> 01:30:34,825
Then, I started to do my own research
about the incident.

1684
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,366
I first approached Sherilyn Tan,
who was the legal counsel.

1685
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,116
When I suggested we blackmail Leon

1686
01:30:40,117 --> 01:30:42,199
using incidents about Reijiro,

1687
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,241
she was very quick to tell me.

1688
01:30:44,242 --> 01:30:46,366
And Rechel... That's right.

1689
01:30:46,367 --> 01:30:47,741
Through her,

1690
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:51,034
I got every last bit of information
about you guys.

1691
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:52,992
If so,

1692
01:30:52,993 --> 01:30:55,783
why did you post an advance notice from Kid?

1693
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,492
Why don't you tell us?

1694
01:30:57,992 --> 01:30:59,741
The Fist of Blue Sapphire

1695
01:30:59,742 --> 01:31:02,325
and a murder case
that has nothing to do with him.

1696
01:31:02,992 --> 01:31:04,574
If I entice him with both,

1697
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:06,533
I was sure the Phantom Thief would show up.

1698
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,616
And by showing up,

1699
01:31:07,617 --> 01:31:09,200
he would surely get in the way of your plan.

1700
01:31:10,409 --> 01:31:13,534
I wasn't expecting that
high school detective to show up,

1701
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:16,534
but he did quite a good job
of playing his role.

1702
01:31:16,909 --> 01:31:18,033
Mr. Nakatomi...

1703
01:31:18,034 --> 01:31:20,699
I heard Leon saved you back

1704
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,491
when you were suspected of theft.

1705
01:31:22,492 --> 01:31:25,074
But was that really a coincidence?

1706
01:31:25,075 --> 01:31:26,949
Think really hard about it.

1707
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:30,242
Perhaps everything has been...

1708
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:33,242
Damn you!

1709
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:37,034
You sure did your research well, Rishi.

1710
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:44,617
Where is this? If I recall...

1711
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:46,659
Dad!

1712
01:31:51,784 --> 01:31:52,949
Ran?

1713
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,159
What?

1714
01:31:58,075 --> 01:31:59,533
Whoa, what's this?

1715
01:31:59,534 --> 01:32:00,534
Dad...

1716
01:32:03,492 --> 01:32:04,242
Ra...

1717
01:32:06,284 --> 01:32:06,909
Fall back

1718
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,034
And regroup.. Tell the chopper too..

1719
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:14,825
What's up with you guys?

1720
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,325
Now, Rishi.

1721
01:32:17,909 --> 01:32:20,075
Unfortunately for you, the tide has turned.

1722
01:32:20,825 --> 01:32:23,741
Eugene, the plan seems to have failed

1723
01:32:23,742 --> 01:32:25,449
You can take this jewel

1724
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,492
Take care of everyone here

1725
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:34,784
What are you doing?

1726
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,200
Dont move

1727
01:32:38,867 --> 01:32:39,992
H-Help me!

1728
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,074
Now that I have the jewel,

1729
01:32:42,075 --> 01:32:43,824
I have no need for you

1730
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:44,825
What?

1731
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:48,699
I have no time for your nonsense

1732
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,241
I am known to break promises

1733
01:32:51,242 --> 01:32:54,950
It just there was a more lucrative offer

1734
01:32:55,742 --> 01:32:57,450
You guys are after...

1735
01:32:59,075 --> 01:33:01,199
You're a very perceptive little boy.

1736
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,449
That's right.

1737
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:05,699
The young daughter of the Suzuki Group
is staying in this hotel.

1738
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,574
If we kidnap her,
we'll get an unimaginable amount as ransom.

1739
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:11,866
Hasn't the daughter evacuated already?

1740
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:13,824
She should still be in her suite.

1741
01:33:13,825 --> 01:33:15,241
I already told her on the phone

1742
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:17,492
to stay in her room no matter what.

1743
01:33:20,825 --> 01:33:22,658
H-Hold on, Makoto!

1744
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:23,492
Excuse me.

1745
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,659
All of the elevators have stopped.

1746
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,575
We should get out of here.

1747
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:33,200
There, come on

1748
01:33:33,992 --> 01:33:35,700
Don't shoot! You'll hit her!

1749
01:33:35,992 --> 01:33:39,159
M-Makoto, what is all of this about?

1750
01:33:45,575 --> 01:33:46,699
Look.

1751
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:50,199
In the end, everything ends up
just how I imagined it to be.

1752
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,534
This city will burn to the ground
and then be reborn!

1753
01:34:01,075 --> 01:34:03,200
You won't be around to see it though!

1754
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:08,909
What?

1755
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,534
They are going to shoot rocket
at us?

1756
01:34:29,075 --> 01:34:29,659
Damn

1757
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:34,909
Take this!

1758
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:40,450
Makoto!

1759
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:49,992
What, what, what, what, what, what?

1760
01:34:50,367 --> 01:34:51,659
Go after her!

1761
01:34:56,367 --> 01:34:58,492
They're here!

1762
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,699
What's going on here?

1763
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,450
I don't know!

1764
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:09,283
Most of the pirates are now in the hotel

1765
01:35:09,284 --> 01:35:11,074
Just what is going on inside?

1766
01:35:11,075 --> 01:35:12,366
Its dangerous..

1767
01:35:12,367 --> 01:35:13,450
Please get back

1768
01:35:43,534 --> 01:35:44,574
You okay?

1769
01:35:44,575 --> 01:35:45,867
Y-Yeah.

1770
01:35:45,992 --> 01:35:49,159
At this rate,
the city will really get destroyed!

1771
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,617
Damn it. There has to be a way.

1772
01:35:54,659 --> 01:35:57,616
If we use that, we can do it!

1773
01:35:57,617 --> 01:35:58,617
Kid!

1774
01:36:01,034 --> 01:36:02,324
Are you serious?

1775
01:36:02,325 --> 01:36:03,325
Of course!

1776
01:36:07,075 --> 01:36:08,324
That's the Kid

1777
01:36:08,325 --> 01:36:09,325
shoot him down.

1778
01:36:11,325 --> 01:36:12,616
Boss, we can't hit em!

1779
01:36:12,617 --> 01:36:13,950
He's just little bird!

1780
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:18,408
Hey, we have to do something
about those pirates

1781
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:20,492
before we go through with our plan.

1782
01:36:20,867 --> 01:36:22,949
I only got one shot left in my card gun.

1783
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,617
But we still have something left.

1784
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:31,117
A trump card
that will turn the tables for us.

1785
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,075
I see.

1786
01:36:33,534 --> 01:36:34,867
We're going in!

1787
01:36:35,575 --> 01:36:36,617
Wait!

1788
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:56,575
Makoto?

1789
01:36:59,825 --> 01:37:00,950
Get them!

1790
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,034
Stay back

1791
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:07,742
He's

1792
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,034
Mine!

1793
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:12,784
Kid!

1794
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:14,575
Take me towards the ship's bow!

1795
01:37:15,742 --> 01:37:17,200
I know that!

1796
01:37:21,867 --> 01:37:23,367
Ran, stay back.

1797
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,617
Ran!

1798
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:32,784
Go!

1799
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,491
What the heck is going on?

1800
01:37:49,492 --> 01:37:50,909
I heard Shinichi's voice.

1801
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,449
Are you okay, miss?

1802
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,699
Arthur, why are you here?

1803
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,617
Well, I got worried about you.

1804
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,367
Thank you.

1805
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:04,117
Jeez, where in the world is he?

1806
01:38:06,742 --> 01:38:08,367
I'm glad you're safe.

1807
01:38:14,534 --> 01:38:15,784
Thank you!

1808
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:20,909
Makoto!

1809
01:38:22,284 --> 01:38:23,783
Kid have the jewel,

1810
01:38:23,784 --> 01:38:25,367
can you shoot him down?

1811
01:38:25,992 --> 01:38:27,450
Okay, boss

1812
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,867
There.. Stay still

1813
01:38:36,409 --> 01:38:37,534
Take this!

1814
01:38:43,534 --> 01:38:44,617
Did it hit?

1815
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,325
We're fine, Sonoko.

1816
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:53,283
Oh no..

1817
01:38:53,284 --> 01:38:54,159
What?

1818
01:38:54,492 --> 01:38:56,324
Kid, you...

1819
01:38:56,325 --> 01:38:57,449
Hi

1820
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,450
Wait

1821
01:39:05,659 --> 01:39:07,533
Help me mom!

1822
01:39:07,534 --> 01:39:09,450
Falling down!

1823
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:12,492
Makoto, you're bleeding.

1824
01:39:13,325 --> 01:39:14,867
Sonoko, if you'll excuse me.

1825
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,074
Wait, what in the world are you doing?

1826
01:39:18,075 --> 01:39:20,866
Makoto, what are you up to
in a place like this?

1827
01:39:20,867 --> 01:39:22,409
You can't!

1828
01:39:26,117 --> 01:39:27,949
This is a piggyback carrier knot.

1829
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,158
Sonoko,

1830
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:32,825
this time please do not stray away from me!

1831
01:39:34,534 --> 01:39:35,325
In this situation,

1832
01:39:35,326 --> 01:39:38,159
I can't stay away even if I wanted to.

1833
01:40:21,742 --> 01:40:23,075
Where is he!?

1834
01:40:51,492 --> 01:40:54,409
Mr. Kyogoku, grab onto something!

1835
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:12,909
No!

1836
01:41:37,784 --> 01:41:39,242
Are you alright?

1837
01:41:49,825 --> 01:41:50,950
You can have it back.

1838
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:54,366
Since that wasn't the jewel

1839
01:41:54,367 --> 01:41:57,075
I was looking for.

1840
01:42:05,784 --> 01:42:09,200
Sonoko, please sit over here for a minute.

1841
01:42:09,867 --> 01:42:11,283
I apologize.

1842
01:42:11,284 --> 01:42:13,867
I think I tied the knots a bit too tightly.

1843
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,534
There, all untied now.

1844
01:42:22,492 --> 01:42:24,492
N-No, this is... well...

1845
01:42:25,242 --> 01:42:27,783
somewhat of a good luck charm for me.

1846
01:42:27,784 --> 01:42:29,950
You kept this on all this time?

1847
01:42:30,825 --> 01:42:31,949
Y-Yes.

1848
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,866
I thought it would be disreputable as a man,

1849
01:42:33,867 --> 01:42:35,575
so I couldn't tell you.

1850
01:42:36,367 --> 01:42:37,783
So that's it.

1851
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:40,616
I thought I was the one
being protected all this time,

1852
01:42:40,617 --> 01:42:43,409
but instead I was the one protecting Makoto.

1853
01:42:51,242 --> 01:42:52,699
I see, I see!

1854
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,408
Please give me back that Band-Aid.

1855
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,367
No way!

1856
01:42:55,368 --> 01:42:56,616
Please!

1857
01:42:56,617 --> 01:42:58,366
I'm going to treasure this forever!

1858
01:42:58,367 --> 01:42:59,784
So lovey-dovey.

1859
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,034
Who in the world are you, exactly?

1860
01:43:11,742 --> 01:43:13,825
You're not just an ordinary kid, are you?

1861
01:43:15,909 --> 01:43:18,575
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

1862
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,617
But are you sure?

1863
01:47:13,784 --> 01:47:15,491
Letting that strong boyfriend

1864
01:47:15,492 --> 01:47:17,533
head to the United States again...

1865
01:47:17,534 --> 01:47:18,617
It's fine, it's fine.

1866
01:47:18,992 --> 01:47:20,324
After all,

1867
01:47:20,325 --> 01:47:22,159
Makoto should be fighting someone,
somewhere!

1868
01:47:23,742 --> 01:47:25,783
Oh, here they come.

1869
01:47:25,784 --> 01:47:27,241
Hey, what's that?

1870
01:47:27,242 --> 01:47:29,866
Hey, don't get so close to me like that.

1871
01:47:29,867 --> 01:47:31,241
It's hard for me to walk.

1872
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:32,366
No way.

1873
01:47:32,367 --> 01:47:34,324
I'm not going to let you go ever again.

1874
01:47:34,325 --> 01:47:35,284
Really?

1875
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,492
I've been waiting so long...

1876
01:47:39,742 --> 01:47:41,034
for this very moment.

1877
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:44,366
Kid! I've been waiting for you!

1878
01:47:44,367 --> 01:47:45,866
Seriously?

1879
01:47:45,867 --> 01:47:47,449
I knew from the very beginning

1880
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:49,366
that you weren't Shinichi!

1881
01:47:49,367 --> 01:47:50,491
Because Shinichi...

1882
01:47:50,492 --> 01:47:53,283
- What's up?
- ...never calls Dad "Pops," ever!

1883
01:47:53,284 --> 01:47:55,200
But he always...

1884
01:47:56,034 --> 01:47:57,449
Come to think of it,

1885
01:47:57,450 --> 01:47:59,658
I've never said "Pops" in front of Ran.

1886
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:00,659
I can't forgive you

1887
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,783
for disguising as Shinichi not only once,
but twice!

1888
01:48:02,784 --> 01:48:03,450
Miss,

1889
01:48:03,451 --> 01:48:05,575
please make sure to not let go of that arm!

1890
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,450
Get him!

1891
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,783
Kid! Arrest him!

1892
01:48:13,784 --> 01:48:15,950
I'm never letting go!

1893
01:48:16,575 --> 01:48:17,700
Don't let him get away!

1894
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:20,034
Professor.

1895
01:48:26,784 --> 01:48:28,242
He's not here!

1896
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,283
Jeez! He got away!

1897
01:48:33,284 --> 01:48:34,449
Damn it!

1898
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:36,366
He should still be somewhere around here!

1899
01:48:36,367 --> 01:48:37,909
After him!

1900
01:48:43,117 --> 01:48:44,783
Conan!

1901
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,992
Welcome back, Ran.

1902
01:48:48,242 --> 01:48:49,242
I'm back.

1903
01:48:50,659 --> 01:48:52,242
You weren't lonely, were you?

1904
01:48:53,075 --> 01:48:56,575
Idiot... I was with you the whole time.
