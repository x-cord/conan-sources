1
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,542
(Yasuko Kawabe)

2
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,708
Yasuko Kawabe...

3
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,875
if you're going to hate anybody
hate that talent of yours...

4
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,417
All is for the sake of a quiet night...

5
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,875
(Full Score of Fear)

6
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,542
I'm Shinichi Kudos a high school detective.

7
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,083
I went to have fun
at an amusement park with Ran,

8
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,000
who is a childhood friend
as well as my classmate.

9
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,750
I happened to witness

10
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,375
the suspicious transaction site
of men in black.

11
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,417
Since I was absorbed
in watching the transaction

12
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,625
I didn't notice the other guy,
one of the members coming at me from behind.

13
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,958
I was forced to drink a drug by that man

14
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,333
and when I woke up...

15
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,167
I found that my body had shrunk!

16
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,250
If they find out that Shinichi Kudos is alive

17
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,625
they'll come after me again

18
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,792
and I would be endangering
the lives of those around me.

19
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,208
Therefore, taking Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to hide my true identity.

20
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,625
When Ran asked me for my name,

21
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,625
I told her that it was Conan Edogawa
on the spur of the moment.

22
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
In order to get information on those guys

23
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,375
I decided to free-load at Ran's house
being that her father is a detective...

24
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,000
Here goes Mitsuhiko!

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,833
Leave it to me!

26
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay... There!

27
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,792
Mitsuhiko!

28
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,167
Conan!

29
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:22,917
There it goes, Ayumi!

30
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,833
M,me?!

31
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,958
Leave it to me, Ayumi!

32
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,958
All right!

33
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:47,625
They're my present classmates Genta,
Ayumi and Mitsuhiko...

34
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,792
They organize a thing
called the Youth Detective Squad

35
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,125
and make me a member without
even asking me if I want to join them...

36
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,458
There's another member with us...

37
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,875
Her name is Ai Haibara...

38
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,000
Her real name is Shiho Miyano...

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,542
Since her parents were scientists working

40
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,917
for the Black Organization she was young,

41
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,375
she used to work for them
under the code name Sherry

42
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,583
and discovered the drug Apotoxin 4869...

43
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,167
But, her one and only older sister
was killed by those guys

44
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,667
and so she resisted them.

45
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
She decides to take her own life

46
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,292
and drinks the drug.

47
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,250
But only her body shrinks...

48
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,042
This is how we met each other

49
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:39,083
and end up living our lives as 1st graders
at an elementary school,

50
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,667
while pursuing the identity
of the men in black...

51
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,542
But, this little detective here

52
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,917
just can't help forgetting
his present situation

53
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,833
and makes brilliant deductions

54
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,250
using Dr. Agasa's inventions

55
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,750
To solve one difficult case
after the other...

56
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,500
Thanks to him, I'm always cold sweating...

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,250
Well, in music class

58
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,208
I'm cold sweating for different reasons
when it comes to him though...

59
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,333
You know, the usual...

60
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,833
A child with the I.Q. of an adult,

61
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,208
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan!

62
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,417
He sees through the one and only truth!

63
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
Kazuki Domoto?

64
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,208
You know him, don't you, Shinichi?

65
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,917
Yeah. He's the founder of the Music Academy

66
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,167
that was bombed last week, right?

67
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,167
I mean... I'm here at right now...

68
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Although Mr. Domoto was a famous pianist,

69
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,208
he suddenly switched to playing the organ.

70
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,208
You see... And in order to make his new hall

71
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,458
he brought a pipe organ that he found

72
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
at an old church in Germany over here...

73
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,292
Yeah, one that Bach was said
to have actually played.

74
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,500
That's the one, isn't it...

75
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,792
We get to go to

76
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:06,083
the opening of the new Domoto Hall, you see!

77
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,125
On top of that, thanks to Sonoko

78
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,000
we get to go see the rehearsal too.

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come to think of it,

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,875
Suzuki Construction Company built that hall,
didn't they?

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,708
They key of the piano...

82
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,000
It flew all the way here...

83
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go, Shinichi!

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,083
You get to hear that
Stradivarius live you know!

85
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,000
You were saying that
since you play the violin too,

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,417
you wanted to hear the real thing once,
didn't you?

87
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,708
What's he doing...

88
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,208
Hey! Are you listening or what?!

89
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,750
Sorry, sorry,

90
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,750
I happen to be busy investigating a case
right now you see...

91
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,792
Can't you even take a little time off?

92
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,333
The rehearsal's the day after tomorrow...

93
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,208
Too bad,
I guess I'll have to pass it up this time...

94
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,250
The concert's next week Tuesday...

95
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,708
Can't do...

96
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,208
I'm in the middle of an investigation...

97
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,000
But, maybe you'll finished by then.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,875
I'll have Sonoko hold a seat for you too,
just in case...

99
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,542
I'm telling you that there's no need to...

100
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,458
Keep out of my business...

101
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,250
Keep out of your business?

102
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,792
Oh, well...

103
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,083
Oh yes! I guess so!

104
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm just a busy body whose
only talent is doing Karate!

105
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,667
I didn't say that...

106
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,625
All's well. You could never be Holmes,

107
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,500
Shinichi,
not even if you listened to Stardivari.

108
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,792
What?!

109
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:47,333
I mean... you're tone deaf too.

110
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,458
Ran, how dare you...

111
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,542
Well, keep up your good work, then!

112
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,500
Mr. tone-deaf detective!

113
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,292
Heck! I'm never going to invite
that deduction freak ever again!

114
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,375
Shoots...

115
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,917
Hello...

116
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,917
Oh, Conan?
What would you like for dinner tonight?

117
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,375
Oh, uh...

118
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,167
Would curry be all right?
Or would you rather have...

119
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh, yep, curry's fine...

120
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,875
Great... You're really so easy
to get along with, Conan.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Okay, then be careful and come home
before it gets dark.

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Okay.

123
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,625
Bye Bye.

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,792
I can be pretty easy
to get along as Conan and yet...

125
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:27,042
(Kazuki Domoto, Pipe Organist and Composer)

126
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,542
Splendid! Excellent, Mr. Domoto?!

127
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,375
Mr. Domoto, you were really fantastic.

128
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,375
It's got an attractive touch
that's different from that of the piano...

129
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,417
Just as would be expected of Kazuki Domoto.

130
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,833
It sure was a fantastic performance...

131
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,208
I've seen him on TV...

132
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,958
See, that person with the glasses...

133
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,167
Oh, Mr. Takumi Fuwa...

134
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,667
He's been Mr. Domoto's exclusive piano tuner
for 35 years and...

135
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,625
has become the building head
of the Domoto Hall this time.

136
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,708
He...

137
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,167
The German man who
just turned to look is Mr. Hans Muller...

138
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,625
A pipe organ tuner...

139
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,625
Although he looks cheerful. like that now,

140
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,333
it seems that he really had it out
with Mr. Domoto before...

141
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,542
The one who's interpreting on the side,

142
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,375
is Mr. Domoto's son Genya a pianist.

143
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,708
He's the one in charge of this performance...

144
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,708
And see, those two women over there...

145
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,917
They're Mr. Domoto's disciples...

146
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,500
The one on the right is,
soprano singer Ms. Lala Chigusa

147
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,958
of Mr. Domoto's Academy's 9th class...

148
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,167
The nervous looking one beside her

149
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,042
is a student of the 8th class
of the same academy,

150
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,667
violinist Ms. Shion Yamane...

151
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,708
Oh, the substitute for Ms. Yasuko Kawabe

152
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,333
who got hurt in that explosion accident...

153
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,292
Yes, right.

154
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,917
It just so happened that during the accident,

155
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,792
Ms. Kawabe's Stradivarius was out for tuning
and safe,

156
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,833
so it turned out that Shion would borrow it
and do the performance...

157
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,125
And, the one sitting in the front most row
of the audience is...

158
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,958
Ms. Reiko Akiba, right? A soprano singer...

159
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,375
So you know her after all...

160
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,083
After all, she's famous...

161
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,250
(Reiko Akiba, soprano singer)

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,292
Shion, get ready!

163
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,083
Oh, yes sir?!

164
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,375
From the first piece, Ave Maria.

165
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,417
Yes sir...

166
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,333
I see she's still not ready
to practice with me yet...

167
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,417
Yeah, I'm sorry, but will you wait a while.

168
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,583
I, I'm sorry...

169
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,417
We finally get to listen to
Stradivarius live, don't we?

170
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,417
Ms. Sato!

171
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,958
As for me, I prefer Amati...

172
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,042
Please be quiet!

173
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,375
No, no, no!

174
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,625
Not good at all!

175
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,917
What have you been doing this past week!

176
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,833
I'm sorry...

177
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,667
Huh? Was anything wrong?

178
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,708
No... it sounded perfect...

179
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,167
No...

180
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,292
A Stradivarius sounds louder...

181
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,750
Once more, from the top!

182
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,958
Yes, sir!

183
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,875
What is it? What's up?!

184
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,292
It looks like the string
of the violin snapped...

185
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:40,042
I'm sorry, I'll change the string right away!

186
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,333
How's the balance of the sound?

187
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,750
Hmm, no problem I guess...

188
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:46,983
Oh boy...

189
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,708
I wonder if I'll even get to sing today...

190
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,500
Ms. Soma, may I have a moment with you...

191
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,125
Would you at least let me go to the restroom?

192
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,708
Mr. Mouri...

193
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,292
Do you have any clue as to who the bomber is?

194
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,208
No, not yet.

195
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,208
Was a plastic bomb used after all...?

196
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,125
Yeah... The timer was found too.

197
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,583
It seems to have been set to go off
at the time the two were going to perform...

198
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,417
Which means that this is...

199
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,958
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

200
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,500
I can't tell you the details
of the incident just yet...

201
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,875
Especially not in front of a child...

202
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,542
A child...?

203
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:40,000
You go play over
where the other children are!

204
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,250
Alright.

205
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,917
Wow! It's huge!

206
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,625
It's not only big, it's beautiful!

207
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,083
Fantastic, isn't it?

208
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,917
Um, how does sound come out of a pipe organ?

209
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,583
In principle,

210
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,208
it works in the same way as
when you play the recorder in school.

211
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,542
See all the pipes that are line in rows?

212
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,542
Air is blown in to each of the pipes

213
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,083
like you would when playing the recorder

214
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,375
and sound is produced.

215
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,083
Air?

216
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,208
But the pipes don't have holes
like those on a recorder...

217
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,542
Right, on a recorder you press on the hole

218
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:18,458
to produce different sounds,

219
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
but in a pipe organ...

220
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,833
when you push the key,

221
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,917
the pipe that corresponds with
that key produces sound...

222
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:31,042
Each pipe can only produce one sound.

223
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,208
What's that thing that looks like a switch?

224
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,583
This? This is called a stop knob,

225
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,000
and when you pull this out,

226
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
they each produce a different tone...

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,542
For example... if you pull this...

228
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,958
It's a trumpet!

229
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,750
It's a flute!

230
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,042
... Organ performers combine these sounds

231
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,083
and produce sound variations
in their performance.

232
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,917
I see, I really learned a lot!

233
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,208
And, now, for the quiz that
you've all been waiting for.

234
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,917
We haven't been waiting for it...

235
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,208
A certain opera singer hurt his throat

236
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,708
and was waiting to get operated on,

237
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,917
he decided not to have surgery

238
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,750
and recovered with the pill
that his grandfather had...

239
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,625
Now, who was this opera singer?

240
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,333
1. Soprano...

241
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,167
2. Alto...

242
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,333
3. Tenor...

243
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,833
4. Bass...

244
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,333
This is a tough one...

245
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,417
A hint, Doc?

246
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,292
What's another way of saying surgery?

247
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,708
Operation...

248
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,208
or "Ope" in short...

249
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:51,500
And... It was his grandfather's pill, right?

250
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,917
Conan, do you know the answer?

251
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah... easy...

252
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,042
-First...
-Number 1...

253
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,458
The answer is soprano singer number 1...

254
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,458
Since the opera singer
didn't have the operation,

255
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,750
you subtract "op" from "opera".

256
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,625
A pill is a little round pellet...

257
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,250
A pill from grandfather means you add a
circle to the word "grandfather"

258
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,292
Combine everything...

259
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,542
Ra...

260
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,917
Sopra...

261
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,750
no...

262
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,417
Soprano!

263
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,625
Silly...

264
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:34,375
Correct...
But, how rude to call it silly...

265
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,542
Excuse me, Ms. Akiba...

266
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,292
Will you spare me some time...

267
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:42,250
Really...
I hope it's not going to take long...

268
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,208
I would like you to tell me once more
about the e-mail

269
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:52,083
that Ms. Yasuko Kawabe sent you
just before the bombing...

270
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,958
I can't perform with amateurs
that can't tell the difference in sound.

271
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,250
Please explain what this e-mail means...

272
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,375
What meaning?
It's just what it says, isn't it?

273
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,875
Like I told you before, Ms. Kawabe and I...

274
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,958
Met for the first time

275
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,542
at the press conference
of this performance, was it?

276
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,875
Yes, and at that time

277
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,125
she said that she was going to listen to

278
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,542
the performance of
the two people that passed away,

279
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,750
so that she would mail me
what she thought of them later...

280
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,125
In other words, the sound of the two

281
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,000
and the sound that Ms. Kawabe creates is...

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,083
Did she mean that
she didn't want to perform with them,

283
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,000
because they couldn't tell what kind of sound

284
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,375
she wanted to express as a musician?

285
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,500
I guess so...

286
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,458
Why don't you go ask her in person?

287
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,167
I heard she already regained consciousness...

288
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,208
She did regain consciousness,

289
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,958
but maybe because of shock
from the explosion,

290
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,458
she seems to have amnesia of
before and after the incident.

291
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,542
Oh?

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,875
Another thing...
This was found at the scene of the crime...

293
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,250
The body of a flute...

294
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,458
Yes,

295
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,583
the flute can be divided into the head,
body and leg part.

296
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,750
And, the body part was found.

297
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,208
It could be that a student forgot it
or something but...

298
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,375
Only the body part being found bothers me...

299
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,208
Is there anything you can remember about it?

300
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,333
Ms. Akiba?

301
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,083
No, I don't!

302
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,458
Okay, I guess that's all!

303
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,417
Hey, Ms. Akiba?!

304
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:30,875
What's that?

305
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,083
What're you drinking?

306
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,958
Tea...

307
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,958
Will you give me some too?

308
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,667
No!

309
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,042
Stingy!

310
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:41,458
Is there something good in it
for your throat or something_

311
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,167
It's none of your business, is it?

312
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,583
If it's really so,

313
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,708
maybe we'll get first place
at the singing contest!

314
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,958
Singing contest?

315
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:53,208
Yes... We're going to have
a singing contest against other classes...

316
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,958
That's right!
Will you please be our singing instructor?

317
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:02,917
We're scheduled to start singing practice
from 2:00 tomorrow!

318
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:06,125
Ran's going to play the piano for us.

319
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,208
But, the problem is the one who's
going to be teaching us how to sing...

320
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,958
Hey, brats!

321
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,417
Just who are you referring to as a problem?

322
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,625
-Just what problem do you think I have?
-I'm sorry, please don't let them bother you.

323
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,417
Don't tell me that you're referring
to the 9th Symphony.

324
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,625
I hate it...

325
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,458
I don't know about the symphony part,

326
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,667
but it's Teitan Elementary's school song!

327
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:37,208
Huh? She's talking about
Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

328
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,750
Oh? Is that right...

329
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,625
Okay. I'll be your singing instructor.

330
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,542
After all I used to go
to Teitan Elementary myself too...

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,750
Oh, is that right?

332
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,208
So, just go on home for now, will you.
You're interrupting me!

333
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,958
Yes, ma'am...

334
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,083
I'm happy that she agreed
to be our singing instructor, but...

335
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,417
She sure is a snob, that lady...

336
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,042
Yes, a little, I guess...

337
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,708
A typical "Queen" type person, I guess...

338
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,750
Yeah, she kind of resembles you...

339
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,667
Oh, no, well, she's beautiful, you see...

340
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,917
It's hard to tell
whether Ms. Soma's nice or mean...

341
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,417
Yeah, but maybe she...

342
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,708
was only asking us to leave

343
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,875
because she was concerned
about Shion who was nervous.

344
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,292
Huh? I think you're thinking too hard.

345
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,583
I wonder...

346
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,250
Love13

347
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,792
Oh come on! Don't get all that serious.
I'm just an amateur, you know...

348
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,042
Lions run at top speed
even when going after rabbits, you know...

349
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:15,583
Yes, yes,
I'm no more than a rabbit to you after all...

350
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,375
That's right!
Let's play mixed doubles next time.

351
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,625
And, invite Makoto and Shinichi
to play with us.

352
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,250
Shinichi?...

353
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,500
That deduction freak...

354
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,542
No...

355
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,250
Oh, so you had it out with Shinichi...

356
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,750
I guess it's best not to get involved
in a married couple's quarrel...

357
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,542
It's nothing like that!

358
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,792
I mean, you guys are amazing...

359
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:02,667
You're always fighting and making up...

360
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,250
Oh... but, it sure was long back then

361
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,375
I think you didn't talk to him
for a week or so?

362
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,875
When was that?

363
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,500
Remember? When we just became 8th grade...

364
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,333
Oh, I remember!

365
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,708
Back then...

366
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,208
Huh? I wonder
what we were fighting over then...

367
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,667
Then, how'd you make up?

368
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,542
You don't remember
why you fought or how you made up?!

369
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,542
But, let's see...

370
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,333
Stop! Stop! Hold it!

371
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,083
I mean, you're fighting and
you're going home together side by side?

372
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,375
But we live in the same direction.

373
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Never mind... Go on...

374
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:56,500
Then... I heard a song...

375
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:00,375
Back then, I heard a song
from the direction of the river.

376
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,625
And while listening to the song
I just sort of mellowed out...

377
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,917
You made up...

378
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,708
And, what was the song?

379
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,042
I wonder what it was... that song?

380
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,708
I think it was a famous song though...

381
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,250
But...

382
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,167
It sure was a song that came sinking
deep into my heart.

383
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,375
"From green and prosperous hills"

384
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:32,500
"A distant echo sounded"

385
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,542
"Singing with a smile"

386
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,375
"Engrave the scorching sunshine"

387
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,375
"in our hearts"

388
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:48,375
"Tightly grasp the future"

389
00:26:48,375 --> 00:27:04,833
"Teitan, Teitan, Teitan elementary"

390
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,500
How did the children do?

391
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,417
Well...

392
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,042
First of all, You!

393
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,875
Your voice is too loud.

394
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,083
Match your volume to everyone else!

395
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,000
And, Mr. Freckles that's next to him!

396
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,042
You're right on key
but your heart drifts away at times.

397
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:38,000
Are you dazzled by the profile of the girl
that's standing diagonally in front of you?

398
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,625
Diagonally in front...

399
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,625
It's Ai.

400
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,875
And, you, young lady

401
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,125
Is good at singing but...

402
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,292
sing more like a child, will you.

403
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:52,292
I'm not a child.

404
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,000
Hey, hey.
You're right on key and energetic too.

405
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,417
Very good

406
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,042
Don't be distracted by the voices
around you.

407
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:05,417
-You should be more confident.
-She really is something though.

408
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,042
Although she doesn't look like
she's listening at all,

409
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,417
she's listening to each and everyone's voice.

410
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:12,250
Yeah, she's got the ear of a musician.

411
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,708
The problem is...

412
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,625
You!

413
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,792
Huh? Oh... yes!

414
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,333
You're off key from beginning to end!

415
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,917
I hope you're not doing it on purpose?

416
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,458
Oh... N... no...

417
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,917
He's not doing it on purpose!

418
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,958
Conan is just tone-deaf!

419
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,708
I thought you were standing up for me

420
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,167
What a bummer. The piano's not right either.

421
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,333
The sound is all low in general...

422
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,542
I don't think the piano's been
tuned as it should be.

423
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:39,833
Really?

424
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,958
I didn't notice.

425
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:44,375
I thought so too...

426
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,833
She's...

427
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,208
Ms. Akiba, do you have perfect pitch?

428
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,458
Yes, I do.

429
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,042
What... does perfect pitch mean?

430
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,042
It's an ability in which,
the instant you hear a sound,

431
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,583
you know what note it is and

432
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,458
how it sounds

433
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,708
For example...

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,792
E5. Mi.

435
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,958
B3 and F5. Ti and Fa!

436
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:14,917
She's right.

437
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,125
Wow.

438
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,458
That's why she's such a good singer.

439
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,417
I wonder about that.

440
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:23,292
I can't really say that
perfect pitch is something

441
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,875
that is absolutely necessary for a musician.

442
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,875
I was this way to begin with,

443
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,708
but I've heard that
you can do the same with practice.

444
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,208
If I remember correctly,
I think that piano tuner Mr. Fuwa

445
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,875
practiced his way to where he is now?

446
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,500
Well, this is as far as I can teach you.

447
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,625
It's up to you to practice and complete
what you have to do from here.

448
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:43,833
I'll come listen to you again
when you get to be much better than now.

449
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,792
What?!

450
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,583
Are you leaving?

451
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,417
I wish you'd show us an example of
how to sing before you go

452
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,750
I agree!

453
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,125
How much will you pay me?

454
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,500
Professionals don't sing unless you pay them.

455
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Bye.

456
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,250
This is the one.

457
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,683
Hey, that's my tea!

458
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,458
Thank you!

459
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,667
What's the matter, Genta!

460
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,125
My throat... My throat

461
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,458
Genta! Genta!

462
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,458
Are you all right, Genta

463
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:26,333
Somebody... put
something in there,

464
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,792
isn't that right...?

465
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,042
R... Ridiculous,

466
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,375
it couldn't be...

467
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,500
Let's take him to the
hospital right away!

468
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,542
I wonder if Genta's
going to be okay...

469
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,958
He did look like he
was really suffering.

470
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,792
His eyes were all red.

471
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,917
When did you
last drink that tea?

472
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,625
Huh... I think it was before noon.

473
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,625
Where?

474
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,458
At the Domoto Academy...

475
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,500
I rented a lesson room and
... practiced singing...

476
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,625
I went to the restroom before leaving...

477
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,417
During that time,
I left this bottle in the lesson room

478
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,792
with all my other things...

479
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,542
If someone put something inside,

480
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,125
it had to be at that time, then.

481
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,042
But, who?

482
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,583
Thank you very much.

483
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,458
Genta!

484
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,583
Are you all right?

485
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,708
I... I'm not okay...

486
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,583
What did the doctor say?

487
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:23,250
Yeah, he said that although Genta's throat
is pretty swollen,

488
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,000
he thinks that he'll recover in 4 to 5 days.

489
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,250
So , he's going to get better.

490
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,375
I'm glad

491
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,333
But,

492
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,250
it means that he won't be able to
use his voice for 4 days.

493
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,417
Yeah... It's only 3 days more
to the performance at Domoto Hall.

494
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,167
If Reiko had drunk it,

495
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,208
she may have not been able to perform.

496
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,958
Let's tell Inspector Megure about it,

497
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,750
and have him check
the contents of the bottle.

498
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,708
Okay, I'll take it to him.

499
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,583
Oh, but before that.

500
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:53,083
We'll take Genta home!

501
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:53,875
Me too.

502
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,417
I'll go too!

503
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:58,000
I've got to go see his parents

504
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,292
and tell them that he drank
somebody else's thing without permission

505
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,292
and would like to give them
a piece of my mind

506
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,417
as to the way they brought him up!

507
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,708
Sorry.

508
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,375
Genta...

509
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,792
Cheer up, Genta.

510
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,042
Four days will go by in a jiffy.

511
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:24,958
I want grandpa's pill... too...?

512
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,708
Really...
it's turning out to be like Doc's quiz.

513
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,833
Everybody, move to the side!

514
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,500
No!

515
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,625
Run for it!

516
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,500
Hurry!

517
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,917
Darn... I can't see the driver's face!

518
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,958
Right! Turn right!

519
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,708
What the...!

520
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,750
Are you all right!

521
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,042
Darn...

522
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,750
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

523
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,875
What's with that truck,

524
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,542
going the wrong way on a one-way street.

525
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,000
Reiko...

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,458
Oh, your leg is bleeding.

527
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,292
Phooey, this is nothing.

528
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:01,208
Did it decide not to attack
because the cab came along?

529
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,167
Or.

530
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,417
Okay, then sorry,
but I'll leave the children to you.

531
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,708
I'm going home with this cab,

532
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,208
so will you please
tell the police what happened?

533
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,958
I mean... are you leaving?

534
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,250
Nothing good has happened so far staying
with you people.

535
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,708
Is that so...

536
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,250
That's not nice...

537
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,917
Inspector!

538
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,958
What was the cause of the explosion?

539
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:23,698
Yes.

540
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,750
It seems that the propane gas
inside the room was leaking

541
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,500
and a lighted match ignited it.

542
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,083
Only there are traces of the gas detector
having been destroyed beforehand.

543
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,667
Then, it wasn't an accident,
but rather, homicide...

544
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:40,375
The victim was the owner of this shop,
Mr. Osamu Shida, age 36.

545
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,542
Mr. Shida is a violinist

546
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,125
and belonged to the first class
at the Domoto Academy.

547
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,875
He was a student of the first class?

548
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,375
The same as
the two previous explosion victims.

549
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,792
It sure doesn't seem to be a coincidence...

550
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,500
No, it's no coincidence!

551
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,125
Officer Sato...

552
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,000
I found this in the store...

553
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,625
What's this?

554
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,917
The leg part of a flute...

555
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,708
No doubt about it,

556
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:08,250
it's a serial killing committed
by the same person.

557
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:12,083
Moreover, the killer left a message behind...

558
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,292
The body part and the leg part...

559
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
The head part is still not found.

560
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:22,125
The culprit is going to commit
another murder...

561
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,542
About Mr. Hisao Sone who drowned to death ...

562
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:03,292
after crashing while he was flying
the para-glider yesterday...

563
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,958
Oh... I heard that he was a viola player...

564
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,958
The fact was, it turned out

565
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,875
he was a student
in the first class at Domoto Academy...

566
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,417
Then, don't tell me that.

567
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,292
Yes...

568
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:17,000
Mr. Mizuguchi and Mr. Renjo
who died the day before yesterday,

569
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
as well as Mr. Shida and his classmate who
died of the explosion...

570
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:26,208
They were all members of
a piano quartet until 2 years ago.

571
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,417
So. it's a serial murder case committed
by the same person after all...

572
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,083
Most probably...

573
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,583
According to the prefectural police,
traces tiny slashes made with a knife

574
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:40,792
were found on the cloth wings... and canopy.

575
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:45,167
And above all,
from under the seat of Mr. Sone's car...

576
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,542
The remaining part of the flute...
the head part was found, right?

577
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,875
But, now that the parts
of the flutes were all found,

578
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:58,208
I reckon it means that
the serial killings have ended.

579
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,250
I sure hope so...

580
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,167
And. Ran...

581
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,208
Yes, sir...

582
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,583
About the contents of the thermos
that you wanted me to check on...

583
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,500
The result of forensic investigation,

584
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,708
a very strong drug was found mixed
into the drink...

585
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,125
It's obviously too serious a crime
to be taken as just a prank...

586
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,375
What about the truck that attacked us?

587
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,625
It was a truck that
was stolen near the scene of the crime...

588
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,542
In other words,

589
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,625
the culprit tried to hurt Ms. Akiba

590
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:26,750
and drugged her drink, but failed,

591
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,375
So next,
tried attacking her with a stolen truck,

592
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,083
to carry out the original purpose.

593
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:39,000
The purpose of
keeping Mr. Aikba from performing

594
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,833
at the opening of the Domoto Hall...

595
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:45,500
Uh, if Reiko can't perform,

596
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,583
who's going to be her substitute?

597
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,917
Most probably Lala Chigusa...

598
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,458
The number one candidate to sing
the soprano part for the event was she,

599
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,417
who belonged to
the 9th class of the Domoto Academy,

600
00:38:58,417 --> 00:38:59,875
as well as being his student.

601
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,500
But Ms. Yasuko Kawabe,

602
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,167
who was already chosen to perform,
recommended Ms. Akiba that

603
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,833
she had always wanted to sing with,

604
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:11,583
despite never having seen her
in person before.

605
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,833
That's seems to be
how Ms. Akiba ended up being here...

606
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,250
The next problem is the connection

607
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,000
of the foursome with the case.

608
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,875
For now, no connection between Ms. Akiba
and the foursome has been found...

609
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,125
The only thing we've found so far is

610
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,750
the connection between the first two people

611
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,125
who died of the explosion and Ms. Kawabe.

612
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,917
I guess it's about them being scheduled
to perform together, eh...

613
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,292
The bomb was set under the floor

614
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:38,292
where the two that
died of the explosion were.

615
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,833
Which means

616
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,458
that Ms. Kawabe unfortunately got involved...

617
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,292
We can't be all too sure.

618
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:50,000
So long as there is someone whose motive
is to hurt Ms. Kawabe is around...

619
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,792
Are you referring to the candidate,
Ms. Lala Chigusa who was chosen

620
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,583
before Ms. Akiba?

621
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,125
And one more person,

622
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,833
Ms. Shion Yamane who
is going to substitute for Ms. Kawabe too...

623
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,958
Huh? Her too...

624
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes... If after borrowing the Stradivarius
from Ms. Kawabe,

625
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,125
Ms. Yamane gives a great performance
at the concert

626
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,333
where a lot of internationally
famous musicians are present...

627
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:18,333
her name will instantly
become well-known worldwide.

628
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,833
By the way,

629
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,667
there's still one more thing though.
She is Mr.Domoto's favorite...

630
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,250
And he chose Ms. Kawabe to perform with him

631
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,208
Because he had his eyes not on her,

632
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,417
but on the Stradivarius that she owned...

633
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:37,375
He actually wanted to choose Shion...

634
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:41,042
So in order to choose Shion

635
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,750
and to make her play the Stradivarius,

636
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,042
he rigged it so that Ms. Kawabe
would be seriously injured.

637
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:48,708
This is also a possibility.

638
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,292
The relationship
between people is so complicated

639
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,500
that it's sort of difficult to understand...

640
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,792
In other words,

641
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:59,792
the one who has a motive against Ms. Kawabe
and Reiko is Ms. Lala Chgusa.

642
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,625
The one with a motive
only against Ms. Kawabe

643
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,708
is Mr. Domoto and Shion.

644
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,000
The only thing is,
all three of them seem to have no motive

645
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,458
against the foursome that have been killed...

646
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,625
Right.

647
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,208
Yeah, that's right...

648
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,625
Oh, was the piano in the practice room

649
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,458
that blew up a special kind of piano?

650
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:26,375
No, not that I know of...

651
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,167
Why do you think so?

652
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,000
When I went there some time ago,

653
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I saw the man called Mr. Fuwa

654
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,917
carry a piece of debris of the piano
with great care and take it home...

655
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:37,667
So, I thought that
maybe it was something special...

656
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:41,458
Hey, don't go skittering here
and there on your own!

657
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm sorry...

658
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,458
The piano was one that

659
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:48,750
Mr. Domoto continued to play
at his residence for more than 30 years.

660
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,708
When Mr. Domoto, retired as a pianist,

661
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:53,417
is seems to have been moved to the academy

662
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,667
to be used by the young students
for practice.

663
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,542
Of course when it was
at Mr. Domoto's residence,

664
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,458
and even after it was moved to the academy,

665
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,167
the piano seemed to be tuned by Mr. Fuwa...

666
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:08,792
Well,
I guess the piano was like a son to him.

667
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,500
Now do you get it, brat!

668
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,917
Come to think of it,

669
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:16,708
it seems that Mr. Fuwa
was didn't care much for them...

670
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:19,792
He seems to have thought that
they were not living their lives decently...

671
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,167
But, it's hard to think that
he would kill the foursome

672
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,708
just because of something like that,
isn't it?

673
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,208
Right...

674
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:29,250
Even if we were to assume

675
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,667
that he didn't like
how they lived their lives,

676
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:36,708
It would then leave Ms. Akiba
out of the picture...

677
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,417
Inspector, maybe Ms. Akiba's case

678
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:43,542
and the foursome should be
thought of separately...?

679
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:48,292
But, with all this happening
around Mr. Domoto,

680
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:51,792
don't you think that too many things
are coincidentally falling into place?

681
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,417
I guess so...

682
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,958
Well, at any rate,

683
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:58,333
I asked Takagi to keep guard over Ms. Akiba

684
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:02,000
at least until the concert
the day after tomorrow is finished,

685
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,458
because I felt there was a need to.

686
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,292
Uh,

687
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,250
but... she told me to stay away from her

688
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,042
because my being there was bugging her...

689
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,500
Darn...

690
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,625
Just what do you think you're doing,
Takagi...

691
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,000
If Reiko is attacked again,

692
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,167
a letter of apology
is not going to settle things, you know

693
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,958
But, she did say that she would stay
at home today and tomorrow.

694
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,250
You idiot!

695
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,542
How can you come back here just like that!

696
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:25,917
I ,I'm sorry...

697
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,542
(Mouri detective agency)

698
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,083
Bye!

699
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,542
Conan!

700
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:35,750
Good morning, Conan!

701
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,667
Good morning!

702
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:39,042
What's up, you guys,

703
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,542
from so early in the morning.

704
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,958
We're going to see Kamen Yaiba.

705
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,167
Kamen Yaiba?

706
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,750
We got a hold of
highly confidential information

707
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,458
that they would be shooting
an early morning location today

708
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,375
at Ryokuchi Park by Teimusu River.

709
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:54,208
We thought that seeing it,
would cheer Genta up a bit...

710
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:57,667
He doesn't look to be
in bad shape either way, though...

711
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,375
That's why we came to get you too, Conan...

712
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,042
Were you on your way somewhere?

713
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,708
Yeah... I was...

714
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,042
Where to...?

715
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,917
Does it matter where...?

716
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:10,125
Is it more important than your bond
of friendship with Genta!

717
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,000
... Oh boy

718
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,958
I'm going over to Reiko's place.

719
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,208
Reiko?

720
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't think you should.

721
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,333
I think you'll be scolded again...

722
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,417
Yeah... maybe,

723
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,667
but I've got to protect her from the bad guy.

724
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,292
Bad guy... You mean,
the one who attacked the other day...

725
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,625
You're going to protect her, Conan?

726
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,417
Oh, yeah, I wonder why...?

727
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,208
I don't really know why myself either...

728
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,792
But, I can't help myself
from wanting to do so.

729
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,125
It's just this feeling I have.

730
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:50,667
You're probably in love.

731
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:53,250
You do like older people, so...

732
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,875
Oh come on, no way...

733
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:58,250
At any rate, take care of Genta, okay.
I'm counting on both of you.

734
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,042
I'll leave it to you!

735
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:00,458
Conan...

736
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,708
Does this mean that
he has a lot of trust in us...

737
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:06,250
I guess so...

738
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,125
Yes.

739
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,167
Good morning, Reiko.

740
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,542
I'm sorry to be intruding on you.

741
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,458
Oh, hey, you?!

742
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,000
It's a nice condo...

743
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,333
It seems to be very quiet around here too...

744
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,083
Hey, you!

745
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:59,667
What's with you,
stomping into somebody's room like that?!

746
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:00,917
Just what do you want?

747
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:02,542
Singing lessons...

748
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,708
I want you to give me special training.

749
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,500
Oh, come to think of it,
you're that tone-deaf boy...

750
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,167
But, not today, no.

751
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:12,542
You're going out, right?

752
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,000
I heard that you always go forest bathing

753
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,292
before an important concert or recording
to refresh yourself.

754
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:22,458
Why'd you come if you knew about it?

755
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,875
So that I could keep you company.

756
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,625
Goodness... didn't I tell you last time?

757
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,500
That I don't want to stay around you people

758
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,458
because nothing good
seems to happen when I do...

759
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,125
You try to stay away from us by saying so

760
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,417
to keep us out of danger...

761
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:41,583
Because you're sure
that the culprit is after you...

762
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:46,125
You went to Genta's house with him,

763
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,542
not to complain to his parents,

764
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:51,625
but to see with your own eyes
that he got home safely, right?

765
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,167
Just what are you talking about.

766
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:56,917
Oh, before leaving, could I have some juice?

767
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,500
I'm thirsty .

768
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,167
Oh, boy...

769
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:06,250
All I've got is pure 100% orange juice,

770
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,667
but don't be spoiled, okay.

771
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,583
Okay, that's fine...

772
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,583
The flute...

773
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,542
Besides, that man...

774
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,167
Hey!

775
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:21,250
You're 10 years too young to be interested
in the bedroom of women!

776
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,875
Uh, do you also play the flute, Reiko?

777
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,000
It's none of your business!

778
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,042
After you drink it, hurry on home!

779
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:29,917
I'm not giving you singing lesson,

780
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,958
nor are you coming with me to the forest.

781
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:35,833
Okay...

782
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,750
I'll follow you on my own, so don't mind me.

783
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,833
Oh, boy... Don't blame me if you get lost.

784
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,292
I'll be fine, just fine.

785
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,458
Inspector Megure!

786
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,792
A connection's been found
between the foursome and Ms. Akiba!

787
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:07,875
What?!

788
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:09,875
In January 3 years ago,

789
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,042
at the lodging of Domoto Academy in Izu,

790
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:17,250
a flute player who was staying
with them at the lodge

791
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,667
got drunk and fell to his death from a cliff.

792
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,500
He was Mr. Hikaru Soma age 28.

793
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,000
He was in the 6th class of Domoto Academy.

794
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,208
Don't tell me that they?

795
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,292
No, although they were the ones that

796
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,417
forced Mr. Soma
who couldn't drink to drink...

797
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:34,750
it was concluded that they had nothing to do

798
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,375
with the victim falling off the cliff,

799
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,958
and the case was closed
as an unfortunate accident.

800
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,250
I see...

801
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,042
And, what's the connection with Ms. Akiba?

802
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:47,292
The thing is, this Mr. Soma happened
to be Ms. Akiba's fiancé.

803
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,333
What?!

804
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,500
Inspector...

805
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:55,042
It is very likely that she still
harbors hate towards the foursome...

806
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,000
But if so, why was she attacked...

807
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:23,417
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba... Let's all call him...

808
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:30,583
Kamen Yaiba,
Yaiba... He'll come running anytime...

809
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,000
Hello!

810
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,333
Hello...

811
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,417
Hello...

812
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,875
I wonder if those two are mother and child...

813
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,958
They don't look alike at all.

814
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,708
I wonder why they're walking so much
apart from each other?

815
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,208
Maybe his mother scolded him.

816
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:51,833
Oh boy...

817
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:55,750
Hey... Do you know why
I take a walk through the forest

818
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,833
the day before my concert?

819
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,750
I want to bring nature into my body...

820
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:09,167
Because the music of Europe
was born surrounded by great nature...

821
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,625
Do you understand?

822
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,792
I think I do...

823
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:37,167
Are you all right, Reiko?!

824
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,083
Yes...

825
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,292
Run!

826
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,042
Go ahead!

827
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,708
So, the culprit's struck again, after all.

828
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,125
This is bad!

829
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,208
She's going to be shot.

830
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,542
Reiko! This way!

831
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,250
Why... Why didn't the culprit shoot...

832
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,083
What the hell is the culprit after...?

833
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:42,625
Uh, shouldn't report this
to the police after all?

834
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,042
No, because like a just told you
a while ago,

835
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:47,000
f I report this to the police...

836
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,375
It's going to take up your time

837
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,000
and may get in the way of
your concert tomorrow, right?

838
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,708
I understand that too, but...

839
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:55,708
If you understand,
don't say a thing about it.

840
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:59,250
I'll go tell them about it,
once the concert is over.

841
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:00,625
Understand!

842
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,875
Okay...

843
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,708
Oh, Officer Takagi...

844
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,625
Oh, Ms. Akiba! Conan, you too...

845
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:17,500
Ms. Akiba, I've been looking for you.

846
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,917
You told me that
you weren't going anywhere today...

847
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:20,875
I was on a date with him.

848
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,542
A, A date...

849
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,000
Ms. Akiba, there's something
I'd like to speak to you about.

850
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,208
Later, okay...

851
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:29,750
It's about Mr. Hikaru Soma...

852
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:35,250
Mr. Hikaru Soma was your fiancé, wasn't he?

853
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,792
Inspector.
I will tell you everything I know.

854
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,875
But, please let me do
so after the concert tomorrow.

855
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:55,958
Uh, Inspector...
Does Mr. Soma have a mole over here?

856
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,667
Yeah, he does. But, why do you know...

857
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,250
Because I saw a picture of him
in Reiko's room...

858
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,375
Huh? Did you go inside Ms. Akiba's room?

859
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,000
Yep...

860
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:09,000
Right, will you please take me home!

861
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,292
I'll tell you everything I know.

862
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:15,708
So, we brought him here...

863
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,333
But, all he told us was

864
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:23,083
that he saw a picture of Mr. Soma
as well as a flute in her room.

865
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,875
My God...

866
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:27,083
But, Inspector.

867
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:31,042
Even if she did have a motive
to kill the foursome,

868
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,250
that doesn't conclude
that she's the culprit, does it?

869
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,250
She was in fact,
attacked by a truck after all...

870
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:40,667
Uh, didn't Mr. Soma have anyone else
in his family

871
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:42,458
that would've wanted to avenge his death?

872
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:44,750
No, not at all...

873
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,542
Uh, please have some tea.

874
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:48,958
Oh, thank you...

875
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,375
Thank you, Ran.

876
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:51,375
Here you go...

877
00:53:55,667 --> 00:54:00,667
Uh, his mother was an unwedded mother,
and she passed away 5 years ago.

878
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,333
He has no brothers or sisters.

879
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,625
Father?

880
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,333
No, we don't have any information on him.

881
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,833
We don't even know if he's alive or not.

882
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:09,917
That's...

883
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,417
(Hikaru Soma, deceased at 28,
Mother, deceased, Father unknown)

884
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:18,792
The foursome who were killed
have also caused other problems...

885
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:22,833
At times,
they would perform drunk at concerts,

886
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:25,708
And get bawled out by Mr. Domoto later.

887
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,250
What? When did this happen?!

888
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,667
Oh, yes, sir...

889
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,625
Here it is...

890
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,167
It was when they were performing

891
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:38,000
Beethoven's piano quartet
at a concert a year ago.

892
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,750
I got it, Inspector...

893
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,708
I know who killed the foursome,
seriously hurt Ms. Kawabe,

894
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:51,000
and attacked Ms Akiba,
as well as the culprit's motive for doing so.

895
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,208
Really, Mr. Mouri?!

896
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:56,083
Yes! The culprit is...

897
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,458
You! Mr. Genya Domoto!

898
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,917
Why, because you're a fan of Beethoven...

899
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:08,958
To...

900
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,542
the point of being a freak, a maniac!

901
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,000
Hey, just what do you think
you're saying out of the blue?!

902
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,250
You killed the foursome

903
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,292
because they performed Beethoven's piece
drunk on stage!

904
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:31,875
There couldn't be nothing more desecrating
to a great composer than this.

905
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:34,250
You seriously hurt Ms. Kawabe

906
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,000
because when you performed with her
in the past,

907
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,417
you got into a heated argument with her

908
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:40,792
about the interpretation of the piece...

909
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:46,000
This was written in detail
in Ms. Kawabe's essay...

910
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,375
You attacked Ms. Akiba
because during rehearsal...

911
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,125
Phooey, I hope you're not talking about
the 9th Symphony of Beethoven.

912
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,375
I hate it!

913
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,583
She bad-mouthed
the 9th Symphony of Beethoven!

914
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,458
Wait a minute!

915
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:06,875
It's true that I like Beethoven,
and I also respect him.

916
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,000
But, I'm not all that maniac over him.

917
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,792
No, there's no doubt about it.

918
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:16,083
The proof is that your hairstyle
is just like that of Beethoven!

919
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,958
M, Mr. Mouri?

920
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,250
You've gotta be kidding!

921
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,375
I've had this hairstyle since birth!

922
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,667
I took after my late mother!

923
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,375
If you insist that I'm lying

924
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:34,417
take a look!

925
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,208
T, True...

926
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,667
They look exactly alike...

927
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,583
Well?! When it comes to the foursome
and Ms. Akiba,

928
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:48,417
the story doesn't stand
unless I'm a Beethoven freak,

929
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,000
and when it comes to Ms. Kawabe,
we're both musicians.

930
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,583
There are times when we get into
heated disagreement regarding

931
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,417
interpretation of a piece.

932
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:58,042
But, that has to do
with the music we're playing

933
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:00,667
and it's no reason for hating each other...

934
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,208
It's so ridiculous,
it's not worth talking about!

935
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,375
Oh, but, you see...

936
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,792
Inspector!

937
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:08,125
Did you all come here at this time of night

938
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,708
to tell us your silly deduction?!

939
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:14,875
Moreover, we've got an important concert
coming up tomorrow!

940
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:17,583
Yes, we are fully aware of that...

941
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:20,542
Will you all please leave for tonight?

942
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:23,625
You can interrogate us
or do whatever you need to

943
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,583
after the concert is over!

944
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,750
I was pretty sure but...

945
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,542
Where does he get his confidence from anyway?

946
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,958
Uh, Officer Takagi.

947
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,833
Hasn't Ms. Kawabe gotten her memory back yet?

948
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:43,583
No, although she's recovered to the point
where she can chit-chat for a while.

949
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,000
She says incomprehensible things like,
the air conditioner has a pitch,

950
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,042
so it bothers her and she can't sleep.

951
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:55,458
The air conditioner has a pitch? Maybe...

952
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,500
We don't have to take it out right
now , do we?

953
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:02,958
Sorry,

954
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,000
please use this.

955
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,083
Thank you.

956
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,000
The contents of the program is the same
as the real performance

957
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,042
and we get to sit wherever we want to

958
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:15,333
in the empty audience so "Generalprobe"
is really worth seeing.

959
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,375
During the actual performance
we'll be sitting above.

960
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,583
I begged daddy to get the seats for us.

961
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:31,583
Wow! they're balcony seats!

962
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:35,458
There are 10 seats,
so we get to take up the whole space.

963
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,208
10 people...?

964
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:40,167
I invited Doc and the children too.

965
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,292
And one seat for Shinichi too.

966
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:45,375
Tell him about it.

967
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,125
And, also that he can get his ticket
at the reception desk.

968
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,792
Never mind a guy like him...

969
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:53,125
Never mind, just hurry and tell him.
We don't want to waste a seat, do we?!

970
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,958
Oh, okay...

971
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,917
I don't think he'll come, though...

972
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,375
Sorry, Ran...

973
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:10,375
I guess you didn't tell the police
about yesterday.

974
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,542
Thank you for now.

975
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,083
No problem...

976
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,792
But, is your leg okay?

977
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:18,500
Yes.
It won't interfere with my singing at all.

978
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:23,625
Uh, Ms. Kawabe has perfect pitch too,
doesn't she?

979
00:59:23,917 --> 00:59:27,292
Right.
I found out when I saw her during practice

980
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:29,500
and that's another reason we hit it off well.

981
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,833
What about it?

982
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,042
No, it's nothing.

983
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:37,625
Oh... I'll be going then.

984
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,167
Okay, give it your best shot.

985
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:47,417
Reiko and Ms. Kawabe
both have perfect pitch...

986
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,750
This means...

987
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,708
I didn't want to talk to him on the phone
so I send him mail.

988
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:55,792
Oh... I hope Shinichi can make it.

989
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,917
I couldn't care less either way...

990
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,958
But, I wouldn't want the seat to go to waste.

991
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,958
That's what I just said a while ago.

992
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,500
Huh? Oh, you did...?

993
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,667
We have no choice. Let's start without him.

994
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,292
Is anything the matter?

995
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:15,167
Oh, Mr. Mouri, Mr. Muller isn't here.

996
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,375
Huh? You mean the organ tuner?

997
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:21,833
He promised to tune the organ
during Generalprobe...

998
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,792
Oh my God.

999
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:26,542
He won't answer his cell phone

1000
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:29,875
and the hotel tells me he hasn't been back
from last night...

1001
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,667
From last night...

1002
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,667
Well, all that's left
is the final touches in tuning,

1003
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:37,792
so even if he doesn't show up,
it won't be all that much of a big deal...

1004
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:40,542
But, doesn't that mean that
his whereabouts is unknown?

1005
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,625
Did you notify the police?

1006
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,208
No... because it would be
too time-consuming and troublesome

1007
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,583
with all the questioning for now.

1008
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:51,458
I want everyone to concentrate
on the concert just yet.

1009
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:06,125
Shion looks like
a totally different person.

1010
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:12,750
"Ave Maria"

1011
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:22,458
"Full of grace"

1012
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:29,375
- "God be with you"
- This voice...

1013
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:49,167
""Praise be to You among women..."

1014
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,583
Shion's violin was really fantastic,
wasn't it?!

1015
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:57,250
Really! It was completely different
from the way she played during rehearsal.

1016
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,500
It was as if the Stradivarius was her own.

1017
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,250
What the...

1018
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,292
And, Reiko's singing was superb too!

1019
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,500
Conan!

1020
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,583
You guys... are here so early.

1021
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:20,583
We won't let you in even
if you're a minute late.

1022
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:23,417
We asked Dr. Agasa to bring us here early.

1023
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,792
What're you holding?

1024
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,417
I think it's a recorder.

1025
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:30,125
You idiot!

1026
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,375
Why would you bring something
like that to a concert

1027
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,375
that's going to be playing classical music!

1028
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,708
Don't get angry at him.
Genta says that since he has no voice,

1029
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:39,167
he wants to at least sound the recorder...

1030
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:40,750
But a recorder...

1031
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,000
Of course he won't sound it
during the performance,

1032
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,750
right Genta?

1033
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,833
He just answered yes.

1034
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:53,000
Keep it hidden when in the hall.

1035
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:56,208
No cell phones here either.

1036
01:03:56,208 --> 01:04:00,083
I know. I even made them leave
their detective badges behind.

1037
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,167
Uh, I'm hungry.

1038
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,667
Okay,
shall we have something light to eat then?

1039
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,958
I guess so. The performance starts at 5:00,

1040
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:11,417
and we don't want to get hungry
in the middle of the performance.

1041
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:17,167
He's saying,
"eels over rice, eels over rice."

1042
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:20,583
It'd be nice if he could have
conversation using the recorder.

1043
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:23,500
Oh, there's no reason why you can't.

1044
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,250
Just switch the notes for letters.

1045
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,375
Notes...

1046
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:29,375
To letters... did you say?

1047
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:32,583
But, since they're alphabets,

1048
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:34,458
I guess it's not possible
for Genta to handle.

1049
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,667
That sound bothers me after all.

1050
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:40,208
Ran,
I just remembered I have something to do.

1051
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,875
I promise I'll be back in time
for the performance.

1052
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,792
Hey, Conan!

1053
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:48,250
I tell you, that selfish brat.

1054
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,125
That sound!
Doesn't that note sound a little strange?

1055
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,333
Yes, I agree.

1056
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:16,958
I noticed while I was singing...

1057
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,750
I've figured out which key it was,

1058
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,500
but I can't tell
which stopper the tone belongs to,

1059
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:25,042
Because so many were being sounded
at the same time.

1060
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,583
It's slightly low after all,

1061
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,000
no doubt about it.

1062
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,250
It came from around there.

1063
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,417
I think it's the short pipe way inside.

1064
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,708
Just one of the keys are not tuned right.

1065
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,208
I'll have to have it fixed
before the actual performance.

1066
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:49,083
But, Mr. Muller's whereabouts is unknown,
right?

1067
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,125
Right.

1068
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,833
I'll go tell Mr. Domoto about this...

1069
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,792
He doesn't seem to be here...

1070
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:02,958
I guess not...

1071
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:05,375
I wonder if he went on a tea break
or something...

1072
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,750
Or, he may be over there...

1073
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:11,417
It's amazing you noticed that sound.

1074
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,000
I've got pretty good ears.

1075
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,875
It's way more than good.

1076
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:20,083
Maybe you've got perfect pitch too?

1077
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,458
I sure wish I did...

1078
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,375
Mr. Domoto's not around...

1079
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,208
Do you know of any other place he may be?

1080
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,292
Well...

1081
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,875
Maybe just like you said,
he may be having tea or something?

1082
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:05,417
Honoured guests,

1083
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:07,375
smoking is prohibited in all areas
of the building

1084
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:09,500
Ms. Akiba's still not here?!

1085
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,750
No, she's not answering her
cell phone either.

1086
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,458
I'm having the staff look for her too, but...

1087
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,417
Don't tell me that her whereabouts
is unknown too?!

1088
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:18,792
I don't know.

1089
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:21,333
First, it's Mr. Muller, and now her...

1090
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,583
What on earth is going on?!

1091
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,875
We've only got 15 minutes to go
before start time.

1092
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,458
If she doesn't come around till then...

1093
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,375
Please let me do it!

1094
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:34,333
After what happened to Ms. Kawabe,

1095
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:38,000
I continued practicing up to now

1096
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,833
just in case.

1097
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,125
But...

1098
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,250
Please!

1099
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,833
I promise I'll sing better than Ms. Akiba...

1100
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:52,000
No need to try singing better than her!

1101
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:56,625
Music is humans seeking answers from God...

1102
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,417
Sing as if praying...

1103
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,417
Shinichi didn't come after all.

1104
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,583
I wonder what's up with Conan,

1105
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,375
when the performance
is almost ready to begin.

1106
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,917
Really, I wonder where Conan went...

1107
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,333
Yep... but I'm sure Conan's okay!

1108
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,292
I believe him!

1109
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,792
I guess so!

1110
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:28,792
We should believe him

1111
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,125
like he believed in us!

1112
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,917
He'll be fine.
I just know Conan will be okay...

1113
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:41,500
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we have an announcement to make.

1114
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:45,250
Ms. Reiko Akiba who
was scheduled to sing today

1115
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,750
is suddenly unable to make it
for the performance.

1116
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:50,917
Singing in her place

1117
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:55,250
is Ms. Lala Chigusa of
the 9th class of Domoto Academy.

1118
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,917
We apologize for this sudden change
in performance

1119
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,875
and your understanding
is greatly appreciated.

1120
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:01,583
Why?!

1121
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:04,667
She was singing so beautifully
during Generalprobe and yet...

1122
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,625
I wonder if something happened to her
along with Shinichi.

1123
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,167
A vinyl sheet?!

1124
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,208
What is it?!

1125
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,750
Reiko! Reiko!

1126
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:40,250
What the?!

1127
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,125
Where is this?

1128
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,833
This is the downstream of
the canal.

1129
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,708
It's most likely that
the culprit who attacked us

1130
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,792
sailed us off into the canal

1131
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,458
from the lake at Domoto Academy...

1132
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:53,583
But, who on earth would...

1133
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:54,708
I have no idea.

1134
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,417
Besides,
why did the culprit knock us out first

1135
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,000
and out us on the boat?...

1136
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,167
I've got to get back quickly...

1137
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,333
or the concert will start...

1138
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,792
But... Even if we were to swim back,

1139
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:08,250
that wall is too high to climb...

1140
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,917
It seems like no one is here...

1141
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:27,833
I guess not... But, look.

1142
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,167
There's a telephone on that wall over there.

1143
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:34,667
If only we could reach it,
we can call for help...

1144
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,833
Wait here...
Even if we can't reach the phone,

1145
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,500
maybe we can call for help
if we can unhook the receiver...

1146
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,417
How do we do something like that...

1147
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,167
When you make a call
with a push button phone,

1148
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:48,292
the buttons make a sound don't they?

1149
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:51,667
That's called a DTMF signal.

1150
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:54,292
It sends a combination of
two signal tones of high and low

1151
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,875
in order to dial the number
that needs to be reached.

1152
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,250
So, if you can mimic the exact sound...

1153
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,375
We can make the call...

1154
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:08,875
I think it was, for the number
1 in 110 was 697 Hz and 1209 Hz.

1155
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:15,083
The number 0 is a combination of
941 Hz. and 1336 Hz...

1156
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,208
It's okay.

1157
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:19,125
I remember the sound of the buttons
of the phone by ear...

1158
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,167
But, first we have to unhook the receiver...

1159
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,667
Leave that to me!

1160
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:28,083
The problem is a few minutes
after the receiver his unhooked,

1161
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,583
we won't be able to another phone call
at all...

1162
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,625
In other words, we have only one chance...

1163
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:38,083
If we fail, we've got no choice
but to wait for someone to find us...

1164
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,250
We don't have time to wait...

1165
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,833
We have no other choice
but to give it a try...

1166
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:46,625
Okay, we've got to rehearse ASAP...

1167
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,500
What was that sound just now?...

1168
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,167
An explosion... Something exploded...

1169
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,167
It's in the direction of Domoto Hall!

1170
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:58,958
Don't tell me that...

1171
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,500
This is the West Tama City Forest of Music!

1172
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:16,083
A little while before,
there were two explosions at Domoto Hall.

1173
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
The explosion seems to have occurred
on the innermost part

1174
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,542
on the left hand side of the hall

1175
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,042
and the doorway to backstage
in the center left!

1176
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,000
The concert has begun 5 minutes ago!

1177
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,500
We still have no information
on how things are inside!

1178
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:30,792
Again...!

1179
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:32,750
Quick! The next number zero!

1180
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,250
I guess we'll make it.

1181
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,500
Let's pull the boat closer.

1182
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,792
Over here is fine! Stop the boat!

1183
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,083
And,
how are you going to unhook the receiver?

1184
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,458
Watch.

1185
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,500
Wow!

1186
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,583
Here goes!

1187
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,042
Yes, this is
the police department communications room.

1188
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:34,542
What?! Ms. Akiba and Conan?!

1189
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,708
Yeah... They were hit by someone,

1190
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:40,542
put on a boat and made to sail
to where the canal is.

1191
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:44,542
The location
is West Tama City West Tama reservoir...

1192
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,542
There they are!

1193
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,625
There they are! Over there!

1194
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:05,750
So, it's the Domoto Hall after all?

1195
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,917
Yes, there have already been a total of
more than 10 explosions already.

1196
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:11,250
All of them
were the pillars outside the building,

1197
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,833
but we haven't found
what's causing the explosions yet...

1198
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,250
Somebody set the bombs up.

1199
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,375
I don't know if they're time bombs
or set off by remote control,

1200
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,667
but it's most probably the being done

1201
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:22,833
by the same person
who killed the foursome...

1202
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,583
I guess so, because the first case
also involved an explosion...

1203
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:30,375
I wonder why the culprit
didn't kill us but rather,

1204
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,125
pulled us far away from Domoto Hall...?

1205
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:36,333
Don't tell me that...

1206
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,125
Not again...

1207
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:46,375
Um! Can't you call inside?!

1208
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,333
Ran and Pops are inside...

1209
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,958
Well, we can't get through by phone.

1210
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:53,000
Maybe the culprit cut the lines...

1211
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,333
What about the cell phones...

1212
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:55,417
No way.

1213
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,250
It's manners to switch the phones off
during the performance

1214
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,042
and except for a certain area,

1215
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,167
the inside of the hall
is out of service range...

1216
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:05,750
Besides, I think that all is fine inside...

1217
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:11,000
The entire inside of the hall
is completely sound and water proof...

1218
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,750
Maybe they haven't even noticed
that it's exploding outside...

1219
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:18,458
Which means that
the concert is still proceeding?

1220
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,667
Yes, I'm sure.

1221
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,667
But, we can't be sure that the explosions

1222
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,167
are going to be
limited to outside the hall...

1223
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,208
I'm sure that the explosions
will start occurring inside eventually...

1224
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,750
if not already...

1225
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:32,500
Ran...

1226
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:44,875
"And gave himself to me"

1227
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:59,250
"Therefore I will not leave Jesus"

1228
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:11,833
"Even if I feel my heart is hurting"

1229
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,500
Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.

1230
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,000
Thank you so very much for coming tonight,

1231
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,333
I am Kazuki Domoto.

1232
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,667
As you all already know,

1233
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:14,333
tonight we finally get to present
to you this pipe organ performance.

1234
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,583
Hurry, this way! Over this way, this way!

1235
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:20,667
Just what's taking you so long!
Hurry up and bring the hose!

1236
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,000
My God...

1237
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,042
But the hall
in the middle hasn't been bombed...

1238
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:37,583
I'm sure the people inside are safe!

1239
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,458
Too soon to get optimistic!

1240
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,458
All the places making entry
from outside possible are closed off...

1241
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,042
It's impossible to rescue
those inside in this situation.

1242
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:46,125
Oh no...

1243
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:50,000
Besides, we don't know which pillar
is going to explode next either...

1244
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,042
There is a total of 23 pillars
on the outside...

1245
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:55,625
I wonder if the culprit is planning
to blow all of them up...

1246
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,833
Darn... what can we do...?

1247
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,417
We've got no choice but to go
in from the ceiling...

1248
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,333
Do you think you can?

1249
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,167
If we do it now, we may be able to
manage getting in that way...

1250
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,583
However,
this is not a heliport to begins with so,

1251
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:10,542
I'm not sure if the roof can endure
the weight of the chopper...

1252
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:11,875
Okay.

1253
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,458
Please fly as low as you possibly can.

1254
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:16,000
We'll jump from there!

1255
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,708
Let me show you the way!

1256
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:22,750
The corridor going from the roof
to the 4th floor is complicated.

1257
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:23,583
That's why...

1258
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,208
No, but that would be too dangerous...

1259
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,208
We don't have time to be arguing, do we?

1260
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:30,167
Let's hurry
while the explosions are stopped!

1261
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:37,083
Lower!

1262
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,292
More!...

1263
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:41,250
A little more!

1264
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,583
A little bit more!...

1265
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,125
I can't take it any lower!

1266
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,083
The air current is worse than I thought,

1267
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,583
so the chopper can't maintain stability...

1268
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:53,708
Jump our while you can!

1269
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,708
Let's go, Ms. Akiba...

1270
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:08,333
Conan, you stay here in the chopper, okay...

1271
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,417
What the... Conan?!

1272
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm going to stay back here too!

1273
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Until Ran and all the others are rescued!

1274
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Conan!

1275
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,542
Besides, I've seen the culprit!

1276
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,083
What?! I don't know if it's the same person
who's causing the explosions,

1277
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:24,500
but I saw the face of the one who hit us!

1278
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,417
The person may be inside this hall, right?
So...

1279
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,625
Hey, hurry up!
I can't hold this thing any longer!

1280
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,333
Okay, I guess I'll have to take you along...

1281
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,917
Hurry, Takagi!

1282
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:37,917
Okay!

1283
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,125
This is the inner corridor of the 4th floor.

1284
01:19:58,417 --> 01:20:02,042
I mean, which just came straight down!

1285
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,750
You wouldn't have let me down
if I didn't say what I did, right?

1286
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,208
I just did what he did.

1287
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:10,417
I wonder
if he really saw the face of the culprit?

1288
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,750
What a surprise...

1289
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,417
I didn't think it possible,

1290
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,875
but they really don't seem to
have noticed the explosions...

1291
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,750
Let's search for the bomb...

1292
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,333
because it's impossible
to evacuate this many people at once...

1293
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:45,667
If the purpose of the culprit is
to bomb this hall,

1294
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:49,083
I'm sure that a bomb
is also set inside this hall too.

1295
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,250
Okay!

1296
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:54,042
Conan, you and Ms. Akiba stay right here,
okay?

1297
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:55,125
Okay!

1298
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:55,708
Let's go!

1299
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,792
Okay!

1300
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,708
Ran...

1301
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,083
Hold on...

1302
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:22,417
Inside! How're things inside?!

1303
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:42,667
"Come to Him all who are weary"

1304
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:53,792
"Come to Him all who are burdened"

1305
01:21:54,125 --> 01:22:01,000
"And he will give you relief"

1306
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,458
The culprit is someone who knows
this hall inside out,

1307
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,833
as well as set a bomb up...

1308
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:11,375
I'm sure the culprit
is among the members of the staff...

1309
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,708
Something's wrong with this sound
after all...

1310
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:19,250
If it were the piano,

1311
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,583
I know Mr. Domoto
would be able to tell right away,

1312
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,167
but since it's only been two years
since he started playing the pipe organ,

1313
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,625
I guess it's tough to notice
the difference in sound...

1314
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,583
Difference in sound?

1315
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:31,958
Amateurs who cannot tell
the difference of sound apart...

1316
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:34,167
So, that's the story...

1317
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,500
Ms. Kawabe noticed the difference in sound...

1318
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,667
because she has perfect pitch...

1319
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,625
But wait a sec...

1320
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:44,417
Then, why did that person...

1321
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:46,708
Don't tell me that... that person...

1322
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:48,833
If so, why her...

1323
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,042
His mother was an unwedded mother...

1324
01:22:57,542 --> 01:23:00,500
I see... So, that's it...

1325
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,417
But... what does the difference
in sound have to do with the explosions...

1326
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:10,000
I just realized now but,

1327
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,500
the time when the explosions stopped
for a while

1328
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,500
coincides with the time that

1329
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,792
Mr. Domoto was making his opening speech,
right?

1330
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,708
Maybe the culprit

1331
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:19,792
didn't want anyone to notice
the sound of the explosions after all...?

1332
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:22,125
No, that's not it!

1333
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:24,875
The explosions are set off only
when he plays the instrument!

1334
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,417
I see. That's why the sound's not right...

1335
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,083
It's that sound again...

1336
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:34,125
Uh,
how many times was that sound heard?

1337
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,625
Do you know how many times
that off tune sound was heard

1338
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,875
since the concert started till now?

1339
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,667
Uh... I'm sure it was...

1340
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:43,000
Twice during the first Ave Maria...

1341
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:51,250
10 times...
in Cantata that was played next...

1342
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:06,542
And, the one being played now,
makes it 8 times...

1343
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,333
So, it sounded a total of 20 times.

1344
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,833
So, there'll most likely
be four more explosions!

1345
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:15,042
That particular sound
and the explosions are working together!

1346
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:17,792
That's why there was no explosion

1347
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,292
while Mr. Domoto
was delivering his greetings.

1348
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:33,500
There are 23 pillars outside the hall.

1349
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,500
In other words,

1350
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,417
to explode all the pillars

1351
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:38,250
and inside the hall as well

1352
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,833
24 explosions need to take place...

1353
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,250
Which means...

1354
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,042
Right...

1355
01:24:50,292 --> 01:24:54,250
He's got to stop playing before the sound
is heard 4 times from now,

1356
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:57,125
or the bomb within this hall
will explode...

1357
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,208
It's that sound again.

1358
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:10,667
Darn, it's connected to that sound

1359
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:14,000
after all... I'm pretty sure the culprit
is watching from somewhere...

1360
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,417
Again!

1361
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:25,875
I've found him!

1362
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:27,958
It's him after all...

1363
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:31,958
Okay!

1364
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,500
I'll go up on stage
and stop the performance!

1365
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,667
Wait!

1366
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,250
If you stop the performance,

1367
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,250
the culprit will use the remote controller!

1368
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,167
I've found the culprit
holding the remote controller!

1369
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:42,792
But...

1370
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:44,375
Darn, what can we do...

1371
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:46,750
Isn't there a way in which

1372
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,042
we can stop the performance
without being noticed...

1373
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:50,250
Isn't there a way to make the culprit

1374
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,500
have second thoughts
about making the bomb go off...

1375
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,583
3 minutes...

1376
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,792
Is 3 minutes enough?

1377
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,208
Yes... but...

1378
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:06,708
I'm counting on you, Mr. Detective...

1379
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:18,208
"As long as you're here"

1380
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:27,250
"I believe in our love"

1381
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:34,625
"How beautiful"

1382
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,708
"How beautiful that voice"

1383
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:54,792
"Who saved a wretch like me"

1384
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,500
It's Reiko!

1385
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,875
This song...!

1386
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,875
It's Amazing Grace...

1387
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:10,506
"...was lost, but now I'm found"

1388
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:23,458
"was blind but now I see"

1389
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,125
What's she going to do at this point...

1390
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,621
"Was Grace..."

1391
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:51,792
"Amazing Grace,

1392
01:28:51,792 --> 01:28:58,375
"how sweet the sound"

1393
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:12,500
"That saved a wretch like me"

1394
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:25,250
"I once was lost, but now am found"

1395
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:38,000
"Was blind but now I see"

1396
01:29:39,265 --> 01:29:44,874
"Was Grace that taught..."

1397
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,917
The person back then...

1398
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:49,333
was Reiko after all...

1399
01:29:52,611 --> 01:29:58,489
"And Grace, my fears relieved"

1400
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:01,667
It should've been erased after all...

1401
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:02,958
You can't erase it...

1402
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:07,958
You can't do anything about the voice
that touches the hearts of others...

1403
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:11,458
That's why you were hesitant too, right?

1404
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,417
Besides,

1405
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:19,125
this song is your son,
Mr. Soma's... favorite song...

1406
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:24,417
And, the one singing it,
is the woman your son loved...

1407
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:27,417
The key to the deduction

1408
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:29,083
was the difference in sound...

1409
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:31,417
At first I thought
that the difference in sound

1410
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:33,708
was because of the tuning...

1411
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:35,708
But, no...

1412
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:39,125
I found that a small sensor
that detects air flow

1413
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:43,417
was set up inside
one of the pipes of the organ,

1414
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:47,458
and only the sound
that came out from there was slightly off...

1415
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:52,167
When the sensor inside the pipe detects
the flow of air

1416
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:57,250
A signal is sent to the bombs
that are set up in order,

1417
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,542
and they explode.

1418
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:06,167
When the last bomb explodes,

1419
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:08,750
this entire hall collapses...

1420
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:12,250
There was no explosion during Generalprobe

1421
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,250
because the blasting machine
was switched off,

1422
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,750
isn't that right...?

1423
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,583
Former building head of Domoto Hall

1424
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:23,167
as well as piano tuner, Mr. Takumi Fuwa...

1425
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:31,250
It's not here either...

1426
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,000
Bad...

1427
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,417
The bomb may go off before we find it...

1428
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,792
Quiet!...

1429
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,583
What is this sound?

1430
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:06,958
Don't move!

1431
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,125
Police!

1432
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,458
Mr. Muller...?

1433
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:19,958
"How sweet the sound"

1434
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:23,042
How did you figure out it was me?...

1435
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:25,208
Perfect pitch...

1436
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,792
Mr. Fuwa, you have perfect pitch

1437
01:32:28,792 --> 01:32:30,583
and yet you didn't point
anything out regarding

1438
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:32,250
the difference in sound
during Generalprobe, did you?... .

1439
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:35,708
That's when I thought something was fishy...

1440
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,250
I see...

1441
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:43,958
and how did you figure out
I was Hikaru's father?...

1442
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:48,167
Your car's license plate number,

1443
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:51,375
52-83...
That's your son's birthday, isn't it?

1444
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:56,292
You used it as a proof of bond
between you and your son

1445
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:58,833
that you couldn't expose to the public...

1446
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,792
And the picture of you in your younger days

1447
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:04,125
that I saw at Mr. Domoto's house...

1448
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,250
You looked so much like your son...

1449
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:13,542
You killed the four musicians

1450
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:16,375
as to avenge the death of your son
who died of an accident...

1451
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,542
You left the parts of
the flute back at the scene

1452
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:21,167
to deceive the police into thinking

1453
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,708
that the three cases
completed the serial killings...

1454
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:29,000
You hurt Ms. Yasuko Kawabe
and got her messed up in this case,

1455
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:34,042
she has perfect pitch and would've noticed
the difference in sound...

1456
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:37,417
People who are afraid of people
with perfect pitch

1457
01:33:37,417 --> 01:33:39,708
are only those who themselves,
have perfect pitch...

1458
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:43,708
From this standpoint, you're the only one
who could've done all this...

1459
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:47,625
And one other person...

1460
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:51,167
Ms. Reiko Akiba also has perfect pitch.

1461
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:03,417
But, being that
she was your late son's fiancé,

1462
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:07,625
you couldn't make yourself use a bomb
on her that may take her life,

1463
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,458
as you did with Yasuko...

1464
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:15,750
That's why you drugged her drink,

1465
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,208
and attacked her using the dump truck
and the air rifle.

1466
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:21,458
In order to make her stay off the stage,

1467
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:23,542
all you had to do
was make her lose her voice

1468
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:26,458
and break her leg...

1469
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:43,625
"Was blind but now I see"

1470
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:13,667
He played it!

1471
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,292
Why... Why...

1472
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:31,083
It won't explode...

1473
01:35:31,917 --> 01:35:33,833
We removed the sensor

1474
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:37,458
that was set up inside the pipe
before coming here...

1475
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:38,625
3 minutes...

1476
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,833
No, 2 minutes was enough to do it...

1477
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:46,708
You're really something, sonny...

1478
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,792
What was your name again?

1479
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:51,000
Conan Edogawa

1480
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,250
A detective...

1481
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,417
Bravo!

1482
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:01,208
Bravo! Bravo!

1483
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,792
There he is...

1484
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,208
He's holding a remote controller...

1485
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:08,417
Then, he's the one after all...

1486
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,083
What shall we do?...

1487
01:36:10,292 --> 01:36:12,208
Shall we break in before it explodes...

1488
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:13,458
No!

1489
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,625
The minute we break in,

1490
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,667
he'll blow the place up
with the remote controller!

1491
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:18,875
Then, what on earth do we do...

1492
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:22,042
That room...

1493
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:25,000
If from that room,
I may be able to do something about it...

1494
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,417
Do what...

1495
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,417
I'm going to fire at him...

1496
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:30,708
before he pushes the switch
of the remote controller...

1497
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:38,333
Too bad Mr. Detective...

1498
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:41,792
I can bomb this place
using this remote controller...

1499
01:36:41,792 --> 01:36:43,417
You lose.

1500
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:44,708
I wonder about that...

1501
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:46,458
You can't really tell yet...

1502
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,292
What can't I tell...

1503
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:54,292
I don't know how you guys made it
into this hall but,

1504
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:57,917
the fact that they're not breaking in

1505
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:01,000
must mean that just a planned,
the hall is enveloped in flames

1506
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,750
and they can't come in.

1507
01:37:04,292 --> 01:37:07,167
I didn't count
on the sensor being removed but...

1508
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,625
all is well...

1509
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:13,625
because now I get to bomb
the place whenever I wish to...

1510
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:17,458
I'll send everyone off to the world beyond

1511
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:20,375
while the performance is still in session
as my farewell gift...

1512
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,458
Darn! Back then...

1513
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:33,708
I'll blow you up
while you're playing your favorite organ...

1514
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:36,167
Kazuki Domoto...

1515
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,750
Conan...

1516
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:49,458
No good... I can't shoot...

1517
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,583
All right. Hurry up and start playing again,

1518
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:03,583
Domoto...

1519
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,833
What shall I do...

1520
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:07,125
I can't use the tranquilizer gun.

1521
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:09,000
Which means...
What other way could there be...

1522
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:13,125
Move out of the way, Conan...

1523
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:14,875
Please!

1524
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:23,833
Lend it to me!

1525
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,542
M, My recorder...

1526
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,167
I got my voice back!

1527
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,083
Okay, go on...

1528
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,167
Darn!

1529
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,750
This is goodbye, Mr. Detective...

1530
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:44,917
No way!

1531
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:54,583
mi-la-la-la-fa

1532
01:38:56,042 --> 01:38:57,042
Shoot!

1533
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:58,083
Shoot?

1534
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,042
What was that sound, just now?

1535
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:02,292
The whistle signaling the end of the game!

1536
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,625
What?!

1537
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:17,792
Police! Freeze!

1538
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:21,250
I lose...

1539
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:14,667
Mr. Fuwa,

1540
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,208
where is the remaining bomb?

1541
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:19,042
In the attic right above the stage...

1542
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,750
Officer Takagi, contact the Inspector.

1543
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Yes, ma'am!

1544
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:25,167
I know I have no right to but...

1545
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:29,542
Would you let me listen to
the performance till the end?

1546
01:40:29,542 --> 01:40:32,708
I will tell you everything after that...

1547
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:45,042
Okay.

1548
01:40:45,042 --> 01:40:47,667
The fire's almost extinguished here too,

1549
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,750
-so we'll all be there on the double...
-Inspector!

1550
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:53,042
There's an opening
in one part on the east side!

1551
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:54,250
Okay, let's go!

1552
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:55,917
I'll call you again!

1553
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:05,542
Uh... why did you set bombs to this hall?

1554
01:41:06,667 --> 01:41:08,833
I've been serving as...

1555
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:13,708
Kazuki Domoto's exclusive piano tuner
for the past 35 years.

1556
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,958
We walked along life together...

1557
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,667
However, two years ago,

1558
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:23,875
he suddenly retired his position
as a pianist...

1559
01:41:27,542 --> 01:41:29,083
Then, he tells me

1560
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,750
that he wants me to be head of the building

1561
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:34,208
the will be completed in two years...

1562
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:37,167
Of course, I couldn't refuse...

1563
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:41,292
He said I'd be free
to continue tuning pianos...

1564
01:41:41,292 --> 01:41:41,917
But,

1565
01:41:41,917 --> 01:41:43,917
being that I was,

1566
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,917
the internationally famous pianist,

1567
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:49,750
Kazuki Domoto's exclusive piano tuner
for the past 35 years,

1568
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,875
I just couldn't make myself
become a tuner for anybody else...

1569
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,708
My pride wouldn't allow me to do so...

1570
01:41:56,917 --> 01:42:00,417
But then again, I'm just a mere craftsman...

1571
01:42:00,417 --> 01:42:03,458
I couldn't see myself being able to
handle the work of building head...

1572
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:06,833
I was overwhelmed with grief...

1573
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:47,917
Just two years ago,
I lost my wife, and a year after

1574
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:51,083
that my son dies of an accident...

1575
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:55,917
And, I end up losing the only thing left
for me to live for,

1576
01:42:55,917 --> 01:42:57,750
my job as a piano tuner.

1577
01:42:57,750 --> 01:43:01,125
I have nothing to live for anymore...

1578
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:04,667
The music that I loved so much

1579
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:09,083
has changed into discord unpleasant
to my ears...

1580
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:16,167
Right... I hear sounds my dreams.

1581
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:19,708
I jumped out of bed that night
after having a nightmare...

1582
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:24,167
and decided... that I would erase everything,

1583
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:28,000
in order to get back quiet nights...

1584
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,750
I wanted to erase everything,

1585
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:30,958
of course the foursome
who took my son's life,

1586
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:32,583
selfish Domoto,

1587
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:34,750
the pipe organ that took his interest
away from the piano,

1588
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,125
and Domoto Hall...

1589
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:41,042
I also want to get rid of the lives
of all the musicians the world over,

1590
01:43:41,042 --> 01:43:45,000
and audience who come to
listen to the organ performance!

1591
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:51,042
I agreed to be appointed
the head of Domoto Hall...

1592
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:52,958
I thought it was the best position to be in

1593
01:43:53,292 --> 01:43:55,667
if I wanted to rig the organ

1594
01:43:55,667 --> 01:43:58,958
and set up the bomb in the hall...

1595
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:03,875
On the other hand,
I couldn't help feeling sorry

1596
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,875
for the piano that was disposed
of by Domoto, just like me...

1597
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:07,375
So...

1598
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:10,583
You mean you bombed the practice room
along with the piano

1599
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:13,292
out of love for the piano...?

1600
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,042
This is my entire story...

1601
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:18,500
Okay, then...

1602
01:44:21,792 --> 01:44:24,208
Will you please tell Domoto to come here.

1603
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:26,250
Mr. Fuwa, please calm down!

1604
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,583
Don't worry...

1605
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:29,458
This is so I can commit suicide...

1606
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:32,000
I have no intention of hurting any of you...

1607
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,958
Conan, please leave the room.

1608
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:37,583
No way! How dare you kill yourself

1609
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:39,792
without first making amends.

1610
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:41,375
I won't let you do something unfair
like that!

1611
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,583
Conan!

1612
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:44,958
Mr. Fuwa! Don't do anything stupid!

1613
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:47,667
Shut up! Hurry up and call Domoto!

1614
01:44:47,667 --> 01:44:48,833
Mr. Fuwa!

1615
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,583
I'm over here.

1616
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,417
Mr. Domoto!

1617
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:02,375
Mr. Fuwa, I'm sorry...

1618
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:05,917
I had no idea that you were cornered
to such a point...

1619
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:07,458
So, you finally understand

1620
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:09,708
what I had to go through
thanks to your selfishness...

1621
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,875
That's not it, Mr. Fuwa...

1622
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:14,750
I retired from being a pianist

1623
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:19,708
because I noticed that your tuning
was becoming slightly off tune...

1624
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,625
I couldn't bring myself to tell you thinking

1625
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,042
that I might hurt your pride...

1626
01:45:25,417 --> 01:45:27,083
Yet, I didn't feel like forming a team

1627
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,167
with a new tuner either at this point...

1628
01:45:30,542 --> 01:45:33,375
that's why I retired
from playing the piano...

1629
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:36,208
It can't be! I have perfect pitch...

1630
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:39,667
It's true that you have perfect pitch...

1631
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,917
But, I think that your auditory senses
have gone downhill because of age...

1632
01:45:43,917 --> 01:45:47,708
I experienced the same thing
of not being able

1633
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:49,250
to tell whether the notes
were slightly off key...

1634
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:55,167
That's a lie... a lie...
It's a lie... a lie...

1635
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:57,458
If I knew
it was going to turn out like this,

1636
01:45:57,458 --> 01:46:00,750
I should've told you the truth
to begin with...

1637
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,875
I'm really sorry...

1638
01:46:02,875 --> 01:46:04,375
Too late apologizing now!

1639
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:06,000
It's all your fault!

1640
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,208
Wrong!

1641
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,542
If my best friend did the same thing to me,

1642
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:16,500
I would think that she must've had some damn
good reason to have done so...

1643
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,125
and that,

1644
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:20,458
it could be something that she had done,
not for herself,

1645
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:24,500
but rather, out of consideration for me...

1646
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,583
I think that's
what would first come to mind...

1647
01:46:27,042 --> 01:46:28,583
Why,

1648
01:46:29,458 --> 01:46:31,917
because I believe my best friend...

1649
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:34,875
... I would feel the same too!

1650
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,458
Too think that there
was an explosion like this outside...

1651
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:08,833
We didn't notice anything at all...

1652
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:12,292
Conan seems to have helped out a lot too.

1653
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:16,167
Just like I thought.

1654
01:47:16,167 --> 01:47:17,208
It was just as I said, wasn't it.

1655
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:21,667
It's amazing that Shinichi understood
the message you sent on the recorder.

1656
01:47:21,667 --> 01:47:24,292
Changing the name of notes into alphabets

1657
01:47:24,292 --> 01:47:26,792
come out in detective novels too.

1658
01:47:26,792 --> 01:47:30,167
In German the B note is referred to as H.

1659
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:34,750
But,
since he knows that my mother is English,

1660
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,000
I think he deduced on the spot

1661
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,167
that I was playing the B note.

1662
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:41,375
This depended on his quick
deduction skills.

1663
01:47:42,292 --> 01:47:45,583
Then, I counted on his perfect pitch.

1664
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:47,375
I see...

1665
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:50,875
Besides, I believe him too...

1666
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,042
As a partner...

1667
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:59,458
I was pretty sure that
the Beethoven guy was the one, though...

1668
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:02,000
Dad, are you still at it?

1669
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,083
But, that deduction freak
didn't come after all,

1670
01:48:05,083 --> 01:48:06,750
did he.

1671
01:48:07,083 --> 01:48:08,250
Oh, Shinichi?

1672
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,500
Never mind that guy already...

1673
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,208
Come on, let's go, Conan...

1674
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:15,417
He was here till just a while ago, but...

1675
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:26,292
Uh... this sound...

1676
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,625
Oh, the violin...

1677
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,542
It's Amazing Grace.

1678
01:48:32,542 --> 01:48:35,042
I mean, the way the violin is being played...

1679
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:36,208
The way the violin is played?

1680
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,583
Shinichi.

1681
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:41,917
Hey, Ran?!

1682
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:02,000
Shinichi! Shinichi!

1683
01:49:03,292 --> 01:49:05,708
Shinichi, left!

1684
01:49:06,792 --> 01:49:07,917
Conan!

1685
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,375
He says he has to work on a case...

1686
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:11,875
So, it was Shinichi, after all!

1687
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:15,208
He said that after hearing Reiko sing,

1688
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:17,667
he recalled what happened 3 years ago,

1689
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:20,667
so he took the violin that was backstage

1690
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:22,917
and played the song you
just heard a while ago.

1691
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:27,667
He said that he was playing
for you and himself!

1692
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:33,625
Shinichi was saying he felt bad
for what he did to you...

1693
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:35,792
Did you have a fight or something?

1694
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:38,958
Oh, nope... It's nothing...

1695
01:49:40,542 --> 01:49:43,292
I wouldn't forgive you
if you came along now, anyway...

1696
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:49,083
Idiot...

1697
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:18,292
I... came here a lot with him...

1698
01:54:18,708 --> 01:54:21,208
It was our dating course...

1699
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:23,458
Oh! is that so...

1700
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,833
The spring that he passed away
because of the accident,

1701
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:28,292
I sang the song that he liked here

1702
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:30,750
where we used to date...

1703
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,667
And that song was Amazing Grace.

1704
01:54:34,083 --> 01:54:35,167
Right!

1705
01:54:35,708 --> 01:54:40,708
I... used to hate those four
at the beginning...

1706
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:44,208
To the point where I really wanted
to kill them myself...

1707
01:54:44,625 --> 01:54:47,042
But, I've decided to forgive them...

1708
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:51,917
Because Amazing Grace
is a song of forgiveness...

1709
01:54:54,375 --> 01:54:56,333
I'll be on my way, then...

1710
01:54:56,625 --> 01:54:59,083
Conan,
let's harmonize together again someday.

1711
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:03,208
See you...

1712
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:04,958
Bye.

1713
01:55:05,542 --> 01:55:06,792
Bye-bye.

1714
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:11,958
By the way, Ran,

1715
01:55:11,958 --> 01:55:15,792
how did you know
that Shinichi was playing back then?

1716
01:55:16,167 --> 01:55:19,875
Oh... because he
has a strange habit when playing,

1717
01:55:19,875 --> 01:55:21,667
that you can tell right away.

1718
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:24,333
I see...

1719
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:33,917
What did she mean
when she said strange habit when playing?

1720
01:55:51,958 --> 01:55:54,667
I won't just let him get away.

1721
01:55:54,667 --> 01:55:57,792
This is the best time
to send him out into the wild.
