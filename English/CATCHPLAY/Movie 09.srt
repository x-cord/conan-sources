00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:11,821

Yashiro's Residence

14
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:46,768
(Hideto Yashiro, 49 years old
Ship Engineer)

15
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:20,698
Beautiful view

16
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:26,368
Great sunset view wish
Shinichi with us to watch it

17
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,866
I'm watching it now...

18
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:35,374
what?

19
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,866
you can watch it better from here

20
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,548
ofcourse it's better

21
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,498
but it's so umberessing

22
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,308
we see that Conan

23
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,098
put me down Ran

24
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,938
we saw it

25
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:57,128
did you ask Ran to hold you?

26
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,478
I didn't, stupid

27
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,788
your face turned to red Conan

28
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,348
what are you saying it's because of the sunset

29
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:08,128
really, this kid very shy

30
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,018
not that, stupid

31
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:13,068
not that, stupid

32
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,508
what are you saying it's because of the sunset

33
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,578
it's the same as that time

34
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:21,398
what?

35
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,428
nothing

36
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,708
what is it? tell me

37
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:28,618
I told you it's nothing

38
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,498
I know there is something

39
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,200
Detective CONAN
Strategy Above The Depth

40
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,158
I'm detective Kodu Shinichi

41
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:35,238
While I was with my fiance Ran Mori at fun city

42
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:39,118
I saw a man wearing a black suit
making an illegal deal

43
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,618
but then while I was busy watching

44
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,918
his friend knocked me from behind

45
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,268
then forced me to take a medicene

46
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,178
when I woke up

47
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,788
my body shrank

48
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,118
if the gang wearing black suits
discovers Kudo still alive

49
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:00,608
then everybody I know will be in danger

50
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:04,328
I did as Prof Agasa advised me
and hid my identity

51
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:08,288
so when Ran asked me about my name
I told her Edogawa Conan

52
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,489
in purpose to find any lead to them,

53
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:13,447
I decided to live in Ran's Father
investgation agency apartment

54
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:20,118
I'm Genta Kojima, school boy detective
first year class 2

55
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,008
I'm Metsu, the same class

56
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:24,958
I'm Aiumy Yushida

57
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:26,628
with my assistor Conan

58
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:27,868
and Ai, we form

59
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:33,588
the detective squad kids

60
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:38,558
this is the squad badge
contains wirless chip inside

61
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:41,498
we can use it also to track others movments

62
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:44,408
this watch can produce light

63
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,428
we can use it under water
because it's against water

64
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:52,638
this two devices invented by Prof. Agasa

65
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,628
Prof. Agasa invented many useful tools for me

66
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,798
since my body shrank

67
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:04,338
among these tools,
the trenqulizer watch and the voice changer tie

68
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:09,848
it is the reason which give birth
to the famous sleeping detective Muri

69
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,198
yeah, Hiybara Ai

70
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,478
she's acting cool all the time

71
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,668
also she looks mature

72
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,788
ofcourse she is

73
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,978
Hiybara Ai, her real name is Shohu Miano

74
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,908
she was a member of the black suits gang

75
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,818
but to escape from them...

76
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:34,868
she forced herself to eat the same medecine
I ate before, so her body shrank

77
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,608
that's why
I'm not a high school detective anymore

78
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:41,748
but elementry school detective instead

79
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,328
I solved a lot and tough cases

80
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:49,888
in addition to learn more about
black suits gang

81
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,048
when I think of my uncle...

82
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:56,168
you better ply more
to enhance yourself

83
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,548
even after my body shrank
my brain still the same

84
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,428
detectives never surrenders

85
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,828
because the truth is always there

86
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,508
wow very huge

87
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:27,428
ofcourse

88
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,148
Yashiro's companies group
is very huge

89
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:36,248
it's the first luxurious trip
for Yashiro's group

90
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,458
so expect to see more

91
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:41,628

92
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,968

93
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:45,286

one minute please,
I'll ready your table right now

95
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,668
Prof. Agasa, what is this?

96
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:59,554
this... it's a voice recorder

97
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:03,768
I want to record any idea come to my mind

98
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:06,708
yeah, by the way, speaking of new inventions

99
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,108

100
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:11,598

101
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,938

perfect timing, I'll take it

105
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,664
but..

106
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:27,838
hey brat, this only suits
a great man like me

107
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:31,008
too early for a brat like you to wear it

108
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,778
but father, it's...

109
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,478
don't worry Ran

110
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:38,658
I don't think I'll use it inside this ship

111
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,159
Mr. Muri

112
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,918

also she's the one who named this ship aphrodite

122
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:10,108
(Minako Akayushi 32 years old Ships Engineer)
I'm Akayushi, glad to meet you

123
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,558

124
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:15,374
she's beautiful

125
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,684
yes

126
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:18,338
excuse me Mr. Muri

127
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,737
sorry for taking long, your table is ready

128
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:23,899
excuse me

129
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,964
can you add two more chairs

130
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,812
if you don't mind Mr.Muri

131
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,349
follow me please

132
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,898
uncle acting weird

133
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:38,464
why you think so?

134
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,438
you know the normal uncle will say:

135
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:44,358
"aphrodite godess of beauti"

136
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,908
"this name suits you more"

137
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,178
he would say this usually

138
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:58,428
I think because she looks like my mother

139
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,904
is that so

140
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,208
she looks like her indeed

141
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:07,868
so that's the type of women he afraids of

142
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,004
actually...

143
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:18,308
I write story takes a place
in a luxurious sea trip

144
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:21,544
that's why I made interview
with miss Minako. right?

145
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:22,751
yes

146
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,978
I see

147
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:27,698
by the way Mr. Muri,
did you receive invitation also?

148
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:31,048
or you came to explore something?

149
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:34,574
actually, about the invitation...

150
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,458
sorry, we didn't receive any?

151
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,544
didn't receive anything?

152
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:42,238
who received the invitation
are Sonoko's parents

153
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:46,148
her father is the president of Suzuki company

154
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,758
actually my parents have a lot of work

155
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,198
that's why I'm here

156
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:56,103
it's not fun coming alone
that's why I asked them to come along

157
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:59,918
we got 8 more tickets that way

158
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,774
I get it now

159
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,688
we are more like a kinder garden

160
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:07,691
I see...

161
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,698
ok then

162
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,228
which type of stories you write?

163
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:16,808
is it about a sea cruise around the world?

164
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:18,454
intresting

165
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:19,705
that's right

166
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:24,508
or is it like Titanic
which sank at first cruise

167
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:26,778
what are you saying Ai?

168
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,218
by the way

169
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:36,368
I heared one of Yashiru's ships sank
after crashing into iceberg

170
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:39,698
true, that was at winter 15 years ago

171
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:43,318
they say it was the captian mistake

172
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:48,238
one of the crew members died there
and the captian sank along with the ship

173
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,785
really?

174
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,908
what if this ship sink also? what will we do?

175
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,538
I only can swim for 7 meter

176
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,028
don't worry

177
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,921
Aphrodite's captian is very profitional

178
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,564
and there is no icebergs in this area

179
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:03,642
if the ship sink...

180
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,386
the first one to save is...

181
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,347
those people

182
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,688
isn't this constructing minister Neimi

183
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,398
and his wife too

184
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,144
also celebrities

185
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:23,738
the famous actresses, I'm very lucky

186
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:28,713
those two actress are the guest of honor
Yashiro's president invited them.

187
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:33,126
talking about them...
Mr. Yashiro and his daughter are here.

188
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,128
lady Takai,
she's the manager of Ships constructions factory

189
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:43,878
about that, Takai's husband died
lately in a car accident

190
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,300
really

191
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,888
yes, Hedito Yashiro

192
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:52,021
he was my mentour,
and the chief of the ship development

193
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,001
is that so...

194
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,878
I heard he got heart attack
while he was driving his car

195
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,457
and fell under the hill

196
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,158
it's the captain

197
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,181
wonderful

198
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,947
he's the captain, Watru Kaido

199
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,491
he was the vice captain of that ship

200
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:17,482
which sank 15 years ago
that we talk about earlier

201
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:20,572
a mistake?

202
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,552
you mean Hedito Yashiro's accident?

203
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:28,768
Yes, before the heart attack
while he driving under the hill

204
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,946
but...

205
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:34,252
it was an accident,
as the local police department said

206
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,252
but I still think...

207
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:40,954
Ok, no harm reviewing a case
if you feel there something wrong

208
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:44,222
I'll call the local police to inform them
about your arrival

209
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,346
thanks

210
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:49,368
Sato, do you need help?

211
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:51,532
but you didn't finish your report yet

212
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,972
Shiba... will you come with me?

213
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:56,531
yes

214
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,122
now before we drink...

215
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:11,282
leave it to me uncle

216
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:17,482
for this wonderful trip

217
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:18,958
and...

218
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,542
to congratulate Ran for winning
at eastern Japan championship

219
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,132
cheers

220
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,992
cheers

221
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,842
thank you... you Sonoko..

222
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:37,458
you know Ran?

223
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,658
winning the Karate championship
is really amazing

224
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,758
also it's the eastern region finale

225
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:45,522
your amazing, amazing, amazing

226
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:49,562
tell me, what did Kodu gave you as a present?

227
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,247
Shinichi?

228
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,488
when I told him he said..

229
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,552
"Really? cool"

230
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:57,092
what? is that all?

231
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:00,822
he's busy solving tough cases

232
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:02,412
that detective maniac

233
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:07,682
didn't I say a lot of "grats" as Conan

234
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,422
I'm full

235
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:16,618
that stakes was delicious

236
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,568
I wish if I could eat delicious food everyday

237
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,672
dessert supposed to be next

238
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:23,369
what is it?

239
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,668
I feel dizzy because the sea

240
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,518
I'm dizzy too

241
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,312
dad, you are drunk

242
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,422
you act like mothers

243
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,352
your father is cool

244
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,812
no, he's just crazy

245
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:43,388
excuse me I'll go to my room
to get some rest

246
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,768
are you really ok?

247
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,332
I have a medicine at my room, see ya

248
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:48,952
take care

249
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,862
dad, are you okay?

250
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,692
Muri is fine

251
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,252
don't worry Ran

252
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:39,742
all he need is some rest

253
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,418
sorry

254
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:44,242
so Conan, will you take care of him for me?

255
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:45,522
sure

256
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,259
Prof. Agasa, forgive me

257
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:49,038
don't worry

258
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:50,852
don't worry

259
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,922
good night Ran

260
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:57,452
the door is open, Agasa

261
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:02,052
we'll come too

262
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:07,602
- so Conan, will you...
- take care of him for me

263
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,767
huh?

264
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,032
sorry for inconvenience

265
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,386
what are you all doing here?

266
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:24,352
we are deciding which present to give Ran
to congratulate her

267
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:25,588
what is this?

268
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:29,272
isn't it pretty?
we collected it from the beach this morning

269
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:32,482
we are planning to make a medal
and give it to Ran

270
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,551
it's so sad Shinichi didn't send her a present

271
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:42,032
good luck... i'll take a shower

272
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,344
you're taking a shower?

273
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:46,743
what? would you like to join me?

274
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:48,372
no

275
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,532
let me confirm your schedule for tomorrow

276
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:01,532
breakfast at 7 am

277
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,262
I'll order a western food to your room

278
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08,302
lady Takai will play tennis with miss
Neimi at 9 am

279
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,672
I've already reserved it at the 7th floor

280
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:14,252
president Yashiro will play snooker
at 9 am

281
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:17,372
I've already reserved it at the 3rd floor

282
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:22,532
after playing tennis lady Takai will
return to her room at 9:30 am

283
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:44,972
how refreshing

284
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:49,892
drinking tea under the sea breeze like this

285
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,932
no doubt it's wonderful

286
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,752
yeah, it's wonderful

287
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,802
it's wonderful

288
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:13,088
did you see it? lady Takai's legs

289
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,492
doesn't look like a late 50 years old legs

290
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,068
Dad, what are you saying it's still morning?

291
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,182
Prof. Agasa, isn't it about time?

292
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,298
time for the quiz?

293
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:31,002
sooner or later you'll say it eventually,
just spit it now

294
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,772
this is really offending

295
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:38,302
ok, I'll give you an easy quiz...

296
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:41,102
it's about this sea cruise

297
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:45,962
let's presume Ginta went to the infirmary...

298
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,322
what is the reason for that?

299
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:55,452
1- His stomach injured because he ate a lot.

300
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:59,788
2- stumbled and injured his leg.

301
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:04,082
3- He got sun burns after
taking sun bath for a long time.

302
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,892
ok, which one is the right answer?

303
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:12,622
if we are talking about Ginta,
the correct choice will be the 1st one

304
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,412
no that's impossible

305
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,848
my stomacach will never be injured
even if I ate too much

306
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,910
I got it

307
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,271
me too

308
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:24,608
however,
isn't this quiz very hard for the children

309
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:25,668
the Eng...

310
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:26,982
Sonoko

311
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,242
English? will English help us to solve it?

312
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:32,142
Ship is another tip

313
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,192
Ship?

314
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:36,692
I know

315
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,822
the answer is 2-injured his leg

316
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,932
we are now on the ship

317
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:43,532
and Ginta will put bondage on his injured leg

318
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,232
that's right

319
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,948
the word "friendship" contains "Ship"

320
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,922
also "Gosship" contains "Ship"

321
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,752
it's "Gossip"

322
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,702
ok see you at 10 o'clock

323
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,888
then bondage in English is "Ship"

324
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,998
Mitso, it's dangrous to use bondages

325
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,362
while in sea cruise

326
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:05,788
why is that?

327
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,408
your brain is really slow

328
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:10,332
right, when to give Ran her present?

329
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,242
we can give it to her now

330
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,212
how about it?

331
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,342

332
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,638

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,043

334
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,342

335
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,498

336
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,592

337
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,312

338
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:40,158

339
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:42,132
what is this noise?

340
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:13,122
I know the secret behind
what happened 15 years ago

341
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:16,462
meet me at the depository 10:15

342
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:32,892
I see, it happened here,
in the street near the house

343
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:37,492
let's go to the house and take a look

344
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:43,012
ok, what to do now?

345
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,992
we can't swim, the weather still cold

346
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,862
ok, I'll go change my clothes

347
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,792
change your clothes?

348
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,892
actually.. the two actress invited me

349
00:23:57,452 --> 00:24:00,832
they asked me to tell them about the stories
of the famous detective Mori

350
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,502
bye

351
00:24:03,462 --> 00:24:05,182
uncle is great

352
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:07,532
when did he get the date?

353
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:10,798
forget about him

354
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,725
how about it, shall we play?

355
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:16,489
want to play hide and seek

356
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:18,196
it will be entertaining

357
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:19,464
let's play

358
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:21,882
hide and seek, it brings some memories

359
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,782
we played it a lot when we were kids

360
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,992
we were playing at car parks and gardens

361
00:24:27,322 --> 00:24:29,632
we used to play it at elementry school too.

362
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,212
really?

363
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,122
sorry, pass.

364
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:36,262
come on Conan

365
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:38,122
you are so boring.

366
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:41,672
As I remembered Shinichi also said "I pass"

367
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:44,182
let's play hide and seek

368
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,702
ok, it maybe fun

369
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:49,178
Prof. Agasa?

370
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:51,408
I have massage appointment

371
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:53,138
liar old geezer

372
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,870
ok, let's say the rules

373
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:57,992
time limit 30 minutes

374
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,792
we can hide from the first floor
to the 7th floor

375
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:06,912
hiding in deposite, cabins and bathrooms
are not allowed

376
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:08,154
ok?

377
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:09,802
ok

378
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,262
then gather everyone

379
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:15,282
rock, paper, scissors

380
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,862
it decided

381
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:22,602
wait, I can't, I can't

382
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:25,848
how can I find 6 persons in 30 minutes
on a ship with this size

383
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,592
I'll definitly lose

384
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:31,462
ok, we'll put another rule, choose another person

385
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:33,418
there will be two.

386
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:35,268
why not, let's try this new rule

387
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:37,202
let's play

388
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,918
let's do our best

389
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,227
sure

390
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:46,498
what a couple they make!

391
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:49,702
oh yeah, give me your detective badge

392
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:51,403
why?

393
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:54,612
Since there is two of us
we wouldn't know who catch who

394
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:57,219
that's why we will use the badge
to communicate

395
00:25:57,912 --> 00:25:59,578
don't drop it.

396
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,692
ok let's start at 9:50

397
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:05,708
if you find us all
before 10:20 you'll win

398
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,528
alright, I will win for sure

399
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:13,032
sorry but we will win...

400
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:15,022
because Conan with us

401
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,072
how can you say that?

402
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:18,792
ok let's go

403
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,652
let's start

404
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,662
I'll find you soon enough

405
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:29,928
do you think Ran will find it?

406
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:32,652
she will find it while playing

407
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,022
and she will be surprised

408
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:39,708
good

409
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:40,932
catch it

410
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:45,150
this is not a good place for hiding

411
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:48,102
when the movie show start?

412
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:49,718
10 o'clock

413
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:54,362
it's better to go now

414
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:13,790
I missed it

415
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:22,423
good

416
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:41,772
I can't believe the choice fell on me

417
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:45,852
sometimes it's not that bad
to search for other people.

418
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:48,366
5 minutes passed

419
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:51,998
I'll start from the 5th floor
you take the rest

420
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:54,230
ok

421
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,792
Kodu

422
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:01,568
Hi Ai

423
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:06,122
do you know that
you still playing hide and seek

424
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:14,472
ok, found one

425
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,828
how did you know I'm here

426
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:21,292
a person like you will only hide in a resturant

427
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,205
Ai

428
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,392
didn't you get this clothes from Agasa

429
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:40,042
this makes you more obvious

430
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:43,086
ok, come on out

431
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,592
I thought it's a nice place for hiding

432
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:50,712
not enough, you need 10 years to
defeat me in this game

433
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:01,992
yes, Akayoshi speaking

434
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:04,542
hi miss Minako, it's me Kasaka

435
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,052
let's start, first the cast members...

436
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,622
Nanami Okashi, 22 years old

437
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,072
a hostess works on a classy cruise

438
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,912
I'll read the story now...

439
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,822
Nanami Okashi, likes the ocean

440
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:38,052
maybe because she born and raised near the sea

441
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:41,412
more importantly
she likes the opening of the ocean

442
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,202
even though we found 4 of them very easily...

443
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:45,632
we still didn't find
the person who know how to hide

444
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,022
is Ran really that good?

445
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,158
she's like Ninja, Ninja

446
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,812
there is no normal person hang on ceiling
or hide under water

447
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,192
ceiling?

448
00:30:57,562 --> 00:30:59,582
under water?

449
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:07,462
she was very vibrant since childhood

450
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,552
let's find her, we still have 12 minutes

451
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,312
she's not here also

452
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:31,172
10:11
means 9 minutes left

453
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:53,742
hi, I'm Muri

454
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:08,762
I'll avenge my father

455
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:58,215
countdown

456
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,384
5..4..3..2..1..0

457
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:06,929
we won

458
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,848
all that because of Ran

459
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,098
yeah

460
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,425
Ran

461
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,380
you see, we won

462
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:17,722
Ran, where did you hide?

463
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,972
Conan, didn't you play soccer all the time

464
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:23,142
I know everything

465
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,842
I think Ran didn't get it yet

466
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,282
strange

467
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,223
is she really that bad at finding stuff

468
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,522
she still searching?

469
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:41,782
what? the floor is cold? what's happened?

470
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,812
box? I'm inside a box?

471
00:33:53,372 --> 00:33:57,162
no, anyone, anyone help me?

472
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:03,042

473
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,279

474
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:05,941

475
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:08,169

476
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:10,642

477
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:15,828

478
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:18,222
Wait Sonoko say that again I can't hear you

479
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:24,972

00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:30,132

481
00:34:30,762 --> 00:34:33,862
cold Sonoko, is it cold there?

482
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,416
locked inside a box

483
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:38,506
inside a fridge

484
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,062
what are you doing here?

485
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,068
where is the fridge?

486
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,138
the fridge?

487
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:49,532
please, my friend she's in danger

488
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:51,612
downstairs at the second floor

489
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,145
there is a lot of boxes

490
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:00,238
where is she?

491
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:01,718
let's split and search

492
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:02,648
ok

493
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:05,421
Sonoko

494
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:09,081
Sonoko

495
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,198
Sonoko, are you there?

496
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:14,722
where are you Sonoko?

497
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:17,692
let's go seems she's not here.

498
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:21,332
very cold

499
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:23,782
Sonoko, Sonoko

500
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:27,542
damn, where is she?

501
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,728
maybe she don't answer
cause she's already dead

502
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,932
don't say things like that

503
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,822
but where is the other cold place?

504
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,522
dead!.... there

505
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,902
there is a Mortuary in this ship?

506
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:45,917
what a surprise

507
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:49,978
it's heavy

508
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:55,883
Sonoko

509
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:00,898
Sonoko

510
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:02,712
hurry take her to the infirmary

511
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,187
Thank god

512
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:09,732
don't worry

513
00:36:10,052 --> 00:36:12,928
warm yourself and rest your body

514
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:14,672
you'll be alright

515
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:16,792
thank you very much

516
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:18,819
thank god your alive Sonoko

517
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,670
however...

518
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,420
what kind of joke is this?

519
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:25,552
joke? this is not a joke

520
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,972
someone tried to kill her

521
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:30,102
call the police right now

522
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:31,602
understand

523
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:35,592
tell me exactly what happened?

524
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,262
where did it happened?

525
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:40,438
I went to search for Ran inside the depository

526
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:43,012
then someone hit my back with a rod

527
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:45,242
then I fainted

528
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:46,882
how was he look like?

529
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:51,242
I think I saw him... but I forgot

530
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,405
how about the time?

531
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,512
I remember 10:11

532
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:58,322
10:11

533
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:03,198
I see, she's been attacked here

534
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,492
near the Mortuary

535
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:08,882
but why she's been attacked?

536
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,028
that's...

537
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,412
it's Yashiro's steel fan

538
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,551
why is it here?

539
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:29,979
nobody

540
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,782
Mr. Muri, the captain called the police

541
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,702
excuse me, it's Yashiro's room

542
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:40,652
yeah, the pretty actresses told me.

543
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,132
I remember, someone left this room lately

544
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,178
who was he?

545
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,052
didn't see his face

546
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:53,222
he was wearing a suit with hat

547
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:55,019
when?

548
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:57,772
almost about 10:15

549
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,672
are you sure Mr. Muri

550
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:04,722
strange, they don't like wearing the suits

551
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:08,772
this time only lady Takai should
be alone inside

552
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:17,682
walking in the hall wearing suit and hat
like he didn't want others to see him

553
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,348
could it be something happened to the lady?

554
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:24,112
lady, it's Sigimoto, lady

555
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:26,482
don't you have a master key

556
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:27,829
but...

557
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,708
lady, excuse us

558
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:38,772
lady

559
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,660
don't move, stay where you are

560
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:51,428
it couldn't be...

561
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:52,977
who did it?

562
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,582
she died before 30 minutes

563
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,122
I'll call the captain

564
00:38:57,492 --> 00:39:00,352
I'll tell the president

565
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:04,392
she's been stabbed after taking a shower

566
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:12,972
the blood cleaned here

567
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:16,632
why? why it's only cleaned here?

568
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,032
what are you doing brat?

569
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:23,552
ahhhh...

570
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:25,080
really

571
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:26,432
Mr. Muri

572
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:33,238
miss Neimi said president Yashiro left
after playing a game and never came back

573
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:34,781
what?

574
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:40,922
maybe president Yashiro involved in this case

575
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,338
welcome

576
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,118
Mr. Muri

577
00:40:05,142 --> 00:40:06,672
thanks for coming inspector

578
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:09,242
did you find president Yashiro?

579
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,413
we don't have any idea about his location

580
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:15,620
the crew members still searching for him

581
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,158
but by the way...

582
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,702
highr in mountin or deep in the sea
cases alwayes chasing you

583
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,716
is your next step up in the space?

584
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,225
do you need a rocket to launch?

585
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:25,872
how could it be?

586
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:45,702
what? Yashiro's fingers prints?

587
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:51,142
Yes, the location was near the blood marks
and the hatch

588
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:56,782
the blood marks there matches
his blood type

589
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:00,542
thanks, keep looking

590
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:01,982
also inspector...

591
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,442
as the crew members saying...

592
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:08,532
seems the hatch opened then closed

593
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:10,272
it happened in a short time

594
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,602
what?

595
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:16,422
Fingers prints blood marks and hatch opened.

596
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,998
inspector, it looks...

597
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:23,192
it looks like president Yashiro
been attacked there.

598
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:26,092
then thrown to the sea from that hatch

599
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:29,102
it's a possible presumption.

600
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:30,592
yes, you are right

601
00:41:31,062 --> 00:41:33,842
Shiratory, call the the coast guards...

602
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:35,932
ask them to search the area

603
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,120
alright

604
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,258
Takagi

605
00:41:38,282 --> 00:41:39,328
yes

606
00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:41,798
I want to speak with miss Neimi

607
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:42,828
ask her to come here

608
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:43,810
sure

609
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,288
ok Conan

610
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:49,288
yes

611
00:41:49,562 --> 00:41:53,082
go to your room, we'll take care of the rest

612
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:56,042
stay at your room and never leave it
under any reason

613
00:41:56,709 --> 00:42:00,418
the killer still out somewhere

614
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:01,720
ok

615
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:10,658
it's cake

616
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:11,982
look delicious

617
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:16,139
stakes

618
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:22,156
small piece won't harm.

619
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,489
even small piece will harm you

620
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:28,808
right prof. Agasa

621
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:31,612
we will take some to Ran and Sonoko

622
00:42:32,072 --> 00:42:34,162
they must be hungry now

623
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:37,872
No, leave it to the doctor
he knows what best for her

624
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:40,358
and Ran said she will eat later

625
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:41,912
and not to worry about her

626
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,188
really?

627
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:44,438
Mitsu

628
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,478
do you think she got the present?

629
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:49,168
I don't think she's in a good mood for that

630
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,268
yeah

631
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,308
where is Conan?

632
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,738
yeah he's not around

633
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:59,514
do you think he's listening
to the police investigations

634
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:00,876
maybe...

635
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:04,365
he know how to play
that kind of hide and seek game

636
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:07,386
thanks for the help

637
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:12,028
I hope you catch the killer very soon

638
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:13,159
yes

639
00:43:19,382 --> 00:43:23,822
let's say lady Takai returned to
her room after a game of tennis

640
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,232
then murdered after taking a shower

641
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:33,432
this means that guy wearing the suit
which Mr. Muri saw at the hallway

642
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:38,362
then, let's presume
that guy went to the depository

643
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:42,852
and killed president Yashiro there.

644
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:44,992
it makes sense now

645
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:47,922
so, it's very possible these...

646
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:51,282
these two crimes done by one person

647
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:56,462
Mr. Muri, how the killer looks like?

648
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:59,472
170 cm tall I guess

649
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:01,842
his body almost skinny

650
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:06,192
we can't define the sex by the tall only

651
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:11,502
Yes, lady Takai was at the same tall

652
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:15,162
miss Sigimoto is this the suit?

653
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:16,298
yes

654
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:20,261
it's a present given to all passengers

655
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:22,742
but anyone can have...

656
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:25,482
even the crew can get it very easily

657
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:29,542
Shiratory,
what is the motive behind these crimes?

658
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:32,072
it must be revenge or hatred

659
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:36,399
the victims wallets
and jewelleries not touched

660
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:40,112
even the door knob not broken

661
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:44,345
that means the victim
invited the killer into her room

662
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,872
or the killer used
the master key to sneak in

663
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:51,282
Mr. Misaki, who's else have the master key?

664
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:53,502
a lot

665
00:44:54,187 --> 00:45:02,437
security guards, hosts, and miss Natsu
have one cause she's on charge for this trip

666
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:03,928
I see

667
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:08,322
inspector, the killer was waiting
for the right time for the victim to be alone

668
00:45:08,782 --> 00:45:13,392
If that's the truth maybe the killer
knew about their schedule

669
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:20,427
Miss Sigimoto , since you are
their secretary did you know their schedule

670
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,742
yes

671
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,882
who's else know the schedule?

672
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:27,942
I told security chief Misaki about it

673
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:30,212
but I didn't tell anyone else.

674
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:35,542
that means if you are taller by 10 cm

675
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:38,572
or Mr. Misaki was less 10 kg weight.

676
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,892
you would be the first suspects

677
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,322
and there's another case

678
00:45:44,652 --> 00:45:49,562
- Sonoko's case
- I wonder if it's connected to these two

679
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:54,802
by the way, you walked near the killer

680
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:56,492
but didn't see his face

681
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,448
ok, I was...

682
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:00,822
however inspector...

683
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,252
it's a ship in a middle of ocean

684
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:06,322
I'm sure the killer still on board

685
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:11,874
if we add the crew members to the passengers,
we'll get 600 suspects

686
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:14,968
anyway Takagi

687
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:17,722
try to find any witnesses among the passengers

688
00:46:17,962 --> 00:46:19,044
ok

689
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:21,368
miss Sigimoto

690
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:24,268
please tell me more about crew and passengers

691
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:25,614
sure

692
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:29,732
That's right
Shiratory is right

693
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:32,942
how did the killer know their schedule?

694
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:37,032
miss Natsu didn't tell anyone about it

695
00:46:38,702 --> 00:46:39,671
she's...

696
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:43,252
that's right, if he used...

697
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,302
can I ask you something aunt

698
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:49,098
Conan?

699
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:52,132
you brat, from where...

700
00:46:56,222 --> 00:47:00,478
did you read to Mr and lady yashiros the
schedule last night at their room?

701
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:05,602
Yes after dinner, I went to their room
and read it to them

702
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:09,962
was there a time the room
was empty last night?

703
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:14,758
ok, last night president Yashiro said he's tired

704
00:47:14,782 --> 00:47:17,082
so after dinner he went to sleep

705
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:20,602
the only time there was no one inside
the room, was at dinner time

706
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:22,188
that's it

707
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:24,768
you...

708
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:28,711
didn't you hear what I just said?

709
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,152
it hurts

710
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:37,892
Mr. Misaki did someone
miss his dinner last night?

711
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,732
I think everybody was there

712
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:45,042
then the killer is one of the crew members

713
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:51,392
excuse me I'll go to my room
to get some rest

714
00:47:54,102 --> 00:47:57,552
aunt, did Mr Kasaka make an interview with you?

715
00:47:58,082 --> 00:48:00,772
Mr. Hiranatori Kasaka, ofcourse he did

716
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:04,312
is it possible that you lost one of
your master keys then

717
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:08,642
stop, how could something like this happen?

718
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:10,352
ok actually...

719
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:14,612
we lost a master key before 3 weeks

720
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,518
really?

721
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:18,698
as Conan said...

722
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:21,018
it happened right after the interview
with Kasaka

723
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:25,522
wait a minute, who's this Kasaka guy
you are talking about

724
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:29,392
he's ascenario writer,
made interview with us several times

725
00:48:29,902 --> 00:48:31,180
I see

726
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:35,368
Conan, is there anything suspecious about him?

727
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:39,332
yes, Mr Kasaka went to his room at dinner time

728
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:41,052
he said he dizzy because of the sea

729
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:44,108
but I think he sneak to the Yashiros room

730
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,488
and listened to what they said

731
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:48,728
fool, he's not a kid like you.

732
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:50,712
how can he listen to them?

733
00:48:50,992 --> 00:48:52,545
microphone

734
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:58,042
maybe he plant a microphone inside

735
00:48:58,322 --> 00:48:59,688
that's it then

736
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:03,232
what do you think Muri
what Kasaka looks like?

737
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:06,712
ok, he's the same as the one I passed by

738
00:49:07,272 --> 00:49:09,962
good, let's pay Mr. Kasaka a visit.

739
00:49:15,382 --> 00:49:17,462
that's it, microphone

740
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:21,292
not bad from the famous detective Muri

741
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:25,382
no that was because Conan idea

742
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:27,272
which led us to this point

743
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,432
I see.

744
00:49:30,732 --> 00:49:32,582
but you are wrong

745
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:35,022
because at 10:15

746
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:38,162
I was speaking to miss Minako by phone

747
00:49:39,512 --> 00:49:41,372
do you mean miss Minako who designed this ship?

748
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:46,122
yes, we are in a middle of ocean,
mobiles doesn't works

749
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:47,708
that's why I used the phone

750
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:49,698
how long does the call take?

751
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:53,302
from ten, about 30 minutes

752
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,542
you can investigate the call data

753
00:49:55,812 --> 00:49:58,020
that would be more accurate

754
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:01,442
what did you tell her at the phone

755
00:50:01,972 --> 00:50:03,790
if you don't mind telling us, of course

756
00:50:04,432 --> 00:50:08,052
we spoke about the story
and her opinion about it.

757
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,701
story?

758
00:50:10,032 --> 00:50:11,092
yes

759
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:14,482
I'm writing a story
taking a place in a sea cruise

760
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,422
I learned how ships works from her

761
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:29,642
love story in a sea cruise?

762
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:32,472
I'm still single

763
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:36,562
I don't want her to feel inconvenience

764
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:39,812
why you didn't speak to her directly?

765
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:41,482
you are at the same ship

766
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:43,902
she still single like me

767
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:46,122
meeting at her room is a bad idea

768
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:48,552
we could meet at cafe

769
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,412
but maybe someone hear us and steal the story

770
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:55,274
in our business we always take precautious steps

771
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,802
I see

772
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:05,362
I feel Mr Kasaka is innocent

773
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:09,282
we are not sure yet, we need more proofs

774
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:16,268
I'm thirsty

775
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:17,814
let's go drink something

776
00:51:19,892 --> 00:51:21,192
what is it Mr. Muri

777
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,452
did you like that chick?

778
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:27,492
she's really pretty

779
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:36,752
Mr. Misaki told me what happened

780
00:51:37,312 --> 00:51:41,002
ofcourse, Mr. Kasaka called me at 10 o'clock

781
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:42,722
and we spoke for 30 minutes

782
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:46,512
I promised to give him my opinion about his story

783
00:51:47,032 --> 00:51:48,532
he asked me during the tea time

784
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:52,282
he's about to finish it and he needs my opinion

785
00:51:52,972 --> 00:51:55,342
he said he will call at 10 o'clock

786
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,972
and asked me to wait

787
00:51:57,532 --> 00:52:01,002
that's it then, you confirm his side of story

788
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:02,902
sorry for inconvenience

789
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:17,122
at this case, Kasaka is not guilty

790
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:20,532
unless the two of them are guilty

791
00:52:21,232 --> 00:52:23,612
the phone he used is not wireless

792
00:52:24,172 --> 00:52:27,602
so he can't go to president
Yashiro while talking

793
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:33,392
what is it Mr. Muri

794
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,722
I'm sure he's thinking of miss Minako

795
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:39,812
he's right, she's hot.

796
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:45,872
- that means...
- yo experts

797
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:47,522
inspector Migury.

798
00:52:47,942 --> 00:52:49,268
how was it?

799
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:50,748
we searched the room

800
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:53,436
but we didn't find any clue

801
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,838
really

802
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:56,948
except the floor near the body

803
00:52:56,972 --> 00:53:00,778
there was a brown liquid trail

804
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,522
brown liquid

805
00:53:02,802 --> 00:53:04,982
it wasn't blood, Mr. Tomi

806
00:53:05,402 --> 00:53:09,432
nope, even though it looks like it

807
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:11,032
then thats...

808
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,316
inspector Migury

809
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:19,478
I asked everyone at 6th floor

810
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:21,748
but no one witnessed any crime

811
00:53:21,772 --> 00:53:23,255
really?

812
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:26,792
the welcome party will begin at 5 o'clock

813
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:31,738
let's ask more people before that time

814
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:32,788
ok

815
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:34,418
yes inspector...

816
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:38,012
we'll take these evidences to HQ

817
00:53:38,342 --> 00:53:39,362
thank you

818
00:53:52,672 --> 00:53:53,989
aunt

819
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,955
I was searching for you,
can I ask you something?

820
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:01,232
sure little detective

821
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,662
what is it?

822
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:05,632
what did Mr. Kasaka say to you at the phone

823
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:09,422
we talked much...

824
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:13,222
he was reading his story
and I was just listening

825
00:54:13,672 --> 00:54:15,112
just listening?

826
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:18,912
yes, he'll get angry if I intersect him

827
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:21,322
"Please shutup and listen".

828
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:24,382
it happened before

829
00:54:25,172 --> 00:54:27,762
that's why I'd never intersect him

830
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:31,008
so, before Kasaka finish his story...

831
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:32,482
you were just listening?

832
00:54:33,142 --> 00:54:34,388
that's right

833
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:38,758
then after 20 minutes
he asked me about my opinion

834
00:54:38,782 --> 00:54:40,922
I told him it was interesting

835
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:44,102
finished

836
00:54:44,862 --> 00:54:45,862
for you

837
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:47,022
thanks

838
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,620
how are you now Sonoko?

839
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,740
better

840
00:54:58,764 --> 00:55:02,158
if I knew that will happen
I wouldn't play that game

841
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:03,778
no problem

842
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:06,166
by the way, when we start the game

843
00:55:07,132 --> 00:55:09,592
sorry, but we will win...

844
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:12,232
what was you thinking about?

845
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:16,362
we used to play when we were kids

846
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:21,472
that day at the school
we were at the first year

847
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:24,212
we asked Shinichi to play with us

848
00:55:26,052 --> 00:55:28,002
Shinichi did you hear me?

849
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:30,048
Shinichi

850
00:55:30,072 --> 00:55:31,668
play hide and seek with us

851
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:33,338
it will be fun

852
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:35,239
sorry, pass

853
00:55:36,072 --> 00:55:37,832
soccer mach will begin very soon

854
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:39,552
how rude?

855
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:42,432
he's rude even when he was kid

856
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:45,122
so Shinichi didn't play with us

857
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:49,022
do you remember the store room
under the rostrum

858
00:55:50,332 --> 00:55:52,372
the place where they store the chairs in

859
00:55:53,582 --> 00:55:58,252
there was only one door behind the ladder

860
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,462
you hid there?

861
00:56:04,922 --> 00:56:07,972
Yes, I thought no one will finds me
if I hide there

862
00:56:08,442 --> 00:56:11,378
but the teacher passed by
and returned the ladder

863
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:12,908
so I couldn't get out

864
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:14,942
and then?

865
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:20,088
no one finds me so I couldn't get out

866
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:21,558
I was afraid at that time

867
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:24,642
but Shinichi found me very easily

868
00:56:27,362 --> 00:56:28,498
while we returning

869
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:32,628
I asked him how did he find me?

870
00:56:32,652 --> 00:56:34,443
"School Monsters"

871
00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:40,642
in that movie the kids who hid
inside the school got eaten by monsters

872
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,292
so the probability that
you could hide inside is zero

873
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:48,372
wait a minute,
how did you know I watched that movie?

874
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:53,192
you always look at the movie poster
every time we pass the movie store

875
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:55,442
and you always scares of monsters

876
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:58,012
that means you watched it for sure

877
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:03,532
so I figured that
you will hide outside the school

878
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:08,902
you will not hide in the pet farm
cause you like pets

879
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:12,902
the basketball team were cleaning...

880
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:16,232
so no way you could hide there.

881
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:19,902
swimming pool is at the entrance
that leaves only the rostrum

882
00:57:20,592 --> 00:57:23,052
that's why it's obvious

883
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:26,488
and when we took a class there...

884
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:28,132
you looked behind the ladder once

885
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:32,262
what? surprised?

886
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,622
Shinichi are you watching me all the time?

887
00:57:38,182 --> 00:57:40,312
stupid, why would I?

888
00:57:41,342 --> 00:57:42,452
your face turned to red

889
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:45,332
what are you saying?
It's because of the sunset

890
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:54,922
now I know

891
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:59,692
yesterday when you said
"it's the same as that time" you meant that

892
00:58:00,802 --> 00:58:02,372
and when you said before the game...

893
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:04,652
"sorry but we will win"

894
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:10,022
"the only one can find me is Shinichi"

895
00:58:10,262 --> 00:58:11,792
right?

896
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:14,892
- no it's not
- your face turned to red

897
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:17,422
what are you saying?
it's because of the sunset

898
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,382
uncle, what were you doing in Kasaka's room?

899
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:38,482
coming

900
00:58:40,802 --> 00:58:41,922
the little kid this time

901
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:43,892
came to play

902
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:50,652
I saw it before, this computer is magnificent

903
00:58:50,932 --> 00:58:52,922
yeah, I use it for work

904
00:58:57,602 --> 00:58:59,528
it's not a game for kids

905
00:58:59,553 --> 00:59:00,774
yeah

906
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:06,197
this machine is like the one Agasa have.

907
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:08,532
why can't I hear anything

908
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:10,325
hey kid

909
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:12,520
get out

910
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:16,562
it's impossible
that he still hold the evidence

911
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,962
our vacation ruined this time

912
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:39,348
why you say that Ginta?

913
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:40,882
it's serious this time

914
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:43,248
indeed

915
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:47,158
why always people hurts each other?

916
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:49,758
it would be great if everyone
can live happier ever after

917
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:50,903
it's impossible

918
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:53,942
every single human have feelings

919
00:59:54,912 --> 00:59:59,892
you can't feel what others feels
because it changes with time

920
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:02,462
pure relation will never change

921
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:06,252
but for some reasons, it may changes
into jealousy and hatred

922
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:08,852
that's when intention for killing appear

923
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:14,672
my parents always fight
but they still ok

924
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:19,102
that because they care for
each other, they love each other

925
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:23,518
Ai is right, sometimes...

926
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:27,082
people hurts each others

927
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:28,858
but to avoid all this...

928
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:32,332
we must think and care about others

929
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,002
to care for others?

930
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,893
prof. Agasa

931
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:41,722
I want you to lend me something

932
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,682
"Tama's westren side police department"

933
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,332
seat belt lock

934
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:00,232
come here Shiba

935
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:01,644
yes

936
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:04,652
have you found something?

937
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,213
take a look

938
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:08,722
this is the seat belt lock

939
01:01:09,182 --> 01:01:13,352
See the marks here as if something
were tide in it

940
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:19,002
right, looks like a kite's thread

941
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:22,662
a kite's thread?

942
01:01:28,112 --> 01:01:29,362
what are you doing here uncle?

943
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:32,682
where were you? the party about to begin

944
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:38,368
Mr. Muri, the inspector want to see you

945
01:01:38,392 --> 01:01:39,652
the inspector

946
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,220
ok

947
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:42,348
I'll come now

948
01:01:42,372 --> 01:01:44,473
stay here and wear your clothes

949
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:49,518
that's it then

950
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:52,535
there's some doubts about Hedito's accident

951
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:59,558
there is a mistake as miss Sato told us.
the marks in the seat belt lock

952
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,322
what do you think Mr. Muri?

953
01:02:03,912 --> 01:02:07,152
ok, nothing else?

954
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:08,568
right

955
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,642
a juice can and other useless stuff.

956
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:16,252
but it is garbage, nothing much.

957
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:20,602
juice can and kite's thread...

958
01:02:21,952 --> 01:02:22,972
if he use this

959
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:33,252
did I scare ya

960
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:35,112
you brat...

961
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:39,532
I wanted to use a cola can
to make a crack

962
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:41,362
but they don't sell cola here

963
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:43,272
you said cola?

964
01:02:44,402 --> 01:02:46,312
I almost got a heart attack

965
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:50,192
if he uses a can to do it...

966
01:02:50,752 --> 01:02:52,052
stun grenade...

967
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:57,282
maybe the killer used a stun grenade

968
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,678
ofcourse

969
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:02,238
what are you saying Shiratory?
Stun grenade...

970
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:04,992
stun grenade similer to flash bombs

971
01:03:05,422 --> 01:03:09,142
it makes a huge voice and light
they always use it to part demonstrators

972
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:12,572
it's a grenade with a size of the cola can

973
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:17,762
if the killer used the thread
to tide the grenade key

974
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:21,782
then attached the thread
with the seat belt and tide it to it's lock.

975
01:03:22,662 --> 01:03:25,552
when the victim pull the belt to tide it...

976
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:30,678
I see

977
01:03:30,702 --> 01:03:35,348
even if didn't got a heart attack
he will panic and can't drive

978
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:38,527
that's how the car fell from the hill

979
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,112
but it's not easy to get a stun grenade

980
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:49,902
nothing impossible these days with money

981
01:03:51,312 --> 01:03:54,512
unfortunatly everyone can buy some

982
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,322
since it's only used to scare others

983
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:01,042
they can use fireworks also

984
01:04:05,302 --> 01:04:08,182
inspector, a message from the coasts guards

985
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,122
they found a body
which they think it's president Yshiro's

986
01:04:14,962 --> 01:04:17,512
captain I want to speak with you

987
01:04:17,892 --> 01:04:18,888
what is it?

988
01:04:18,912 --> 01:04:23,363
about the party, I hope you cancel it

989
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:26,802
if the killer have more plans...

990
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:30,292
he may execute it and make chaos

991
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:32,462
but this...

992
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:34,412
please captain

993
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:36,122
no inspector

994
01:04:37,522 --> 01:04:39,512
we will not cancel the party tonight

995
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:43,312
everything will clear up then

996
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:45,612
don't tell me Muri you...?

997
01:04:45,842 --> 01:04:47,422
he started now

998
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:51,932
but he's not sleep yet

999
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:58,082
are you really ready for this uncle?

1000
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:19,572
ok let's enjoy

1001
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:21,892
I missed the fun for half day
it's better to begin now

1002
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:23,832
Sonoko, how you...

1003
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,698
let's tell Ran now

1004
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:29,182
ask her about it

1005
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:30,906
I think so

1006
01:05:31,832 --> 01:05:34,522
medal made from sea shells?

1007
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:38,112
but the thread was too short
so we made a bracelet

1008
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:40,448
that's mean you didn't find it

1009
01:05:40,472 --> 01:05:41,598
how disappointing

1010
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:44,212
sorry, I promise to search for it later

1011
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:48,572
thanks anyway, I'm really happy

1012
01:05:53,022 --> 01:05:56,022
welcome everyone onboard the Aprodite

1013
01:05:56,722 --> 01:06:02,712
I'm Natsu Sigimoto, the manager of this trip
I'll gladly start the party

1014
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:05,948
thanks everyone

1015
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:09,612
allow me to introduce the main staff
onboard this ship

1016
01:06:10,222 --> 01:06:12,492
first security chief Noya Misaki

1017
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:18,512
second doctor Mizo Kubo

1018
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:24,402
this is our chef Katsue Shiyumi

1019
01:06:26,952 --> 01:06:28,318
did you find the killer

1020
01:06:28,342 --> 01:06:33,352
yes but still don't have evidence

1021
01:06:34,652 --> 01:06:36,272
now everyone I'll introduce to you...

1022
01:06:36,642 --> 01:06:39,192
the captain Watru Kaido

1023
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:49,312
before the begining I want to introduce
the woman who designed this ship

1024
01:06:50,192 --> 01:06:52,692
Minako Akayushi

1025
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:06,172
I heared lady Yashiro murdered
is it true?

1026
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:09,412
there is another rumor
says president Yashiro is dead

1027
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:11,220
thats...

1028
01:07:11,412 --> 01:07:14,192
- you are police officers?
- did you catch the killer?

1029
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,122
is it safe to make a party now?

1030
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:22,838
silence please everyone, silence

1031
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:24,488
what happened exactly...?

1032
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:27,983
actually... Muri san?

1033
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:30,474
Muri san?

1034
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:33,364
please quiet everyone..

1035
01:07:33,912 --> 01:07:35,402
no need to worry now

1036
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:42,832
I know the truth behind these serial crimes
I'm the famous detective Muri

1037
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,522
I've waited for a long time, famous detective

1038
01:07:47,822 --> 01:07:53,342
first killed lady Takai
then killed president Yashiro

1039
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:55,416
the killer is...

1040
01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:59,353
you, miss Minako Akayushi

1041
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:06,748
the motive for your crimes is...

1042
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:09,418
revenge for the death of Hedito
who died in car accident

1043
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:14,722
the accident which done by
lady Takai and president Yashiro

1044
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:19,302
but why would she revenge Hedito's death?

1045
01:08:19,902 --> 01:08:24,402
probably because they secretly married

1046
01:08:24,812 --> 01:08:26,622
wait Mr. Muri

1047
01:08:27,322 --> 01:08:31,492
it's true that I respected Hedito as a tutor

1048
01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:33,632
but there is no relationship.

1049
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:35,578
add to this...

1050
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:39,882
there is a proof that
I was speaking with Mr. Kasaka at that time

1051
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:44,432
maybe that's right, but actually...

1052
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:49,552
you let Mr. Kasaka read the story
but you didn't say anything

1053
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:52,982
that's mean you don't have a proof

1054
01:08:53,382 --> 01:08:54,612
don't presists please

1055
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:59,738
what if Kasaka stop and talk to me?

1056
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,792
he would know I wasn't listening

1057
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:05,452
I'm not stupid to give a weak proof like this

1058
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,499
if you still think I'm the killer

1059
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:10,519
then show me the proof please

1060
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:15,159
that's right Muri, do you have proof?

1061
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:17,274
ah.... no...

1062
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:22,999
I can't believe my dad accused her
because she looks like mom

1063
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:24,899
so Mr. Muri...

1064
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:27,929
excuse me, it's bathroom time

1065
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:29,915
time?

1066
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:39,166
that's it

1067
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:43,369
inspector, now while everybody loughing
do something

1068
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:44,859
but...

1069
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:47,309
don't worry inspector Miguri

1070
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:49,789
because I know who did it

1071
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,909
are you sure Prof. Agasa

1072
01:09:52,499 --> 01:09:53,635
great

1073
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:55,889
now it's Prof. Agasa time

1074
01:09:56,409 --> 01:10:00,159
do everyone know the meaning of "Cruisder"?

1075
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:02,369
it means The theft of the pirates

1076
01:10:02,809 --> 01:10:07,219
that because pirates way
of hunting and chasing their preys

1077
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,419
there is a pirate on this ship

1078
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:19,699
he doesn't hunt money or jewelry
but souls, yes it's a pirate doing

1079
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:23,329
that pirate is the scenario writer
it's you, Kasaka Hiranatori

1080
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:28,699
strange, didn't you hear
what miss Minako just said?

1081
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:34,329
I have a proof I was reading the story
at that time

1082
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:36,739
is this is the story your talking about

1083
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:40,249
Nanami Okashi, likes the ocean

1084
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,899
maybe because she born
and raised near the sea

1085
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,169
more importantly she likes the opening
of the ocean

1086
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,449
it's an easy trick

1087
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:54,359
you played the tape which you recorded earlier

1088
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,509
and murdered the two of them while that time

1089
01:10:57,929 --> 01:11:00,059
impossible I got rid of it

1090
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,505
got rid of it?

1091
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:05,722
you may think so, but not

1092
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:11,279
you should clean your traces twice

1093
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,569
it's a fake evidence, right?...the tape.

1094
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,459
you recorded it using voice changer tie

1095
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:20,809
that's right

1096
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:24,889
but I have the perfect proof

1097
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:30,489
this is not a proof that I killed someone

1098
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,359
if you want a proof

1099
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,709
look there

1100
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,589
what's up uncle?

1101
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:40,999
there is a black color on your red hair

1102
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:45,179
could it be a blood?

1103
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:46,513
blood?

1104
01:11:47,824 --> 01:11:49,624
wait Mr. Kasaka

1105
01:11:49,929 --> 01:11:51,162
yes

1106
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:54,045
uncle, your hair color the same
as the blood color

1107
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:59,103
that's why you didn't notice it

1108
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:01,156
remember

1109
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:03,919
blood get dry very soon

1110
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,639
and color change

1111
01:12:07,819 --> 01:12:11,709
also, please remove the scarf you are wearing

1112
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:16,269
if I was right, there should be...

1113
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:22,709
some marks around your neck
caused by president Yashiro

1114
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,429
excuse me

1115
01:12:27,589 --> 01:12:31,939
can you come with me Mr. Kasaka?

1116
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:35,015
wait a minute, stop.

1117
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:36,289
I still have one more thing

1118
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:38,749
The winning card

1119
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:45,469
don't move or I'll blow up this ship

1120
01:12:45,759 --> 01:12:47,059
bombs?

1121
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:51,072
cooperate with me
if you don't want to sink this ship

1122
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:01,669
it's him, it's the guy who attacked me.

1123
01:13:02,889 --> 01:13:04,009
at last you remembered

1124
01:13:04,889 --> 01:13:08,065
please calm down
why you did all this?

1125
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:09,239
to avenge my father

1126
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:10,586
revenge?

1127
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:15,445
the man who died 15 years ago
aboard Yashiro's ship

1128
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:17,102
was my father

1129
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:21,405
yes, that...

1130
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:25,379
I learned about it
when I met a friend of my father 2 years ago

1131
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:29,029
there was a rumor about the accident

1132
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:35,459
Takai Yashiro who was the manager
and president Yashiro

1133
01:13:35,919 --> 01:13:39,439
they drowned the ship,
to get benefit from the securing sum

1134
01:13:40,369 --> 01:13:46,249
also they wanted to get rid of captain Okita cause
he always wanted to improve the crew situations

1135
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:49,039
they Have offered a bribe to the vice captain

1136
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:54,765
and you accepted it

1137
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:58,209
you forced the captain to sleep
after adding sleeping pills to his tea

1138
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:01,759
and you hit the iceberg to sink the ship

1139
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:08,199
at the same time you bombed the ship

1140
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:16,599
doesn't Hedito Yashiro the one
who told you where to plant it

1141
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:18,269
impossible? my teacher

1142
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:22,119
how did you kill president Yashiro?

1143
01:14:22,389 --> 01:14:25,479
he sat on me and tried to choke me

1144
01:14:25,759 --> 01:14:28,929
but I threw him out using a Judo technique

1145
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:32,929
now I wish I could do like you
and blow up this ship

1146
01:14:33,419 --> 01:14:36,659
then kill you inside the chaos

1147
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:38,749
in your dreams

1148
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,969
Wait
put the control down

1149
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,549
shut up, don't come near

1150
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:54,823
he disappeared

1151
01:14:56,854 --> 01:14:57,910
you'll not get away

1152
01:14:59,972 --> 01:15:01,204
- Conan
- after him

1153
01:15:23,429 --> 01:15:24,491
shit

1154
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:28,155
wait Conan

1155
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:29,264
wait for us

1156
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:30,809
you...?

1157
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:32,135
we will go too...

1158
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,749
we will not let Conan get all the credits

1159
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,321
Haiybra

1160
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,359
ok. that's the reason

1161
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:42,809
hold well now

1162
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:35,791
everyone to the left

1163
01:16:44,103 --> 01:16:45,529
to the right now

1164
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:52,299
we have passed him

1165
01:16:54,429 --> 01:16:55,499
I'm counting on you Ai

1166
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:22,569
Conan

1167
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:24,889
did you defeat him Conan?

1168
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:28,649
great

1169
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:32,749
the detective squad kids

1170
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:37,339
hey kids

1171
01:17:39,449 --> 01:17:41,509
are you ok?

1172
01:17:45,529 --> 01:17:47,099
You are careless

1173
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:50,209
this man is a murderer

1174
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:52,719
what if something bad happened?

1175
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:55,032
sorry

1176
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:07,559
inspector Miguri

1177
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:10,479
how many bombs did he plant?

1178
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:25,415
what is the sitiuation there Ezawa

1179
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,865
captain the bombs
made a several holes in the ship

1180
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:31,265
how about safty locks

1181
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:35,362
it's closed but the water already
inside third and fourth floors

1182
01:18:35,386 --> 01:18:36,386
what?

1183
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:39,198
captain, issue the order
to evacuate the ship immediatly

1184
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,058
captain

1185
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:45,569
evacuate... the ship

1186
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:51,709
to all passengers, I'm Eiyawa the navigator

1187
01:18:52,219 --> 01:18:56,809
please everyone wear the life jackets
and head directly to the lifeboats

1188
01:18:57,419 --> 01:19:01,489
this is not a training,
I repeat this is not a training

1189
01:19:02,179 --> 01:19:03,529
please take the emergency door

1190
01:19:04,179 --> 01:19:07,539
to all crew's guide the passengers
to the lifeboats

1191
01:19:12,299 --> 01:19:15,259
no, I couldn't find the medal

1192
01:19:15,769 --> 01:19:16,839
where is it?

1193
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:18,270
Ran

1194
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:20,365
Hurry up

1195
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:21,703
Ran let's go

1196
01:19:32,589 --> 01:19:35,699
don't worry we still have enough time

1197
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:37,649
walk in order

1198
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:40,469
father, where is Conan and the others?

1199
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:42,239
the kids are safe

1200
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:44,369
inspector Miguri told me...

1201
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:47,699
they chased Kasaka using a boat

1202
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,549
and they've been picked by a near ship

1203
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:52,348
thank god

1204
01:19:57,806 --> 01:20:01,559
Ran, you go on this boat

1205
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,409
I'll take another one later

1206
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:06,299
- but...
- later

1207
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:07,404
dad...

1208
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:10,109
don't panic, one after another

1209
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:16,689
lower the lifeboats and don't
let the tide take you down with it

1210
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:18,175
understand

1211
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,829
it's very hot here darling

1212
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:23,955
we don't have a choice at tough times like this

1213
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:27,689
but I can't take it anymore

1214
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:29,728
I remembered now

1215
01:20:29,974 --> 01:20:30,855
what?

1216
01:20:30,879 --> 01:20:32,645
I dropped it where I hide this morning

1217
01:20:32,669 --> 01:20:34,019
do you mean the medal

1218
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:36,865
I will lower the lifeboat now, please hang on

1219
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:38,419
I want to get out

1220
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:39,836
but Ran...

1221
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,835
go, I will catch you later

1222
01:20:41,859 --> 01:20:42,905
but...

1223
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:45,309
even if it's made by sea shells...

1224
01:20:45,869 --> 01:20:48,189
for me it's a very important treasure

1225
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:49,625
see you later

1226
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:51,011
wait Ran

1227
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:08,719
found it, so this is it

1228
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:24,859
we are lucky this ship was near

1229
01:21:25,329 --> 01:21:28,249
is everyone there ok?

1230
01:21:28,499 --> 01:21:29,649
I'm worry

1231
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:36,845
don't worry she'll be in the lifeboat

1232
01:21:36,869 --> 01:21:42,089
Kasaka said he wanted to scare us
so he could kill Kaidu

1233
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:46,029
but these bombs is too much

1234
01:21:46,789 --> 01:21:49,979
seems like he wanted to sink the ship

1235
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:53,319
and that proof

1236
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:55,249
it was very easy

1237
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:59,055
if miss Minako said anything...

1238
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:00,399
the plan will fail

1239
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,719
I think he tried it several times

1240
01:22:03,269 --> 01:22:06,869
to make sure she wouldn't intersect him

1241
01:22:07,109 --> 01:22:09,149
and to use it as a proof

1242
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:10,679
right, she said that also

1243
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:14,319
yes, he will get angry if I intersect him

1244
01:22:15,619 --> 01:22:16,692
inspector Miguri

1245
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,169
the coasts guards just informed me now

1246
01:22:20,589 --> 01:22:24,899
that president Yashiro been stabbed

1247
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:26,139
what?

1248
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:27,899
what this is mean?

1249
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,099
Kasaka didn't say he used a knife

1250
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,779
it was 10:11

1251
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:38,265
it was 10:15

1252
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:40,559
wasn't Kasaka

1253
01:22:41,349 --> 01:22:42,369
who did it then?

1254
01:22:43,089 --> 01:22:45,289
she don't look like a 50 years old woman

1255
01:22:53,779 --> 01:22:54,815
Conan

1256
01:22:54,839 --> 01:22:56,519
where are you going Conan?

1257
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,165
Conan

1258
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:01,761
no wonder...

1259
01:23:02,749 --> 01:23:04,389
no wonder I felt there was something wrong

1260
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:09,899
I have a feeling there's still something
might cost us a big loss

1261
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:12,339
are you talking about a crime

1262
01:23:12,889 --> 01:23:13,889
yes.... maybe

1263
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:16,319
maybe that

1264
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:21,174
Conan

1265
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:29,229
the case... are you really doing this
for the case Kudo kun?

1266
01:23:35,879 --> 01:23:38,429
if I'm not mistaken, the killer is...

1267
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:45,646
captain

1268
01:23:47,619 --> 01:23:49,709
all evacuated safely

1269
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:56,085
I'll take the last boat gather
everyone else and leave the ship

1270
01:23:56,109 --> 01:23:57,213
ok

1271
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,099
don't you wanna sink
along with the ship captain

1272
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:17,095
you? what are you still
doing here? leave now

1273
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:19,179
do you remeber this?

1274
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,519
my father loved it

1275
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:24,839
a paper ship?

1276
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,149
couldn't be...

1277
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:31,369
yes me, the captain's daughter

1278
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:35,589
whom you and Yashiro's killed 15 years ago

1279
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:41,109
sorry all the remaining lifeboats destroyed

1280
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:42,729
how could it be?

1281
01:24:42,969 --> 01:24:44,082
don't move

1282
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:46,649
the place is tight here

1283
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:52,921
let's go to a bigger place to speak
under the sea breeze

1284
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:16,539
it was before half year

1285
01:25:17,419 --> 01:25:20,899
Kasaka told me
he want to make interview with me for his story

1286
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,295
but he kept talkin about the Yashiros
which they don't have a relation in the story

1287
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:27,459
it was very fishy

1288
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:31,869
so I looked into his computer and found

1289
01:25:40,259 --> 01:25:43,409
the truth behind the ship accident

1290
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:48,019
that was Kasaka real intentions

1291
01:25:50,059 --> 01:25:51,439
I felt something wrong

1292
01:25:51,909 --> 01:25:53,949
that's why I visited Hedito Yashiro next day

1293
01:25:55,479 --> 01:25:59,725
he confessed everything
after I put alchool into his drink.

1294
01:25:59,749 --> 01:26:04,869
ship drowning wasn't an accident
but they planned it

1295
01:26:06,749 --> 01:26:09,439
he didn't know I'm Okita's daughter

1296
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:16,155
sorry, the president ordered me

1297
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:17,299
I don't want to hear excuses

1298
01:26:18,269 --> 01:26:20,799
I'll let join the Yashiros

1299
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:23,769
death is your destiny

1300
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:25,929
the same destiny as my father

1301
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:30,249
shit, I hope I could reach in time

1302
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,769
please, forgive me

1303
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:36,369
goodbye captain

1304
01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:45,069
stop

1305
01:26:49,879 --> 01:26:54,109
so you are the killer after all

1306
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:55,947
uncle

1307
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:57,542
stay there

1308
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:03,009
sorry, I messed your gun, it will not work

1309
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:09,679
during "bathroom time" I found it at your room

1310
01:27:14,759 --> 01:27:15,771
captain

1311
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:22,179
we will talk later

1312
01:27:25,509 --> 01:27:27,945
miss Akayushi, as I presumed...

1313
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:31,399
no need for that now, you will die here

1314
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:34,879
presuming on this sinking ship

1315
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:37,019
will not do you any good

1316
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:39,629
I will not give up easily

1317
01:27:40,749 --> 01:27:44,459
To find the truth that's how detectives works

1318
01:27:46,499 --> 01:27:52,749
I think you knew about Kasaka plan
to kill Hedito Yashiro

1319
01:27:53,419 --> 01:27:55,969
but there was weak points in his plan
could result in failure

1320
01:27:56,669 --> 01:28:02,539
that's why you killed Hedito at
the car accident before him

1321
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:06,039
using the stun grade

1322
01:28:08,589 --> 01:28:12,939
after Hedito's death,
Kasaka's targets decreased from 4 to 3

1323
01:28:13,269 --> 01:28:15,959
he used you to make a proof

1324
01:28:16,569 --> 01:28:18,089
but you knew all that...

1325
01:28:18,379 --> 01:28:23,149
so you used his plan to kill them
with your own hand

1326
01:28:23,629 --> 01:28:27,249
first, you and Kasaka planted
the bombs separately

1327
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:29,479
you designed this ship

1328
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:33,709
you knew the weak points
to make fatal holes

1329
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,139
at that morning 10 o'clock
you received a call from Kasaka

1330
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:41,409
when he started reading the story,
you went to Takai's room

1331
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:47,949
you knocked her while she was taking shower

1332
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:51,379
Then you wore her robe to disguise as her

1333
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:55,419
that's when Kasaka sneaked from behind
thinking you are her

1334
01:28:56,939 --> 01:28:59,969
you let him stab the...

1335
01:29:00,249 --> 01:29:03,749
blood bag which you were hiding inside the robe

1336
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:07,629
after Kasaka left thinking he succeeded

1337
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:10,189
you killed her

1338
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:14,949
then you cleaned the fake blood

1339
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,449
you wore the suit after that

1340
01:29:32,839 --> 01:29:38,699
at that time I thought you don't want me
to see your face that's why you rolled your body

1341
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:41,199
but I found the answer later

1342
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:43,759
the reason because your a woman

1343
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:47,315
your body rolled unvoluntary at that time

1344
01:29:47,339 --> 01:29:48,650
that's why

1345
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:53,905
like the other time

1346
01:29:57,489 --> 01:30:00,409
then you went to the depository

1347
01:30:00,849 --> 01:30:06,059
and you saw the president chocking Kasaka

1348
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:11,019
so you sneaked from behind
very fast and catch his legs..

1349
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:12,906
legs?

1350
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:19,239
yeah. you didn't touch his legs
you stabbed him from the back

1351
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:23,439
yes, you stabbed him using a knife

1352
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:33,599
then you hid yourself quickly

1353
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:36,219
that's how Kasaka thought he did it all alone

1354
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:38,909
everything went as you planned

1355
01:30:40,619 --> 01:30:43,539
you are really the famous detective Togo Muri

1356
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:49,919
I planned to use him as a pawn
after knowing you are here

1357
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:55,109
to fool the famous detective I need a pawn

1358
01:30:55,809 --> 01:30:59,819
and more importantly,
someone believe he did it

1359
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:08,259
also on his computer he described my father
as the stubborn old geezer who died with the ship

1360
01:31:08,999 --> 01:31:11,499
I shall never forgive who insults my father

1361
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:14,519
the one who shall never forgiven is you

1362
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:18,669
you didn't murder 3 persons only...

1363
01:31:19,179 --> 01:31:21,959
but you endangered the life
of innocents people

1364
01:31:22,329 --> 01:31:25,689
and drowned the ship you desiged
with your own hand

1365
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:28,289
I planned for everything
when I designed the ship

1366
01:31:28,799 --> 01:31:32,849
after bombs, water leaks, people escapes...

1367
01:31:33,409 --> 01:31:35,079
I found a solution

1368
01:31:35,549 --> 01:31:38,625
I'll force him to drown with the ship

1369
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:42,869
to make him suffer like my father,
lonely and hopeless

1370
01:31:45,609 --> 01:31:49,839
Aphrodite was born from the ocean bubbles

1371
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:52,389
and she will return to it someday as bubbles

1372
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,559
however since you know all this,
I don't have a choice

1373
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:00,239
but to surrender

1374
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:10,029
I will not hit a woman

1375
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,179
how romantic

1376
01:32:20,459 --> 01:32:21,477
uncle

1377
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:31,509
so, do you want to change your mind?

1378
01:32:32,189 --> 01:32:35,249
I will not fight you

1379
01:32:35,709 --> 01:32:37,879
those three are dead, quit it

1380
01:32:38,989 --> 01:32:42,239
it is because you are an obstacle on my way

1381
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:07,275
that kid...

1382
01:33:07,299 --> 01:33:08,065
Shinichi

1383
01:33:08,089 --> 01:33:09,035
huh?

1384
01:33:09,059 --> 01:33:10,551
no... nothing

1385
01:33:41,339 --> 01:33:43,329
it's time to end all this

1386
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:46,669
Mr. Muri

1387
01:33:57,649 --> 01:34:01,959
it's very shameful to see
a famous detective in a bad shape

1388
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:04,389
shut up

1389
01:34:21,809 --> 01:34:23,059
uncle

1390
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:42,459
I did not expect that

1391
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:46,589
I was your target from the begining

1392
01:34:47,869 --> 01:34:51,689
I think I look like someone you hate so much

1393
01:34:52,619 --> 01:34:53,819
not true...

1394
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:56,469
that because you look like her

1395
01:34:57,399 --> 01:34:59,629
I hoped that you are not the killer

1396
01:35:00,229 --> 01:35:02,489
that's why I kept searching
for a proof your not guilty

1397
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:04,439
but it ended like this

1398
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:08,129
uncle

1399
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:10,580
are you alright uncle?

1400
01:35:10,979 --> 01:35:13,200
that was a great conclusion uncle

1401
01:35:14,258 --> 01:35:16,328
how did you come here?

1402
01:35:16,676 --> 01:35:19,294
let's leave this place first

1403
01:35:19,665 --> 01:35:20,691
leave the place?

1404
01:35:20,851 --> 01:35:24,298
we can't all the lifeboats gone

1405
01:35:24,322 --> 01:35:27,102
and she's destroyed the rest

1406
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:31,029
captain... captain

1407
01:35:33,949 --> 01:35:35,177
hey captain

1408
01:35:35,532 --> 01:35:37,009
we're saved

1409
01:35:40,699 --> 01:35:42,570
what is? this feeling?

1410
01:35:42,969 --> 01:35:44,409
the case closed

1411
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,999
what? what this terrible feeling?

1412
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:56,049
hurry up, the ship will sink

1413
01:36:00,309 --> 01:36:02,399
go inside now

1414
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:09,379
what are you waiting for? hurry up

1415
01:36:12,419 --> 01:36:13,829
...Ran?

1416
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:17,039
Ran leaved the ship earlier

1417
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,819
uncle, isn't Ran with you?

1418
01:36:20,569 --> 01:36:21,999
what do you mean?

1419
01:36:22,519 --> 01:36:25,305
she went to where she hid before
to search for the medal

1420
01:36:25,329 --> 01:36:27,649
thats why I thought she was with you

1421
01:36:28,029 --> 01:36:29,190
this is the reason

1422
01:36:29,677 --> 01:36:31,584
wait

1423
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:53,389
where is Ran?

1424
01:36:57,189 --> 01:37:00,569
anyone? anyone hears me?

1425
01:37:08,609 --> 01:37:11,479
Ran, so you are really here

1426
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,359
Shinichi

1427
01:37:15,379 --> 01:37:16,769
you will find me

1428
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:19,423
Shinichi

1429
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:22,893
where is Ran?

1430
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:26,665
Ran knew I was playing soccer at that time

1431
01:37:26,689 --> 01:37:28,018
that means...

1432
01:37:30,379 --> 01:37:31,659
she must be upstairs

1433
01:37:34,856 --> 01:37:36,076
I will find you

1434
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,723
wait Ran, I will find you for sure

1435
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:46,336
where are you Ran?

1436
01:37:46,879 --> 01:37:49,489
calm down and think

1437
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:52,813
I easily found her that time

1438
01:37:56,032 --> 01:37:57,174
yes

1439
01:37:57,879 --> 01:38:00,035
how did you know where I am?

1440
01:38:00,059 --> 01:38:02,559
didn't you play soccer all the time?

1441
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:05,999
Conan, didn't you play soccer all the time

1442
01:38:06,419 --> 01:38:07,869
I know everything

1443
01:38:08,129 --> 01:38:10,399
it's like the last time

1444
01:38:10,909 --> 01:38:14,469
uncle, search for a place under the ground
which can be used to hide

1445
01:38:17,019 --> 01:38:18,127
here

1446
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,849
damn this stupid lock

1447
01:38:35,059 --> 01:38:36,309
uncle

1448
01:38:47,726 --> 01:38:48,876
we made a crack

1449
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:51,487
Ran are you there?

1450
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,060
father

1451
01:38:58,569 --> 01:39:01,099
we better hurry uncle

1452
01:39:01,571 --> 01:39:02,964
damn

1453
01:39:06,379 --> 01:39:07,769
this is bad, this is bad

1454
01:39:08,009 --> 01:39:10,989
hurry up and take the boat there
or everyone else will die

1455
01:39:11,409 --> 01:39:13,259
sorry, I can't do it

1456
01:39:13,589 --> 01:39:14,720
if we get near it now...

1457
01:39:14,744 --> 01:39:17,124
the tide will take us down

1458
01:39:17,149 --> 01:39:18,249
it can't be...

1459
01:39:23,809 --> 01:39:25,699
it's the rescue coasts guards helicopter

1460
01:39:25,939 --> 01:39:27,169
thank god

1461
01:39:33,435 --> 01:39:34,805
it's a helicopter

1462
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:37,861
shit

1463
01:39:37,885 --> 01:39:39,190
let's go to the front

1464
01:39:47,289 --> 01:39:49,025
we are here

1465
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:50,309

1466
01:40:05,149 --> 01:40:06,415
is everyone here

1467
01:40:06,439 --> 01:40:07,615
yes

1468
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:11,275
hang well boy, we will leave this place

1469
01:40:11,299 --> 01:40:12,440
ok

1470
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:23,309
hold on, ok?

1471
01:40:23,503 --> 01:40:24,465
ok

1472
01:40:24,489 --> 01:40:28,405
going up now, hold your daughter

1473
01:40:28,429 --> 01:40:29,752

1474
01:40:51,069 --> 01:40:52,089

1475
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:03,456

1476
01:41:06,571 --> 01:41:07,703

1477
01:41:24,839 --> 01:41:27,069
hold well Conan

1478
01:41:29,179 --> 01:41:30,419

1479
01:41:40,029 --> 01:41:41,050
hey kid

1480
01:41:42,839 --> 01:41:44,061

1481
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:02,231

1482
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:03,706
thanks

1483
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,339
the ship where your mother is very near

1484
01:46:10,582 --> 01:46:13,645
you knew she's the killer

1485
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:16,589
because Kasaka's proof was very easy

1486
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:20,849
that trick will only used to prove
he is innocent

1487
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:26,329
and also the other one can use it as
a provment for herself

1488
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:30,469
and who's possibly can disguise
as lady Takai with her beautiful legs

1489
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:33,919
must be someone with a beautiful legs

1490
01:46:34,439 --> 01:46:35,739
I see

1491
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:39,029
thank god you find Ran's hiding place

1492
01:46:39,349 --> 01:46:40,349
that because...

1493
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:43,365
my time to worry about you

1494
01:46:43,389 --> 01:46:46,105
actually I was playing soccer
with a volly ball

1495
01:46:46,129 --> 01:46:48,579
but Ran said I was playing football

1496
01:46:49,389 --> 01:46:53,579
that's why I thought she was hiding in place
where she can hears me but can't sees me

1497
01:46:54,139 --> 01:46:55,759
how disappointing

1498
01:46:56,109 --> 01:47:02,709
I thought the only one
who can find her is Kudo kun

1499
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:06,225
no the reason we still alive is...

1500
01:47:06,249 --> 01:47:08,049
Ran

1501
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:10,609
we fixed it for you

1502
01:47:10,979 --> 01:47:13,245
you can wear it around your neck

1503
01:47:13,269 --> 01:47:14,619
we changed it with a long thread

1504
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:16,709
let put it around your neck

1505
01:47:24,869 --> 01:47:25,934
thank you

1506
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:27,879
it suits you

1507
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:30,699
I will treasure it

1508
01:47:35,505 --> 01:47:36,525
we made it...

1509
01:47:37,912 --> 01:47:42,260
because we care for each other.
