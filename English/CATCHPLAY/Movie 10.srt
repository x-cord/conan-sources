1
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,667
Darn! Overtook again.

2
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,542
Rent a better car, man...

3
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,083
You can say that again.

4
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,750
-We should've come by train.
-Yep.

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,958
Really...

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,042
Shut up!

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,167
The client said to bring
all of you along too,

8
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,667
so I rented a car that all could ride,
didn't I?!

9
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,208
5 seconds more...

10
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,167
Huh?

11
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,667
Unless you turn the wheels right now,

12
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,833
we'll crash into the wall
in another 5 seconds.

13
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,958
What?!

14
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,875
Wow... look at that!

15
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,333
It's like a castle!

16
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,667
Then, a king used to live there?

17
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,833
No way...

18
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,375
I mean it's a hotel you know.

19
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,458
Well, it's right in front of Miracle Land...

20
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,750
so there may be a filthy rich person

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,917
that's staying here
for quite some time playing his time away

22
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,250
as if he were a king, though...

23
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,500
Come to think of it, they were saying that

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,958
the number of guests staying here
will be over 100,000 people.

25
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:54,958
Oh...

26
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,875
They're doing pretty good business

27
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,083
I guess so..

28
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,167
Oh, excuse me...

29
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,292
Are you Detective Mouri?

30
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,542
Oh, yes...

31
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,375
We've been waiting for you.

32
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:14,333
My name is Takada and
I'm working as secretary for your client.

33
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,667
Well, please come this way.

34
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,667
You, go and park their car...

35
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,583
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
(Hotel Red Castle)

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,750
Please follow me...

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,583
Wow...

39
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,083
Wow...!

40
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,375
I think we can see
the entire view of Miracle Land!

41
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,083
Please have a seat and wait.

43
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,958
Hey, just be quiet and sit down!

44
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,375
Okay...

45
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,375
Please wait a moment then.

46
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,833
This is so awesome!

47
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,875
What's the matter, Conan?

48
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:21,083
This chair doesn't seem
to match this room somehow.

49
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,375
Now that you mentioned it, I guess not...

50
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,042
Maybe they got tight on the budget?

51
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,250
No way,

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,667
after all it's such a gorgeous hotel!

53
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,750
Thank you for waiting.

54
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,458
I had you bring the children along with you

55
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,583
to give you this.

56
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,958
What on earth is this?

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,750
This is the free pass I.D of Miracle Land.

58
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,042
While you're working, Mr. Mouri,

59
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,208
we wanted to have
the children enjoy themselves

60
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,333
to their heart's content at Miracle Land...

61
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,250
Is the client the owner of this place
by any chance...?

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,375
No, he's not.

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,042
He rents this suite on an annual basis,
though...

64
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,167
Oh... what a character.

65
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,667
Okay, everyone,
please stick it onto your arms,

66
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,750
securely, so you don't drop it.

67
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,167
If you lose it, we can't re-issue it.

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,875
Here this is for you, Mr. Mouri.

69
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,042
No thank you,
because I'm not going to the amusement park.

70
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,250
Don't say that...

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,958
If you finish work early,

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,583
you can enjoy yourself with everyone else...

73
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,583
Oh...

74
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,208
This I.D is valid for a whole day

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:07,250
until 10:00 tonight,
the closing time for miracle land.

76
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,333
Meals and drinks are all free,

77
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,458
so please enjoy yourself
to your heart's content.

78
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,333
All right!

79
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
Thank you,

80
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,500
let's go, Conan.

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,417
Okay.

82
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,958
I'd like you to remain here.

83
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,875
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,458
Why?

85
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,333
Maybe you won the prize
for being the 100,000th person

86
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,583
to enter this hotel?!

87
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,667
Well, sort of...

88
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,667
No joke...

89
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,833
How lucky...

90
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,958
Let's go on ahead and stand in line then.

91
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,208
It seems that waiting you

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,417
normally have to
wait 2 hours to ride the Super Snake.

93
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,042
Okay...I guess so.

94
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,250
See you later then, Conan.

95
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,958
Uh, I wonder what the 100,000th person's
going to get?

96
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,583
All I know is that it's not
an eel lunchbox.

97
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,667
Well, well, how lucky of you!

98
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,667
Being the 100,000th person,

99
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,958
I'll bet you'll get super service.

100
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,833
I don't want anyone to get in our way so...

101
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,167
What do you mean, get in your way...?

102
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm not the 100,000th person, am I?

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,000
The confetti from the decorative paper ball

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,792
was scattered in front of the hotel already.

105
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,875
Oh? Is he right?

106
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,833
Yes, the 100,000th person
already came about an hour ago...

107
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,458
Then, why did you make him stay back?

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,875
Your client asked me to...

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,333
Hey, what's this?

110
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,083
What's going on?!

111
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,750
Thank you for coming.

112
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,458
I'm the one who called you.

113
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,208
Please forgive me for not being able
to show my face

114
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,167
because of circumstances...

115
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,542
I asked you to come here today

116
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,333
because I want you
to solve a certain incident.

117
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,000
What incident is it?

118
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,792
That's your job to figure out.

119
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,167
Huh?

120
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,667
I will give you several hints from now

121
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:12,250
I want you to use those hints
to solve the case.

122
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,875
But why do you want me to do that...?

123
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,667
You're the 5th detective
I've asked to solve the incident...

124
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,083
And, how did the previous 4 do?

125
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,250
One of them is still investigating...

126
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,833
I had two quit,

127
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:30,083
and the one other detective is here
not being able to solve the case.

128
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,333
Ryu!

129
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,750
Do you know him?

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,083
He's a detective that I worked with before.

131
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,750
I gave you the investigation report,
didn't I?!

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,458
Just how long to you intend
to keep me confined in a place like this!

133
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,833
Hurry and let me out of here!

134
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,458
Detective Ryu...

135
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,833
you were unable to solve the case...

136
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,167
What?

137
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,917
Incapable detectives have no right to live.

138
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,458
What's this?!

139
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
It's the same I.D as the one we have...

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,792
Yeah...

141
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,750
Darn! What the hell is this?!

142
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,833
Don't worry, it won't hurt...

143
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,333
You'll be at ease in an instant...

144
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,042
Don't tell me that this is why...

145
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,083
Shigeki and Yarita disappeared.

146
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,958
Goodbye... Detective Ryu...

147
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,250
Hey, wait...

148
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
Please wait... Darn!

149
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,333
Composition 4...

150
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,333
In other words,
a plastic bomb was built in to it.

151
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,875
A bomb was built in to the I.D

152
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,958
that Detective Ryu
was wearing on his chest...

153
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,667
Hey, what about Shigeki and Yarita,
that Ryu mentioned?

154
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,833
Yes... They were two detectives
who were acclaimed by the public.

155
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:04,250
However, they were just dull-witted people
who wasted my precious time.

156
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,542
You are given till 10:00 tonight...

157
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:12,750
Please figure out the truth
of a certain case till then...

158
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,083
If you fail to solve the case in time...

159
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,167
Your I.Ds will also explode

160
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,667
and you will follow Detective Ryu's path...

161
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,667
What?!

162
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,958
No use trying...

163
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,958
That I.D won't come off that easily.

164
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,750
And, if it were to come off
before I undo it,

165
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,333
it will explode immediately.

166
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,875
Why darn you.....

167
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,542
Ran...

168
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,833
Right! Ran and the others...

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,750
What about their I.Ds...?

170
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,667
The I.Ds that the children
have on are almost the same.

171
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,167
What?!

172
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,167
Almost?...

173
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,458
Their I.Ds have one extra function
added on...

174
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,667
This is the blueprint of Miracle Land.

175
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,375
Several sensors are set up

176
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,167
as if to outline Miracle Land.

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,042
When their I.Ds enter Miracle Land,

178
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,042
the sensor detects it,
and the time bomb switches on.

179
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:18,042
Then, when they pass through the sensor again
in order to leave Miracle Land,

180
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,750
at that time the I.D explodes

181
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:26,042
It was too much trouble trying
to keep track of all of them...

182
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,167
so I set it up this way.

183
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:39,958
Ran...

184
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,167
Ai!

185
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,750
Can you hear me, Ai!

186
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,250
Darn!

187
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,167
Ai!...

188
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,833
Ai!

189
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,750
What?

190
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,167
Ai, don't go inside!

191
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,167
What's the matter?

192
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,750
Never mind, just stop everybody!

193
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,167
Don't go inside!

194
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,667
But how...

195
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,750
We're already inside...

196
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,375
You're V.I.Ps...

197
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,833
That I.D is only given to special people...

198
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,583
Oh, is that so...

199
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,958
Please enjoy yourselves
to your heart's content.

200
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,583
Thank you very much.

201
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,375
What's up?

202
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,250
I'll contact you again.

203
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,167
How's Ran?

204
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,583
Darn!

205
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,958
If you solve the case by 10:00 tonight

206
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,333
and find the real culprit,

207
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,167
I will pay you as much detective fee
as you want...

208
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,000
However, if you cannot solve
the case within that time,

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,250
I will explode that I.D!

210
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,458
Take me to where that man is!
Right this minute!

211
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,667
That's impossible...

212
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,167
because I don't know where he is either.

213
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,542
What?!

214
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:55,750
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,333
Your every move is monitored.

216
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,333
There is a built-in GPS in the I.D...

217
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,958
It won't do you much good to run
to the police for help.

218
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,750
You mean,
you're going to push the explode button!

219
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:13,167
Talking for a long time is
just going reduce the time you have left...

220
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,667
The first hint is...

221
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,958
I will say it only once,
so please listen well.

222
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,875
T, A, K, A, 3 minus 8.

223
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,250
What's it about?!

224
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,750
Please say it one more time.

225
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,958
I already told you,
I'm saying it just once...

226
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,875
You have 12 hours to go
before the time limit...

227
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,667
Go and solve the case

228
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:39,583
for me... as well as for the children...

229
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
Darn!

230
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,833
Mr. Mouri,

231
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,083
please use this...

232
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,667
It's a hotline connected to the client.

233
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,250
However, you are not able to
contact the client from your side.

234
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,958
You will be getting orders
from you client through it.

235
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,750
After you solve the case,

236
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,958
please call my number
that is in this cell phone,

237
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,750
and come back here...

238
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,958
I will listen carefully
to the truth you have figured out.

239
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,625
(Detective Conan Movie 10
The Private Eyes Requiem)

240
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,958
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

241
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:42,667
I went to the amusement park
with my childhood friend Ran Mouri

242
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,875
and happened to witness the suspicious deal

243
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,458
being made by dubious
looking men dressed in black.

244
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,250
Since I was so absorbed
in watching the transaction

245
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,375
that I didn't notice
the other culprit closing in on me.

246
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,958
I was forced to drink poison by that man

247
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,708
and when I woke up

248
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,958
My body had shrunk!

249
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,958
If those guys find out
that Shinichi Kudo is alive

250
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,333
they'll come after my life again,

251
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,375
and also endanger
the lives of those around me.

252
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,750
So, taking heed of Dr. Agasa's warning,
I decided to hide my true identity.

253
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,333
Ran cornered me to tell her
what my name was,

254
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
so I told her on the spur of the moment
that I'm Conan Edogawa.

255
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,833
In order to gather information on those guys

256
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,750
I decided to free-load at Ran's house
because her father ran a detective agency...

257
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,958
The people who know of my true identity are

258
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,750
Dr. Agasa,

259
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,042
my parents,

260
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,667
high school detective of the West
Heiji Hattori

261
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,167
and my classmate Ai...

262
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,458
Dr. Agasa has invented
all kinds of devices for me

263
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,583
since I've shrunk...

264
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,542
Ai had been a member
of the Black Organization,

265
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,167
but when fleeing the organization

266
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,750
she drank the same drug
that I was forced to drink

267
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,458
and also shrunk...

268
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,875
There is one other person
that also knows about me...

269
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,583
It's the Thief Kid!

270
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,583
When he comes into the picture
things start getting complicated...

271
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,583
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

272
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,167
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan...

273
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,875
I see through the one and only truth!

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
Darn! What's with this traffic jam!

275
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,250
My daughter's life is in danger!

276
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,375
-Come on, move it! Darn!
-So,

277
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,042
no matter what,
don't let them out of Miracle Land!

278
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:50,292
If you go out of range of the area,
the I.D will explode!

279
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,458
Of course, the Super Snake's no good too!

280
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,750
Because the main feature that roller coaster

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,583
is that it goes way out
into the sea part way!

282
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
Hey, are you listening, Ai?

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,833
Yes, I got it.

284
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,667
Unless you solve the case by 10:00 tonight,

285
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,750
both you and I will turn
into particles of dust.

286
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,958
Fuh, very interesting.

287
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,958
In, Interesting,
how can you say such a thing.

288
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,458
Hey, Ai?!

289
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,833
Just what're you doing, hurry on over here!

290
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,542
Okay... our live are in your hands...

291
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,958
Mr. Detective...

292
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,333
I don't have the slightest idea...

293
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,167
What the hell is TAKA? 3 minus 8...?

294
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,083
This... can also be read 8 hyphen 3.

295
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,167
Then, T, A, K,A is the name of a town?!

296
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,042
And 3 – 8 = -5...

297
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,250
Remove the = symbol
and it can be read 3-8-5.

298
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,250
Here it is! Takashima-cho!

299
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,958
So it means, Takashima-cho 3-chome!

300
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,333
Hey... which way is 3-chome?...

301
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,375
There's no such place...

302
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,333
What?

303
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,167
There's no Takashima-cho 3-chome.

304
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,542
What?!

305
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:18,583
Give me that!

306
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,958
Darn...

307
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,958
We've got to think it over
from the start again...

308
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,375
No really.

309
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,125
Haven't the names of the towns in this area
been changed recently

310
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,375
because of redevelopment...?

311
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,667
Takashima-cho 3-8-5...

312
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,542
Yep.

313
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:44,542
Maybe the name changed
after development in this area...?

314
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,250
This area changed to Minato-Mirai.

315
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,333
There used to be a 3 chome...

316
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
Do you have a map?

317
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,167
Yes...

318
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,042
But...

319
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:15,375
does this place really
have to do with some incident?...

320
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,250
We have no choice
but to think that it does, don't we?

321
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,333
I can't figure out
why he would want me to do this

322
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,542
along with an elementary school kid
like you...

323
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,583
I think the client figured that
you wouldn't be reliable enough, Pops.

324
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,750
He's right...

325
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,083
Why would the client want me
alone to act along with Pops...?

326
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,958
Why on earth...?

327
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,167
What?

328
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,167
Who?! Who are you?!

329
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,083
You can't live here

330
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,875
because it's going to be demolished
next week...

331
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,167
You're look to be having it tough too,
with a kid and all...

332
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,667
No, no, that's not it...

333
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,250
Give me a break...

334
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,958
Have you been living here for long, sir?

335
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,042
Yeah... since two years
before the hotel went bankrupt.

336
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,333
Did anything out of
the ordinary happen lately?

337
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,833
Anything you can recall is fine.

338
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,167
Hmm... let me see...

339
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:17,250
Oh... a big white bird came flying here once.

340
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,875
Big bird?

341
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,458
It flew by right in front of the sun...

342
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,042
When was that?

343
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,833
On my birthday, April 4th.

344
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,083
That day from morning,
there was a strange car parked in front...

345
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,750
and the real estate agent
came to close off the basement.

346
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,542
A strange car?

347
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,667
Cars don't usually come in here...

348
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,292
When I went out in the morning,

349
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:45,167
a brand new car was parked in the yard
over there, but...

350
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,917
when I came back at sundown,

351
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:51,250
it had changed into an old beat up car...

352
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375
By night time,

353
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,958
only the frame work of the car was left
after all the parts were stolen, though.

354
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,167
What do you mean
by they closed down the basement?

355
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,333
The basement is the place
where they keep devices...

356
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,167
I guess they wanted to sell
the devices and make money...

357
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,750
About what time was it?!

358
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,083
Sundown...

359
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,750
What is it?!

360
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,583
Hey, kid! What's up?!

361
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,375
Oh, there you are...

362
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,667
I tell you, don't scare me...

363
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,583
Yikes!

364
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,042
What's this?!

365
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,958
Huh? What...?

366
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,458
This was inside...

367
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,958
What's that...?

368
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:31,750
This is...?!

369
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,875
A cap and gloves...

370
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,958
Even a Colt Government...

371
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,542
A receipt...

372
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,375
April 4th... Yokohama Shindo...

373
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:48,458
Pops! Isn't April 4th the day that the man
said a strange car was parked?

374
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,333
Oh... the day the car was switched...?!

375
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,958
Switched...

376
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,750
I got it! This where the getaway car
was switched to another one!

377
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,958
After the culprit used
this cap and government

378
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,458
to carry out a crime!

379
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,250
The thing is to figure out
what cases there were on April the 4th...

380
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,250
As long as we figure this out
the rest is duck soup...

381
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,375
Who are they...?

382
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,458
A gun!

383
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,958
What we know for sure is that
they're not ordinary citizens...

384
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,958
Maybe they came to get this bag?!

385
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,167
Could be...

386
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,667
Okay, I got it!

387
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,042
You go out there and distract those guys.

388
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:38,375
In the meantime I'll get the car,

389
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,083
pick you up, and let's get out of here.

390
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,667
Don't worry!

391
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,167
They won't shoot right off the bat at a kid!

392
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,250
What's with you! Can't you trust me?!

393
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,542
I can't.

394
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,583
Never mind, just go!

395
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,667
Wait.

396
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,083
Freeze,

397
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,250
Get in...

398
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,375
Oh, brother.

399
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,167
Darn...why at a crucial time like this

400
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,667
This beat up lemon.

401
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,958
You're under arrest!

402
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,250
Arrest, you guys are...

403
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,375
Police detectives?

404
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,167
It's the big bird,
the same as the one I saw back then...

405
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,167
What?!

406
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,958
It's him...

407
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,750
He flies through the world of darkness
on white wings...

408
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,750
Thief Kid!

409
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,958
Thief Kid?!

410
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,042
Inspector!
We've visually confirmed Thief Kid!

411
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,750
He is currently
on the roof of Fukayama Building!

412
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,167
On top the statue of the devil.

413
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,583
Okay, I got you!

414
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,167
President Fukayama, Thief Kid has appeared.

415
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,958
All right, let's go.

416
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, I don't think
that Thief Kid will be able to get

417
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,750
through the security system this time,
though.

418
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,250
Thief Kid!

419
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,542
Darn!

420
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,833
This is Yokomizo!

421
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,000
Thief Kid is fleeing
from the Fukayama Building,

422
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,042
heading towards
the direction of Landmark Tower!

423
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:50,458
I repeat!
Thief Kid is fleeing towards Landmark Tower!

424
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,958
Get going on the double!

425
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,458
It seems that the police on guard
was of no help.

426
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,750
Thank goodness for the security system...

427
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,958
Inspector Yokomizo!...

428
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,250
We've arrested a man who looks to be
in together with Thief Kid!

429
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,750
We'll take him to the station!

430
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,042
Okay! I'll return right away too.

431
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:12,083
Like I've been telling you,
I have nothing to do with Thief Kid!

432
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,750
I'm Kogoro Mouri!

433
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,958
Bummers... If things are left as is...

434
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,167
Your every move is being monitored.

435
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,917
The I.Ds have built-in GPS...

436
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,458
So, no use running to the police for help.

437
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,542
I.D number 1 and I.D number 2

438
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,458
are approaching
the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department.

439
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,833
Hearing that voice somehow
makes me feel excited.

440
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,042
But... I'm tired of standing
in line already...

441
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,167
I wonder how much longer
it's going to take?

442
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,875
Hmm... let's see...

443
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's say three people standing
makes a meter...

444
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,167
and this looks to be about 150 meters,

445
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,750
which comes up to 450 people...

446
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,333
22 people get to
ride the Super Snake at a time...

447
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,667
450 people make it approximately 20 times...

448
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,167
Since the time required for one round

449
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,958
including the time to get on
and get off is about 10 minutes,

450
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,750
which makes 200 minutes...

451
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,542
In other words we'd have to wait about
3 and a half hours.

452
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,333
Wow, fantastic, Mitsuhiko!

453
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,583
You mean we still have to wait that long...

454
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,292
I'm hungry...

455
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:41,292
If Dr. Agasa were here,

456
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,042
we could probably have killed time
with his play on words quiz!

457
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,333
True...

458
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,250
Okay, then would you like me
to give you quizzes today?

459
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,167
You, Ran?

460
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,167
I won't do?

461
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,042
Give the quiz, come on!

462
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,167
Okay, we'll answer your quizzes.

463
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,583
Okay, here goes, then...

464
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,958
Miracle Land Quiz!

465
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,458
The Super Snake that
you all want to ride at least once...

466
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,125
Well, out of all you little detectives,

467
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,750
who is the best suited to ride this?

468
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,958
I got it! It's Ai, isn't it?

469
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,750
Huh... why?

470
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,167
Because Ai looks like she likes snakes.

471
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,458
I don't like snakes.

472
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,333
Wrong...

473
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,042
Then, maybe it's me,

474
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,417
because just like the people standing
in line to ride Super Snake,

475
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,333
I'm always waiting for everybody.

476
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,750
What kind of a answer is that...?

477
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,250
When we go to school in the morning,

478
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,917
even if we go to pick you up,

479
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,167
we always end up waiting for you...

480
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,667
That's not right either...

481
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:39,958
What about you, Genta?

482
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,833
Hmm... me...

483
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,833
well, snake resembles eels...

484
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,833
and I love eels.

485
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,542
Really close!

486
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,458
How is Genta who likes
who loves eels over rice?

487
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,542
How is Genta...?

488
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,750
It seems he's hungry...

489
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,042
I see.

490
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,125
Super=cho(超)which means "very"

491
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,583
and Snake is pronounced hebi(ヘビ)
which resembles "heavy".

492
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,542
So, put together Super Snake
means "very heavy"

493
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,833
Therefore, the correct answer
is Genta who weighs the most...

494
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,167
Right.

495
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,167
I didn't think you'd give us
the same type of quiz as Dr. Agasa,

496
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,167
but... your quiz is a play on words
after all too.

497
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,958
(Kanagawa Prefectural Police Station)

498
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,458
Ooh, Conan, are you all right?

499
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,833
Inspector Megure.

500
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,167
What on earth happened... to Mr. Mouri...?

501
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,750
I heard you arrested Thief Kid's accomplice?

502
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,750
Oooh, Officer Nakamori.

503
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,750
Hey, Megure the badger,

504
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,750
what brings you here?

505
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,875
It seems that Mr. Mouri was
mistakenly arrested, that's why I'm here.

506
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,250
What... then you mean that
Thief Kid's accomplice

507
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,375
is that Sleeping Kogoro...?

508
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:52,042
Detectives must protect
the secret of their clients!

509
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:55,750
And I'm saying that if that client
is the Thief Kid then you're an accomplice.

510
00:28:56,042 --> 00:29:00,167
Why was the Kanagawa Prefectural Police
staking out that building?

511
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,458
We got a warning note from Thief Kid.

512
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,458
That building happens to be the main office
of Fukayama Trading Company.

513
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,792
On the very top floor of that building,

514
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,125
the president Mr. Fukayama happens to have

515
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,750
an exhibition of jewelry that
he collects as a hobby.

516
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,833
However, unlike last time,

517
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,250
it seems that nothing was stolen this time.

518
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,208
You mean he was broken into before too?

519
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:23,042
Yeah, a huge diamond was stolen
on April 4th this year,

520
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:26,042
so it seems he upgraded
the security system of the building,

521
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,583
so President Fukayama must be elated
at the outcome this time.

522
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,250
April 4th.

523
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,958
Isn't Officer Yokomizo of
the 1st Division...?

524
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,750
The 2nd Division are the ones in charge
of the Thief Kid, aren't they?

525
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:40,958
There's a strange person after Thief Kid's life recently...

526
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,042
and because of that,
some people have been wounded,

527
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:45,292
that's why the 1st Division
is also helping out...

528
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,750
After Thief Kid's life?

529
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,750
I got a phone call.

530
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,167
Excuse me, a minute...

531
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,250
Detective Mouri...

532
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,167
Rather, Kudo?

533
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,458
So, it's you after all,

534
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,167
high school detective, Shinichi Kudo...

535
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,875
You being there
with Detective Mouri surprised me.

536
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,583
I actually wanted you
to investigate for me too, but...

537
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:23,750
but I didn't know how to contact you.

538
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,542
Phooey, so unable to solve the case you ran
to the police, eh...

539
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,958
No, we didn't come to the police.

540
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,833
Detective Mouri was mistakenly arrested
by police officers

541
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,458
who were staking out a dilapidated hotel.

542
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,083
Fuh... you're really honest, aren't you?

543
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,583
You mean this guy knew
that the officers were there...

544
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,167
Well, never mind...

545
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,583
And, what did you find at the hotel...?

546
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:50,750
We found a cap and a gun that
seems to have been used to commit a crime...

547
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,750
Good work, Kudo...

548
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,750
Then, here's the second hint...

549
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,167
Go to the Café Terrace at Night...

550
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,583
The Café Terrace at Night...

551
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:04,250
You should know where that is...

552
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,458
I'll solve the case no matter what it takes!

553
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,875
So, please remove
the I.Ds on Ran and the others!

554
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,458
Hey! Are you listening or what?!

555
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,083
Darn...

556
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,958
To lose a loved one...

557
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,375
How painful it is to lose a loved one...

558
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:24,667
Do your best so that
it doesn't turn out that way...

559
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,083
Kudo.

560
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,750
Why...

561
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,750
Why does ne know who I am...?

562
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,375
Who...

563
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,083
who on earth is he...?

564
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:54,542
The line's not moving at all and yet
I'm getting hungrier and hungrier...

565
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,667
True...

566
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,958
Come to think of it, it's already noon...

567
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,750
I'll stand in line,

568
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,167
so why don't you all go
get something to eat?

569
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,542
You mean you don't mind, Ai?!

570
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,042
But, I feel bad leaving Ai behind alone.

571
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,042
Oh...

572
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:10,750
Okay, I'll stay behind with Ai then.

573
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,083
I'll stay behind too!

574
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,833
Okay, me too, then...

575
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,375
How silly, if so, what's the point?

576
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,250
Then let's do this...

577
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,333
We'll stand in line every 30 minutes
taking turns...

578
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,333
And we'll start with Ai, how that?

579
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,958
Agreed!

580
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,667
Okay... so I'll see you all in 30 minutes...

581
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,458
-Okay...
-Here goes!

582
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,750
Okay, bye...

583
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,583
You can go first.

584
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,458
I wonder how long I can buy time here...

585
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:43,833
(Yokohama Ohashi Harbor Bridge)

586
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:47,375
I may be able to figure something out
if a take it apart but,

587
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,167
there's no guarantee that
it won't explode...

588
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,750
so, I can't do anything about it here...

589
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,875
I see...

590
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,667
Oh, that's right...

591
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,458
I powered this up.

592
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,667
Thank you!

593
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,667
Oh, right, did you figure out

594
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,583
where the "Café Terrace at Night" is?

595
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,167
Where on earth is it?

596
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,167
The Café Terrace at Night

597
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,958
is a painting drawn
by Vincent Van Gogh in 1888.

598
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:19,167
of a landscape of a café terrace lit
with the misty light of a street lamp,

599
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,750
where a carriage is coming from beyond.

600
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,083
Street lamp and a horse drawn carriage...

601
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,167
There's no other place
in Japan than the place

602
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,667
where the first street lamp was built,

603
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,375
which is Bashamichi!

604
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,375
Talk about really powering it up, Doc.

605
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,250
Ai,

606
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:54,750
here you go.

607
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,958
Thank you...

608
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,667
Thanks for waiting...

609
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,167
The line's moved only this much yet...

610
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,375
I guess my calculation wasn't correct...

611
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,833
Let me take your place.

612
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,833
Okay.

613
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,750
Oh come on, Ran.

614
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,250
You really like childish things like this,
don't you?

615
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,083
Sonoko?! What are you doing here...?

616
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,667
See, the Red Castle Hotel over there...

617
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,750
A party's going to be held there tonight,

618
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,875
celebrating the coming
or over 100,000 people today...

619
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,167
It's like dad built that hotel, you see...

620
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:29,083
That's I was killing time till then
at this amusement park.

621
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,042
Huh... Where did you pick that up

622
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,250
No!

623
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,375
Dad's client gave this to us.

624
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,667
A really VIP client,

625
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:44,458
I lost my I.D so I thought I dropped it.

626
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,750
Okay, I'll invite you
and the children to the party

627
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,250
so what do you say we go to the Red Castle,
just us girls, now?

628
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,042
Since the children also have I.Ds on them,

629
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:57,042
it'll be no problem leaving them
to themselves.

630
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:59,583
She looks especially capable too.

631
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,667
But...

632
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,250
They're having a cake buffet right now
at the restaurant of the hotel!

633
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,500
So long as you have this I.D

634
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,167
you're free
to go in and out of Miracle Land!

635
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,458
What on earth is going to happen here?...

636
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,375
Freeze!

637
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,958
Heiji...

638
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,167
Well, did I scare you?

639
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,250
Shut up!

640
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,167
What good timing.

641
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,958
I need your help, Shinichi.

642
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:06,083
What, you too, Shinichi...

643
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,875
You too, then...

644
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,083
He's taken Kazuha hostage...

645
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,750
Well, she doesn't know a thing

646
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,375
and is playing free of care
at that amusement park, though...

647
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,875
Phone voi The number you have reached

648
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,333
is not within service range
or is not switched on

649
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,042
so the line cannot be connected...

650
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,458
The number you have reached...

651
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,750
Oh come on! After telling me that

652
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,583
he'd finish right away
so to do what I want here and wait...

653
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:38,458
I really understand
how Ran feels having to wait for Shinichi...

654
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,083
Huh? Kazuha?

655
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,458
Oh, Ran...

656
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,750
Kazuha! It's been a long time
since I've seen you last!

657
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,458
I didn't know you were here...

658
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,750
Where's Heiji?

659
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,167
We're here on business, b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s...

660
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,333
I see, what a bummer...

661
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,542
Oh, Kazuha...

662
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:55,958
Sonoko!

663
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,333
We were just going to a cake buffet.

664
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,458
Would you like to come along too?

665
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,875
I love cake!

666
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,583
Okay, then let's go.

667
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,667
Come on, Ran, let's go.

668
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,750
Oh, I wait.

669
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,583
I see...

670
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,125
So, your girlfriend's being
held hostage too...

671
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,583
Yeah... not only Ran,

672
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,083
but the four children too... Besides...

673
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:28,583
the client seems to think that
I'm Shinichi Kudo.

674
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,833
You mean he knows your true identity?!

675
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,542
Well, I don't know about that, but.

676
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:40,250
Hey! I hope the secret about your body
having shrunk is not disclosed,

677
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,250
to the Black Organization, is it...?

678
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:57,958
Hey...

679
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,833
What's up?!

680
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,958
A cap, gun and getaway car...

681
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,958
I get it! A cash transporting car attack!

682
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:07,792
Yeah...

683
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,542
Is that it,
what the guy was talking about...?

684
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:21,750
Most likely...

685
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,167
Excuse me?

686
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,458
What is it, sonny?

687
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:33,833
Wasn't that cash transporting car
attacked before?

688
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,667
Yes... it was...

689
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,750
I think it was on April 4th...

690
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,833
Since you're doing business here,

691
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,375
I'm sure that the police
asked you questions, didn't they?...

692
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,083
Will you tell us
the details of what you know too?

693
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:47,792
Yes...

694
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,083
I think it was just about the same time...

695
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,583
Don't move, stay still!

696
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,167
It really seemed like just a split second...

697
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:07,042
It was hard to tell if it was happening
for real or just a dream...

698
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:09,250
You mean they worked really fast.

699
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,583
Thank you, Miss...

700
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,458
Wait!

701
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:26,833
Today is the worst day of your lives
for both you boys...

702
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,875
It's best to go home and sleep...

703
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,167
Okay, will do...

704
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,958
after we change it
into the best day of our lives.

705
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,417
Bye...

706
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,708
Stop roaming around on your own!

707
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,667
I looked for you, you know.

708
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,833
Ugh, stop...

709
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,750
Come, come, this is no time to be fighting.

710
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:54,750
How come the black boy from Osaka is here?

711
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,958
The reason you're here...

712
00:39:58,167 --> 00:39:59,250
Mr. Mouri.

713
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,583
Give me the cell phone given to you
by your client.

714
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,667
Isn't it about time you tell us the truth.

715
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,250
The truth well...

716
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,875
There's only so much a detective can do...

717
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,250
I think it's best that you let us handle
this case as soon as possible.

718
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,042
This is Mouri.

719
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,375
So, this time it's you, Detective Mouri.

720
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,750
Oh well... You're on Bashamichi right now,
aren't you.

721
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,750
Yes.

722
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,333
You shouldn't be making friends
with the police.

723
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,875
Why you, are you watching me?!

724
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,583
Is that it?!

725
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,542
Are you going to break your promise,
Mr. Mouri?

726
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,542
No, I'm not.

727
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,458
What happened is beyond my control.

728
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:46,167
Mr. Mouri, who on earth are you talking to?!

729
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:50,958
Stupid... stupid...
Disappear incapable police!

730
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,333
What?!

731
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,250
Stupid... stupid...
Disappear incapable police!

732
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,250
Darn! What's with that doll!

733
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,667
Stupid... stupid...
Disappear incapable police!

734
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,958
Hey... This looks bad.

735
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,667
Look out! Get away from that doll!

736
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,542
It'll explode!

737
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:05,333
What?!

738
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,833
10 seconds before explosion!

739
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,833
9

740
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,833
8

741
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,833
7

742
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:10,833
6

743
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,833
5

744
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,833
4

745
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,833
-3
-Darn!

746
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:14,833
2

747
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:15,750
1...

748
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,250
Mama!

749
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,250
Officer Yokomizo.

750
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,250
We need an ambulance right away!

751
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,667
Why you!

752
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,458
Next the children that you brought with you
will turn out this way

753
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:38,958
Mr. Mouri.

754
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,958
What's the matter?

755
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,958
This I.D has begun flashing from
a while ago...

756
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,250
Mine too...

757
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,750
Sonoko, do you know anything?

758
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,750
Nope...this is the first time
I've seen anything like this before too...

759
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,750
Maybe the employee
at the exit would know something?

760
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,333
Ghads,

761
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,958
not being able to dodge
that scale of explosion,

762
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,542
I don't know about the police nowadays!

763
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,750
What?!

764
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,667
Isn't this all happening because of you?!

765
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:14,250
Come off it.
You have no such proof anywhere...

766
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,333
To be honest with you,
you're causing me a great inconvenience.

767
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,833
Stop hanging around me!

768
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,375
What...

769
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,167
I was right to have quit being
a police detective...

770
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,458
I want to live a long life after all...

771
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,125
Let's go, you guys.

772
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,333
Yeah...

773
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,833
Inspector...Is it okay?

774
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:33,958
It's okay.

775
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,750
Ran and the children are being held hostage
at Miracle Land.

776
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,042
They have an I.D on their wrists
that will explode if they leave the grounds.

777
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:45,250
Please save them under extreme secrecy.
Thank you, Mouri.

778
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,750
I asked the police
to take care of Ran and the others.

779
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,875
Well, whether it turns out to be good luck

780
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,125
for us or not is all up to our brains.

781
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,958
And? Did you get anything yet?

782
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:04,333
Yeah, it seems that a cash transporting car
was attacked on Bashamichi on April 4th.

783
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,292
The police officer was also saying
that it was the same day

784
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:10,833
that the Thief Kid stole the diamond
from Fukayama Museum.

785
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:11,958
I see...

786
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,875
Okay, I'll check things on my side too...

787
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,083
Don't you kids get too reckless now.

788
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,458
What the hell is he talking about.

789
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,667
This is probably the last hint
we'll bet at Bashamichi.

790
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,875
What the hell does he want us to solve
with just this much information!

791
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:34,542
But, there's still another hint
that hasn't been solved.

792
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,375
What?!

793
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,958
This is the hint he gave me!

794
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:42,750
Café Terrace at Night, and You cry...

795
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,750
You got a hint different from ours...

796
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,458
Right...

797
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,958
YOU CRY...

798
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:53,167
if written in capital letters...

799
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,042
YOU stands for,

800
00:43:55,042 --> 00:44:02,875
Yeah..."Yokohama Oceanic University"
located in the suburbs of Yokohama...

801
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:05,333
So the only thing left is CRY...

802
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,583
That's what I can't figure out...

803
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:12,167
I guess we've got no choice
but to go to "YOU"...

804
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,583
Yeah...

805
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:22,958
Ran, quick!

806
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,333
Excuse me.

807
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,958
Yes? What can I do for you?

808
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,750
Why is this I.D flashing red?

809
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,333
I wonder...

810
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,167
this is the first time I saw anything like that...
-Ms. Ran Mouri, of Beika Town,

811
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,250
I see.

812
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,958
and Ms. Kazuha Toyama who is with her,

813
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,250
please come immediately to the medical room.

814
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,750
I wonder what it is...

815
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,958
Maybe something happened to the children.

816
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,250
Let's go right away...

817
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,833
I'm sorry, Sonoko... Will you go alone?

818
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:51,333
No problem, something may have happened
to the kids so hurry on over to them...

819
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,583
I'm sorry...

820
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,583
I guess I'll go eat my heart out...

821
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:00,875
What's the matter?

822
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,750
She passed out on the grounds of the park...

823
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,458
I think it's a light case of heat stroke.

824
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,750
I see...

825
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,333
I'm sorry...

826
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,667
It's okay, don't worry.

827
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,250
But, why did you also call Kazuha?

828
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,083
This is the first time
I ever talked to her...

829
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:21,583
That's... That's because...

830
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,542
That's easy.

831
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:26,458
She feels more secure
with two people than one.

832
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:27,667
Right.

833
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,042
Let's let her rest for a while...

834
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:31,750
Will you stay and watch her...?

835
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,083
Of course.

836
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,750
Please stay with me al the way...

837
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,542
I thought she was a sassy kid,

838
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,667
but she can be pretty cute...

839
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,667
All this acting...is tiring me out...

840
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,083
CRY, CRY, CRY...

841
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,083
Is it a name of a class,
an abbreviated name...

842
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:58,333
What about the name of a club
at the university

843
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,375
Could be...

844
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,667
Some other things it may stand
for would be...

845
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,167
Crime Research Yokohama...

846
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,250
Crime Research Yokohama...

847
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,583
I think that this club is more than close
to what it stands for...

848
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,083
Who are you?

849
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,333
I'm Saguru Shirauma.

850
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:21,833
I'm in the same shoes you are in many ways.

851
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,542
In our shoes?

852
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:27,542
You're the son of the Police Commissioner
and a high school detective, right?

853
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:31,375
Yeah. I could never beat you,
an elementary school detective, though.

854
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:32,875
I see...

855
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,042
so you're in the same boat as me

856
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,333
in that my dad's the head of
the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters...

857
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,958
That's not all...

858
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,167
Don't tell me that...

859
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:46,750
The one who is precious to me
is also in Miracle Land...

860
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,167
Well, let's talk about trivial things
while walking,

861
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:53,167
the more time we lose,
the more will end up CRYing.

862
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,375
True...

863
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,375
Hey, is anybody home?

864
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,125
Hey...!

865
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,250
We're coming in.

866
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,583
Get a load of the information
that got here...

867
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,583
Hey...take a look at this picture...

868
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,083
It seems to be snapshots of
the members of the club...

869
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,667
We better take pictures of this picture.

870
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:29,583
I guess so.

871
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,958
The client?

872
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,125
Yeah...

873
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:35,583
What is it?...

874
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:38,583
You've figure it out

875
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,750
as much as you did with the hint YOU CRY...

876
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,458
All of you have never stopped amazing me...

877
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,833
I don't know about you,

878
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,750
but you want us to solve the case,
don't you?

879
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,750
Why don't you give us simpler hints?

880
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,458
If you solve it too easily,
it's not interesting for me at all...

881
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:56,458
Besides...

882
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,333
I'm testing you all...

883
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,750
for your capabilities as a detective...

884
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,833
Whether you are qualified
to solve my case or not.

885
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,250
What?!

886
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,250
From here on now, there are no hints...

887
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:10,750
I'll be counting on you, young detective.

888
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,167
Hey, you! Wait up!

889
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,750
Darn... He hung up...

890
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,083
No hint...

891
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,667
Just what does he
expect us to do...?

892
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:32,958
(Mission completed at Yokohama Ocean University)

893
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,583
Huh? You guys are...

894
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,875
What do you want?

895
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,542
Oh, well, we're, you see...

896
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:45,542
We're planning to enter this university
next year,

897
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,083
so we came to check it out...

898
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:51,333
Okay, if you enroll,
make sure you join our club.

899
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,750
Yes, of course.

900
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,167
Uh, excuse me, miss!

901
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,583
What are those pictures lined up over there?

902
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:02,167
The pictures from the left are those of
the department heads of the past.

903
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:07,083
Then why is the picture of
the 3rd department head removed?

904
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,375
Look, next to the picture
beside the last picture

905
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,167
there is a hanger attachment on the wall,

906
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:17,042
and after the 3rd picture,

907
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:20,083
a small area of untarnished wall
can be seen next to each picture.

908
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,000
This means that for some reason the picture
of the 3rd department head

909
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,625
was removed for some reason,

910
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,167
and the other pictures

911
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,250
were moved accordingly
and put up again, right?

912
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,375
Am I wrong?

913
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:35,958
The 3rd department head,
Mr. Ito was dismissed.

914
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:39,833
Oh, Mr. Jiro Ito, was it?

915
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,708
No, it was Mr. Suehiko Ito, do you know him?

916
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,250
Yes, well, sort of...

917
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,833
It's him... isn't it?

918
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,750
No... it's him.

919
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,667
Oh, I see...

920
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,042
What an actor...

921
00:49:56,042 --> 00:50:00,667
I'm sorry,
I guess he's not the Mr. Ito that I know...

922
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,750
(Osaka prefectural police station)
Suehiko Ito?!

923
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,542
Heiji, who's this man
you want me to look up supposed to be?

924
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:13,375
I don't know, that's why
I want you to check for me, Officer Ohtaki.

925
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,667
Does the Chief know about this...?

926
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:16,958
It's a secret.

927
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,542
A secret, Heiji...

928
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,667
I'll be waiting to hear from you, then.

929
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,167
Hey, Heiji?!

930
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,958
I guess, I'll go take a break, break time...

931
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,667
Well, shall we go eat at the cafeteria?

932
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,958
When the glucose count goes down,
my brain doesn't seem to work well...

933
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,333
Idiot, we don't have time to waste.

934
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,167
We're waiting for a call, you know.

935
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,958
Like they say, a samurai even
when starving acts as if his stomach is full.

936
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,542
But, they also say,
you can't work on an empty stomach, right?

937
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:54,375
Besides, I've already figured out the answer
for what you're about to investigate...

938
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,125
The Metropolitan Police Department
is closer to Yokohama

939
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,667
than the Osaka Prefectural Police Department

940
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,250
that's why.

941
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,875
He gets on my nerves...

942
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,667
Yes... Yeah...

943
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,750
This time for sure, when I get back there,
I promise I'll treat you... Yeah...

944
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:14,667
Okay, then thanks Ao-chan, right away, okay.

945
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:18,167
What's up, Ohtaki?

946
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,667
Boss...

947
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:24,375
Wasn't that your cousin Aoki that's at
the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department?

948
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:28,333
It's nothing.
I just kind of missed talking to him...

949
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,958
You don't need to hide anything.

950
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,458
Heizo's son asked you to search for him,
right?

951
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,583
I got a call too.

952
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,583
Oh, so you got a call too...

953
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:40,167
I got you, Ohtaki...

954
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,333
What's up with my son?

955
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,167
Chief?!

956
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:49,458
Let's go to my office
and have you tell me the details, all right?

957
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,667
Spit it out and it'll be easier for you...

958
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,958
Well, uh...

959
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,750
Staying like this is not that easy...

960
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,958
Okay, then please take care of things...

961
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,458
Inspector Megure...

962
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:19,042
I'll go say hello to him.

963
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:20,250
I'll go too,

964
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,458
since he's always been nice to Heiji.

965
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,333
I'm going to go ride Super Snake

966
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,083
So take care of things here, okay!

967
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,250
Wait!

968
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,958
You've got to stay in bed yet!

969
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,875
Please stop him! Please!

970
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,667
Okay.

971
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,167
Inspector Megure...!?

972
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,750
Oh, Ran, Kazuha too...

973
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,667
What's up today?! Why are you both here...?

974
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,458
Are you working on a case or something?

975
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,042
Oh, well...it's our day off.

976
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:55,375
What a life, having to spend my day off
with Inspector Shiratori...

977
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,542
You mean you came to Miracle Land,
just the two of you...?

978
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:01,958
My god...

979
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,875
Huh? Ran.

980
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,667
Those children...

981
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:07,750
Inspector...

982
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,042
What? ! No joke...!

983
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:19,833
(Super Snake is currently down for maintenance,
we apologize for the inconvenience)

984
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,542
God punished you
from trying to beat us all to it.

985
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,750
Come on, let's go back to the medical room!

986
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,958
We're very sorry!

987
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:30,167
We ask for your cooperation
to maintain safety!

988
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,750
We'll be passing out
numbered tickets starting now!

989
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:43,458
Thief!

990
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,333
A thief!

991
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,250
Ayumi?

992
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,375
Ran!

993
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,750
I wonder why Inspector Megure is here...?

994
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,167
Hey, Officer Takagi?!

995
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,250
What're you doing?

996
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,375
Oh, well... you see....

997
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:12,042
Agh... I'll bet you were looking at
some cute girl while dating with me?!

998
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:15,667
You know
I wouldn't never do something like that!

999
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:18,667
What? Which is it? You're incomprehensible.

1000
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:20,583
I,I guess so.

1001
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:25,458
I won't tell her that
I saw Inspector Megure...

1002
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:28,333
Wow, that curry sure looks good!

1003
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,542
Here goes!

1004
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:30,958
Go ahead and help yourself.

1005
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,458
This is so good!
What curry is this?

1006
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,958
Yuk! What's with this curry,

1007
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,833
you can taste the flour!

1008
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:46,167
And, what kind of person is Mr. Suehiko Ito?

1009
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:48,667
It seems that Ito is wanted for the robbery

1010
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:52,750
of the cash transporting vehicle
that occurred at Bashamichi

1011
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,333
on April 4th this year.

1012
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,333
I see,

1013
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,250
that's why his picture
was removed from that room...

1014
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,750
That's not the only thing that's interesting.

1015
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:06,167
After he graduated from university
he managed an investment advisory company

1016
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:10,958
but a person was also killed
at that company called Far East Office.

1017
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:11,958
What?!

1018
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,750
How about it? Interesting, isn't it?

1019
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,083
Okay!

1020
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,958
Let's head off

1021
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:22,250
for that company called
Far East Office now then!

1022
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:24,583
All that complaining
and you cleaned the entire dish...

1023
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,333
I'm back...

1024
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,083
Hi, Ms. Kisaki.

1025
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,042
I'm sorry, Ms. Kuriyama,

1026
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,458
but could you get me
something cold to drink?

1027
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:43,167
Yes, ma'am.

1028
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,083
Yes, this is Eri.

1029
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,458
Oh, hi, it's you,

1030
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,667
what's up?

1031
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:56,583
I thought you were supposed to go with Ran
and the others to Miracle Land today?

1032
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,542
Wait!

1033
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:00,167
Documents for a case,

1034
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,167
just what are you doing?

1035
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,375
Uh, well, a lot of things...

1036
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,083
and have nowhere else I can ask...

1037
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,042
Okay,

1038
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:13,667
the cash transporting car robbery
that happened on April the 4th, right...

1039
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,250
I'll check on it right away
and get back to you.

1040
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Yeah, thanks a lot...

1041
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,583
Dear?

1042
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,250
Uh, Eri...

1043
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,958
Do think I can solve... this case...

1044
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,875
Footwork is important
to investigate a case...

1045
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,042
Isn't that what you said?

1046
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,583
Ex-police detective?

1047
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,833
Right... That's right...

1048
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,250
Get the papers for me, okay...

1049
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,458
Yes, sure thing.

1050
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,208
Come here...

1051
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:56,750
Please come in.

1052
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,333
Excuse me...

1053
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,750
Huh? Didn't you just get a call?

1054
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,833
Yes, I did.

1055
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,375
From somebody that I really don't care for,

1056
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:07,667
right, Goro??

1057
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,583
It was from her husband , I see...

1058
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,458
(Non-personnel are prohibited from entering)

1059
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,250
When I'm told not to...

1060
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,750
the more you want to go in...

1061
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,583
That's the saga of a detective...

1062
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,667
The one who was murdered
is Mr. Masaharu Nishio,

1063
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:31,458
Chief Sales Manager of Far East Office...

1064
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,583
It seems he was shot with a rifle.

1065
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:37,167
He used to be a classmate of the President
in his University days.

1066
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,958
Which means...

1067
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:42,167
That maybe Nishio also belonged
to the Crime Research Yokohama Club?

1068
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:44,250
You hit the bull's eye...

1069
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,375
Come...

1070
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:50,750
Come? Hey, that's my cell phone?!
When did he take it...

1071
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,375
Look...at the front line of this picture.

1072
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,458
The one in the middle is Suehiko Ito
who was then head of the club.

1073
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,750
The one at the right beside him is Nishio,
the one who was killed...

1074
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:05,750
Uh, who's the lady that
is sitting to the left of Mr. Ito?

1075
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,083
Oh, she's Reiko Shimizu...

1076
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:12,375
She seems to have been working
for this office too,

1077
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,583
but committed suicide on May 15th.

1078
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,458
Suicide?!

1079
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:21,958
While she was being voluntarily questioned
by the police...

1080
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,750
About Nishio being shot?

1081
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,167
They seemed to have been really tough
with her...

1082
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,667
This is the site of
where the shooting occurred...

1083
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:36,375
It sure is dusty...

1084
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:39,333
It seems to be left as it was
when the shooting took place.

1085
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:44,083
Well, back then, the blinds and windows
seem to have been open, though.

1086
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:55,583
The sniper shot Nishio
from the toilet of that building...

1087
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:05,083
The rifle that was used was a
Charter Arms AR-7 with a scope and silencer.

1088
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,583
They seem to have found 8 shell cases
on the floor of the toilet...

1089
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,583
The sniper shot all 8 bullets
that were in the rifle.

1090
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:18,542
One of the bullets that was fired seemed to
have struck Nishio in the back of his head,

1091
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,167
and killed him instantly...

1092
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,042
After that the plan for the attacking
and robbing the cash transporting vehicle

1093
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:29,250
that Ito wrote out was found
in Nishio's desk,

1094
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,667
so, Ito was listed as wanted by the police...

1095
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:36,167
And, why was Reiko Shimizu called in
for questioning?

1096
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,083
Beats me...

1097
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,458
Take a look, Heiji.

1098
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,125
If he was shot in the back of the head,

1099
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,958
isn't the amount of blood a bit too small?

1100
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,250
True...

1101
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,750
But, on the other hand,

1102
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,167
there's a large smear of blood
on this side...

1103
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:52,667
What is the meaning of this...

1104
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,500
The blood that smeared the chair

1105
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,583
is dripped straight towards
the seat part of the chair...

1106
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,958
Moreover, look.

1107
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,167
One of the casters have been hit
and came off...

1108
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:07,833
I get it, so that's the story...

1109
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,583
Right...

1110
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,333
This is Hattori.

1111
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,458
It seems you've made it to the next step...

1112
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:18,750
Heiji Hattori...

1113
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:20,583
Yeah, somehow.

1114
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,958
Did you figure out
which case I want you to solve?

1115
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:27,083
The case of Masaharu Nisho's shooting,
isn't it?

1116
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,583
Hey... Don't tell me that you're...

1117
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:32,958
Darn!

1118
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,458
What is it?!

1119
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,667
Motorbikes?!

1120
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,958
All I know is this doesn't look good.

1121
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,750
Who're are they?!

1122
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,042
Just some things to make
the game more interesting,

1123
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:52,333
that the client mentioned.

1124
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,083
This is just too interesting...

1125
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,625
No good!

1126
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:57,792
Let's split up!

1127
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,750
-Right!
-Okay!

1128
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,083
Okay! It's a one-to-one match...

1129
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,458
I'm ready when you are!

1130
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,583
What an ugly face...

1131
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,458
Oh... did I offend you?

1132
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,542
Darn...

1133
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:43,750
You coward!

1134
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,583
Fight bare-handed you! Bare-handed!

1135
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:06,958
I wonder if Shinichi made it to safety...

1136
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,917
Bummers...

1137
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,375
Paint splattered on my shirt
and spoiled it...

1138
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,667
Stop!

1139
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:14,083
He was a man wearing a baseball cap
and a jacket, right...

1140
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,333
Yes... but maybe he already took the off...

1141
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,875
I guess so...

1142
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,667
What's wrong?

1143
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:22,667
Doesn't he look suspicious?

1144
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,333
Oh.. the one with the ○○colored shirt...

1145
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:29,333
See... the one with his hair flipped up
in two layers...

1146
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,583
It goes to show that he was wearing a cap...

1147
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:35,750
He probably got rid of it along
with his jacket and the bag he took...

1148
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:38,250
Just as would be expected of the girlfriend

1149
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,333
of the Shinichi Kudo,
high school detective of the East!

1150
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,667
I'm not exactly his girlfriend!

1151
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,250
Coke was spilled on the culprits shoe,
right?

1152
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:57,083
Yeah, I did it deliberately
to leave evidence behind.

1153
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:03,167
My bag!

1154
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,750
Wow, Genta!

1155
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,083
Wrong, Ayumi.

1156
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:20,250
You shouldn't lie, Genta...

1157
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:24,750
Thief!

1158
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,042
I saw what happened!

1159
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:29,375
Oh? You were...

1160
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:33,583
There he is!

1161
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,667
A middle-aged lady...

1162
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:48,583
There he is!

1163
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,167
Hey, Ayumi?!

1164
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,583
Is he the one, Ayumi?

1165
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:58,958
Yep. He's got coke on his left sneaker.

1166
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:02,667
He's looking around
and really looks suspicious...

1167
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,167
No doubt about it!

1168
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,167
Yeah.

1169
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:09,375
Let's tail him!

1170
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,958
No good...

1171
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,958
I wonder where the children are going...?

1172
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:22,750
Thief!

1173
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,167
Hold it!

1174
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,750
We won't let you get away!

1175
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,958
Move! Get out of my way!

1176
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,375
Move! Move!

1177
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,958
Out of my way, move!

1178
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:49,083
Please lend this to me for a while!

1179
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,375
Hold it!

1180
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,458
Darn...

1181
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,750
Turn yourself in.

1182
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,833
The police will be here soon...

1183
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,875
Keep your nose out of
other people's business!

1184
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,625
Oh no!

1185
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,250
Oh, Ayumi!

1186
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,000
Ayumi...

1187
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:28,750
Don't move!

1188
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:32,375
If you move there's no guarantee
what'll happen to this brat!

1189
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,958
Number 5 is approaching the main gate.

1190
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,083
Who is it?

1191
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:54,458
Number 5... Ayumi Yoshida...

1192
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:55,958
I see...

1193
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,958
Stay away from me...

1194
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:04,667
If you come close, this brat's going to die!

1195
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,750
You! Let that girl go.

1196
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,042
I'll be your hostage in her place!

1197
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,042
You gotta be joking, old fart!

1198
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:16,458
Then, I'll be your hostage...

1199
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:20,333
Let me, because it's my fault
that she got caught...

1200
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:21,958
Not you girls!

1201
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,750
Oh, no, well...
We can't have lay people acting as hostage...

1202
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,250
Quit babbling!

1203
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,458
I'm not changing the hostage,
no matter what!

1204
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:34,250
You guys stay put
until I go through the gate.

1205
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,958
Don't forget the brat's life is at stake!

1206
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:43,958
No! If she's carried outside...

1207
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:54,042
Hey, this is the entrance, isn't it?!

1208
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:55,458
The exit's beside it!

1209
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:57,250
Never mind, and move out of the way!

1210
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,167
No use shouting at me!

1211
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:01,583
Follow the rules!

1212
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,958
I tell you, adults nowadays

1213
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,833
aren't able to even follow rules like this.

1214
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,250
Get him!

1215
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:14,083
Move!

1216
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,250
Ha, ha, there are loads of hostages here!

1217
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,750
Stay away...

1218
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,750
If you don't I'm going to...

1219
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,750
What're you going to do...?

1220
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:30,250
What do you mean?

1221
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,667
I wish you'd tell me...

1222
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,750
What you plan to do?

1223
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:49,583
Excuse me...
please let me through. Excuse me...

1224
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,542
Excuse me...

1225
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:53,333
I got you a soft cream cone.

1226
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,167
Officer... Sato?...

1227
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,583
Inspector Megure...

1228
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,750
Uh... what're you doing here...

1229
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:06,750
I'd like to ask you the same question...

1230
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,167
Oh, well... Uh...you see...

1231
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,375
Shinichi...

1232
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,750
Shinichi... Shinichi...

1233
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:22,375
Hey, Shinichi! Shinichi!...

1234
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,167
You've finally come out of it!

1235
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,333
Where am I?

1236
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,667
Inside gramps Agasa's car

1237
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,583
Doc...

1238
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,667
Don't push yourself!

1239
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:37,042
I put splint on your leg
as a temporary measure,

1240
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:40,250
but your bone may be broken

1241
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,667
Heiji, you saved me?

1242
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,375
No Shirauma did,

1243
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:47,667
He called gramps asking him to come here,
and when he arrived,

1244
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:50,333
he found Shirauma carrying you,
who with wounds all over...

1245
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:54,458
After that,
gramps called me so I joined all of you.

1246
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,958
Shirauma saved me...

1247
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,958
Yeah, he left before I got here saying

1248
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:02,083
that he had something he had to check on,
though...

1249
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,333
What time is it now?

1250
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,167
How much time went by since then?

1251
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:09,958
It's been 2 hours and it's 8:30 right now...

1252
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,333
An hour and a half to go...

1253
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,542
We're headed for Red Castle...

1254
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:18,750
Did you figure out who killed Mr. Nishio...?

1255
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,875
No, we're just headed there, that's it.

1256
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,250
I mean
it's no use staying in one place so...

1257
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:28,750
While you were sleeping
we got a call from Mr. Ohtaki...

1258
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,875
and found out many things...

1259
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:35,167
We found out that
there was more to Nishio's murder case.

1260
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,667
On the night that Nishio was murdered

1261
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:44,167
a car turned over at a container yard
of a pier and was completely scrapped

1262
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:53,292
The one driving was... Suehiko Ito...

1263
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:55,167
He was wounded to the point
where many considered it a miracle

1264
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:56,167
that he was still alive,

1265
01:11:56,167 --> 01:12:00,083
and it seems he had to stay in the I.C.U.
for a month...

1266
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,042
When the police checked the car
that was involved in the accident,

1267
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,333
they found that the oil pressure pipe
had been tampered with. Moreover,

1268
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:12,375
they found a silencer equipped rifle
inside the trunk of the car...

1269
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,292
The fingerprints were wiped off but,

1270
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:21,958
the rifle was found
to be the one who killed Nishio...

1271
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,833
And, was Ito arrested?

1272
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,458
Several months after the accident,

1273
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,542
the police were finally allowed
to see him at the hospital,

1274
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:31,542
so they went...

1275
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:32,667
We're coming in...

1276
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:38,667
They say that Ito was gone...

1277
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:43,375
After that,
Ito's whereabouts became unknown,

1278
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,958
and had since been wanted by the police.

1279
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,875
He was also suspected
for robbing the cash transporting car

1280
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,750
while he was in the hospital...

1281
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:54,042
Then, isn't the man called Ito
the culprit...?

1282
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:58,083
Yeah...there's no doubt
that Ito shout Nishio to death...

1283
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,250
Ito's footprints were found
at the site of the shooting,

1284
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,750
as well as traces of gunpowder...

1285
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:07,625
The number of bullets that were picked up

1286
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,542
at the site matched
the maximum number of bullets

1287
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:11,250
that could be loaded in the rifle.

1288
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,500
The rifle mark also matched, but...

1289
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,250
(Forensics Office)

1290
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,458
Mascara?

1291
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,833
Although very slight,

1292
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,458
there was mascara found
on the scope of the rifle...

1293
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,458
Here it is.

1294
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:29,125
That is...
the killer looked through the scope...

1295
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,250
and the mascara smeared off then

1296
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,583
Exactly...

1297
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,875
That mascara was of a rare brand...

1298
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:40,042
So the woman
around Ito and Nishio were checked.

1299
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:44,250
One woman who used mascara
of the same brand emerged...

1300
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,958
It turned out to be Reiko Shimizu!

1301
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:50,750
Oh, that lady that committed suicide
after the incident...

1302
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,208
She was a Madonna-like symbol
of the Crime Research Yokohama club

1303
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,958
at the Yokohama Oceanic University.

1304
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:56,917
She seems to have been on very good terms

1305
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:59,958
especially with Nishio who was killed,
as well as Ito...

1306
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,292
After graduating,
she entered Ito's company along with Nishio

1307
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:05,750
and served as secretary

1308
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,167
and head of the laboratory...

1309
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:12,333
The men who robbed the cash transporting car
are Ito and Nishio, right?

1310
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:16,667
Ito may have a motive for killing Nishio,

1311
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:19,042
but, does Reiko Shimizu have one?

1312
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,042
According to one of her colleagues,

1313
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:24,542
it seems she didn't like him
because he persistently made passes at her...

1314
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:26,958
The police seemed
to have pressed her for answers

1315
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,625
on the grounds of the mascara on the scope,

1316
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:31,667
and her alibi not being clear
during the time of Nishio's murder,

1317
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,750
but she never said anything about it...

1318
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,958
And, on May 15th

1319
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,250
She jumped in!

1320
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:11,333
Although Reiko Shimizu's body
was not found...

1321
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,458
the police concluded that
since the current was rapid,

1322
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,667
there was no way she could've been saved...

1323
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:22,750
Ito disappeared from the hospital 20 days
after the incident...

1324
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:26,458
Consequently, two suspects of
the Nishio murder case disappeared,

1325
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,875
so the case was virtually closed
with no known killer...

1326
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:35,167
Of course, Ito's company,
having lost its president went bankrupt.

1327
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:37,875
The one who bought the company
is Fukayama Trading Company.

1328
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:40,750
Does it have anything to do
with Fukayama Museum

1329
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,458
that Thief Kid... stole the jewelry from?

1330
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:43,750
Of course it does...

1331
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:48,250
The president, Soichiro Fukayama
is 4 years senior to Ito and Nishio

1332
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,583
and was also a member of the same CRY club...

1333
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:53,875
It seems Ito relied a lot on Fukayama...

1334
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,083
Oh, talking about Kid, Officer Ohtaki,

1335
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,583
while he was at it,
searched something interesting for us...

1336
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:05,250
On April 4th when Thief Kid snuck
into the Fukayama Gallery,

1337
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,250
and the getaway route of the men

1338
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,667
who robbed the cash transporting car bumped
into each other

1339
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:12,583
and there seems to
have been a shoot out there...

1340
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:14,458
A shoot out?

1341
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:17,042
Well, since Kid doesn't use guns,

1342
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:20,167
I'm sure that
the robbers one-sidedly shot at him...

1343
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,458
They probably fired at him because...

1344
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,875
Thief Kid saw their faces... right...

1345
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,250
Yeah... the shell cases of

1346
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:32,750
the Colt Government and Charter Arms
were found at the site...

1347
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,792
And ever since then,

1348
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:40,042
every time Kid sneaks in to steal something
somebody comes after his life...

1349
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,958
Interesting, isn't it?

1350
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:47,750
But that's not enough to specify who
shot Mr. Nisho to death...

1351
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,833
True...

1352
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,750
We're lacking one more important something
to conclude the case...

1353
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:55,125
Come to think of it,
Kogoro called a while ago

1354
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:58,250
saying that he found an important witness...

1355
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,833
There seems to have been a custodian

1356
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:06,333
who witnessed Mr. Ito come bursting
out of the toilet with a golf bag,

1357
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:10,500
after hearing some sort
of clanking noise several times,

1358
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,667
on the day that Mr. Nishio was shot.

1359
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,750
The clanking sound was probably

1360
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,458
the sound of the shell case falling
on the floor of the toilet...

1361
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:25,375
The contents of the golf bag
was the Charter Arms AR-7...

1362
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,542
This is it, gramps.

1363
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,250
Where's Pops?

1364
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:32,750
He said he was going to report
his findings to the client

1365
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,958
because he solved the case...

1366
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,542
Don't tell me Pops...

1367
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,292
If he makes a mistake, we're in big trouble!

1368
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,042
Huh? Oh?

1369
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:43,167
Gramps, step on the gas! Full speed!

1370
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:44,667
Okay!

1371
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:13,375
I was expecting you... Thief Kid.

1372
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:20,333
I guess you tampered the ceiling
and rigged it

1373
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,667
in the afternoon preparing to rob me,

1374
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,375
but I won't let you have the jewelry...

1375
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,750
I never steal
without sending out a warning...

1376
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,875
What?

1377
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:34,583
I came here tonight to bid you farewell...

1378
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,875
Because I don't want to have people
keep coming after my life...

1379
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,333
Just as expected of you, Thief Kid.

1380
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,833
You knew all along.

1381
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,458
Yes... in a way.

1382
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,375
But, I just couldn't figure it out...

1383
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,958
Why someone would so persistently come

1384
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:51,958
after my life despite

1385
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,750
my having returned the diamond that I stole,
back to you...

1386
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,250
I've finally figured it out today...

1387
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,333
I found that you really
treasure your subordinates...

1388
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:05,458
It's your fault for having witnessed
the crime game of my dear subordinates...

1389
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:10,375
A security guard was killed
and you dare call it a game...

1390
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,750
Accidents are bound to accompany games...

1391
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,750
The fact that you witnessed them
is also one of them.

1392
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,208
If my precious subordinates come to me
with their problems,

1393
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,667
I've got to do something about it, right...?

1394
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,958
What kind of magic is that...

1395
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:45,792
Did you really think
that I would come all the way out here

1396
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,583
without making preparations?

1397
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,583
Get rid of him! Shoot Thief Kid to death!

1398
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,875
What's this...?

1399
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:07,167
Please don't worry.
It's just plain sleeping gas.

1400
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:09,167
Didn't you realize

1401
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:14,833
that I've snuck in here several times
even after I snuck in here on April 4th...?

1402
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:15,958
What?!

1403
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:24,542
And today in the light of the afternoon

1404
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:27,542
I came to rig the ceiling in order to
let you know that I would be here tonight

1405
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:32,583
as well as to lure the two killers
that you hired, out here...

1406
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:34,167
It can't be.

1407
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:37,750
If you want to defend yourself,
do so to the police that I called.

1408
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:52,625
You can do so,
along with the two dear subordinates of yours

1409
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,250
that are asleep behind this curtain...

1410
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:59,750
I guess your subordinates
were cooler than you...

1411
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:05,583
Well, I'm sure the two over there
will talk their hearts out...

1412
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:12,250
Including the truth of this gallery
that's full of stolen items...

1413
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:25,583
It's the Thief Kid!
The Thief Kid's appeared!

1414
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,167
Your game has reached goal...

1415
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,708
I guess you've ended up making
the worst goal,

1416
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,583
sending the ball into your own goal...

1417
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,667
Open up! Police! Open up!

1418
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,083
Hold on, Ran...

1419
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:16,042
Good work, Detective Mouri...

1420
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:18,583
Your client is waiting for you...

1421
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:28,750
This way...

1422
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,875
Detective Mouri is back.

1423
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,708
I know you must be tired and I'm sorry,

1424
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,292
but since there is not much time left,

1425
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:44,125
please make your report...

1426
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,542
The case you wanted me to check on

1427
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:49,708
is the case that occurred
April 4th this year on Bashamichi,

1428
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:52,208
where the cash transporting car was attacked,

1429
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:55,042
and the case related to it,
that is, the shooting of Masaharu Nishio,

1430
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,167
and the truth as to why he was shot.

1431
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:09,833
I'm going to Miracle Land
where the children are!

1432
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,833
Yeah! Take care of Kazuha for me too!

1433
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:12,958
Got you!

1434
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:18,958
The two men who attacked
the cash transporting car

1435
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,042
are Suehiko Ito and Masaharu Nishio...

1436
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:26,667
However, Nishio shot and killed
the security guard that fought back...

1437
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:32,042
Four days later,
Nishio was shot to death by someone...

1438
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,833
The police seem
to have suspected Reiko Shimizu

1439
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,708
who worked for the same company,

1440
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,833
for killing Nishio who
was making passes at her,

1441
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,750
but I don't think so...

1442
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,292
The motive of the killer was a grudge held

1443
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:46,458
against Nishio for tainting the scheme
that he had thought out...

1444
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:50,458
Yes, the one who killed Masaharu Nishio
is Ito...

1445
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,667
Hold it!

1446
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,917
Hey, you guys...

1447
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:58,250
You people, Detective Mouri
is reporting right now...

1448
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,083
Bummers...

1449
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,167
Hey... What's the matter...?

1450
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:05,375
Are you all right?

1451
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,958
Detective Mouri... Hurry, continue.

1452
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:12,167
That's why, to put it bluntly...
the man who killed Mr. Nishio is...

1453
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:16,250
Sorry, Pops.

1454
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,375
Bummers, the monitor switched off!

1455
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:20,792
Darn!

1456
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:27,083
Darn! Which button is it...?

1457
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,458
What the...

1458
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,750
Maybe the client is there...

1459
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:36,833
What?!

1460
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,667
When I called this man Takada a while ago,

1461
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:41,500
I heard a sound in the background...

1462
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,667
The same noise that
I heard from behind the client...

1463
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:46,750
I see...

1464
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,583
We don't have time, let's go!

1465
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:56,042
Talk about dark...

1466
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:58,208
We don't have time, let's go.

1467
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:17,375
Welcome...Shinichi Kudo...

1468
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,250
Heiji Hattori...

1469
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,667
Yeah... so we finally get to see each other.

1470
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,083
The president of Far East Office,

1471
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:26,167
Mr. Suehiko Ito.

1472
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:31,750
Wonderful... I was right to pair you
both together after all...

1473
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,667
It's just as we thought, after all...

1474
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,542
I'm sorry I have to greet you this way...

1475
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:37,750
I'm quite disabled, you see...

1476
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,083
It's because of the accident at the pier...

1477
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:43,917
I found out that my body
would never be normal again...

1478
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:45,583
so I came in here,

1479
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,958
I was investing backroom assets
with the help of an acquaintance.

1480
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:53,083
Miracle Land is one of them too...

1481
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,458
Mr. Soichiro Fukayama?

1482
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:59,042
Wonderful... you've figured out that far...

1483
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:01,958
I'd like to give you the report since
we don't have time, okay?

1484
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:04,833
Did you grasp the truth...

1485
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:05,958
Yes...

1486
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,833
I don't have much longer to live either.

1487
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:11,458
That's why I needed a detective
to get to the truth of the case.

1488
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:16,167
Not only one with brains,
but a tough, genuine detective.

1489
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:21,250
Come, tell me...
the truth that you both grasped.

1490
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,375
On April the 4th...

1491
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:27,167
the killer who shot Mr. Masaharu Nishio,

1492
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,667
who was at the Far East Office...

1493
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:30,958
from the toilet of
the building opposite it was...

1494
01:26:31,542 --> 01:26:33,083
Reiko Shimizu!

1495
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,958
She framed you up as being
the one who shot Masaru Nishio to death.

1496
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,667
She tried to kill you also by making it
look like an accident.

1497
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:43,000
That's a lie!

1498
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,375
I shot Nishio from the toilet!

1499
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:49,958
You guys are the same as the police,
as incapable as they are...

1500
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:55,250
It's true that you fired the rifle
from the toilet.

1501
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,833
But that is, after Reiko Shimizu shot him.

1502
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:58,833
What?!

1503
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:03,458
The 7 bullets that you fired all missed him.

1504
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:05,042
7 bullets?

1505
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:08,750
I can load 8 bullets
into that rifle you know...

1506
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:11,750
Well, but having fled as you have,
all panicked,

1507
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,833
not even picking the shell cases
from the floor,

1508
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:16,958
it's not strange that you wouldn't be aware
of exactly how many shots you fired.

1509
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:36,333
At that time,
Mr. Nishio had already been killed.

1510
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,167
That can't be!

1511
01:27:38,167 --> 01:27:39,250
I saw with my own eyes

1512
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,833
Nishio falling towards the floor
and collapse on the ground!

1513
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,083
with the bullet I fired!

1514
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,958
One of the bullets that you fired,

1515
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,833
coincidentally hit the one of
the casters of the chair and blew it off.

1516
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:52,750
Then, the bullet I fired
could've coincidentally hit Nishio too...

1517
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,833
Don't be silly.

1518
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,042
Do you think a person would sit
in place without fleeing

1519
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:57,750
after so many shots are fired at him?!

1520
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,667
Then maybe the first shot that
I fired coincidentally...

1521
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,375
The blood on the back of the chair

1522
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,750
that Mr. Nishio was sitting on
at the time of his death,

1523
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:09,167
solidified after flowing straight down
the seat part of the chair.

1524
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,250
That's how figured out
there were two shooters...

1525
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:17,250
A sniper who had fired one shot right
through the back of Mr. Nishio's head

1526
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:21,542
and after the blood that dripped solidified,

1527
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:23,750
a novice at handling guns shot
at random towards him...

1528
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:28,250
This did not help us conclude
which shots were the sniper's yet,

1529
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:31,958
but after hearing the testimony
of the witness that Pops Mouri brought in,

1530
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:33,542
everything came to light.

1531
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:38,458
After hearing several metallic sounds
from the toilet,

1532
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:42,958
the witness testified seeing you run out of
the toilet carrying a golf bag...

1533
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:46,542
The metallic sound was the shell cases
falling on the tile floor of the toilet...

1534
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:48,792
Since the witness heard
the sound several times,

1535
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:50,875
the one who shot randomly was you...

1536
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:54,375
That is, the sniper was Reiko Shimizu.

1537
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:57,083
And you were the one who shot at random,

1538
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,500
hit the leg of the chair, made him fall,

1539
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,375
and thought you killed him.

1540
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:13,167
The contents of the golf bag
was the Charter Arms AR7...

1541
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:17,458
Before the killing,
Reiko gave you that bag...

1542
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:18,750
Isn't that right?

1543
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:21,833
That's true...

1544
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:24,042
But, how does that connect with Reiko
having shot him...?

1545
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:26,667
Something was found on
the scope of the rifle she used...

1546
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:30,458
The rare brand of mascara that
Reiko Shimizu had been using.

1547
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,458
That can't be!

1548
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,083
After getting the bag from her,

1549
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:36,333
you fired all the bullets that were
in the rifle from the toilet.

1550
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:38,500
Then wanting to get rid of the car,

1551
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,667
rifle and all you headed for the pier.

1552
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:47,375
Reiko is probably also the one who tampered
with your car and caused the crash...

1553
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,458
Her motive was probably to hog all the money

1554
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:53,750
that was taken from the attack on
the cash transporting car for herself...

1555
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:58,750
She was in the car when you guys attacked
and robbed the car, wasn't she?

1556
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,667
You encountered Thief Kid when fleeing
in the getaway car.

1557
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:04,750
Since he saw your faces,

1558
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:06,750
you decided to shut him up.

1559
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,333
However, since he lured you guys
into a crooked back road,

1560
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:12,167
you panicked and fired at him.

1561
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:14,833
They seem to have found the shell case of

1562
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,375
the Colt Government on that back road...

1563
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:20,167
No matter
how good your driving technique is,

1564
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:22,958
driving along a crooked back road
with one hand,

1565
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,542
and trying to fire at Thief Kid

1566
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:27,167
who is flying over the sky
is an impossible feat

1567
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,750
That means that two people
other than you were in the car,

1568
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,875
one with a rifle and the other
with the Colt Government.

1569
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:38,083
In other words, Mr. Masaharu Nishio
and Ms. Reiko Shimiuzu were with you.

1570
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,042
Well, we got most of the evidence

1571
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:43,750
that were used to back this deduction up
from the police,

1572
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,333
and as for the witness Pops Mouri
came up with,

1573
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:49,458
if it were the police
they could've got to him sooner.

1574
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:51,542
Therefore, I think the police with allthis
in their hands,

1575
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:54,375
went after Reiko Shimizu

1576
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:55,667
Yes...

1577
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:59,375
in this case,
it was not necessary to search for

1578
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:03,458
a brilliant police officer
or capable detective to begin with...

1579
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,042
So, the case has been solved.

1580
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:08,375
Please remove the IDs of Ran and the others.

1581
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:12,667
That's a lie...
Reiko would never do such a thing...

1582
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:16,292
It's a lie... A lie... A lie!

1583
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:17,958
It's not a lie.

1584
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,958
So, you were alive after all...

1585
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,542
Reiko... Is it you, Reiko!

1586
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:29,042
You were not sufficient enough...

1587
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:31,750
to be my partner...

1588
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,833
Neither was Nishio.

1589
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,750
He was merely violent...

1590
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,458
Staying around to long
would put me in danger.

1591
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,042
You're too timid, Ito...

1592
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:45,542
And all you ever do
is brag about yourself...

1593
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,958
You weren't fun to be around...

1594
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,875
You gathered detectives

1595
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:53,292
and it looked as if you were going
to protect me from the crimes I committed

1596
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:54,750
so I let you go till now...

1597
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,167
But, today, it all ends.

1598
01:31:56,833 --> 01:31:59,667
Your assets that Mr. Fukayama was managing
for you,

1599
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:02,583
can now be used by me...

1600
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:04,458
With Mr. Fukayama...

1601
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,958
Mr. Fukayama is already gone...

1602
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:09,792
He was gotten rid of by Thief Kid...

1603
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:12,250
I'm the one who will make it

1604
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:14,667
through after all!

1605
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,083
Hey, hold it right there!

1606
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,833
Shinichi! Don't move.

1607
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:24,542
That's a Walther PPK.

1608
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:26,250
There are 8 bullets!

1609
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,167
After she fires all the shots,
I'll settle things once and for all.

1610
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,375
6...

1611
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:34,875
7...

1612
01:32:35,167 --> 01:32:35,750
8...!

1613
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,750
Now!

1614
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,375
Heiji!

1615
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:44,083
I'm sorry... I'm ambidextrous.

1616
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:54,167
Use this! Shinichi!

1617
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:56,167
You don't need a balance point in mid air,
do you!

1618
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:57,083
I get it!

1619
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:17,458
Reiko...

1620
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:19,750
Reiko, what's the matter?...

1621
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,833
What's wrong, Reiko?

1622
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:22,958
Reiko...!

1623
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,875
Please undo the IDs.

1624
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,750
I click release?...

1625
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,583
Yeah, call an ambulance right now.

1626
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:43,250
What?!

1627
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:44,458
What's up?

1628
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:47,875
Error?!

1629
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,375
More complications.

1630
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,667
Hey, Shinichi,
you know what you're doing, or what?

1631
01:33:57,667 --> 01:33:59,458
Not all of them are dead.

1632
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,750
We've no choice
but to look for the live ones.

1633
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,042
I think my time has come...

1634
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:10,083
Kudo... Your voice sounds like a child's,

1635
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:13,167
Heiji! Is the error still on display?

1636
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,375
Yeah, it hasn't changed.

1637
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:21,333
It's set so that
it'll explode when the time comes.

1638
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:22,583
What time is that?

1639
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,583
10:00 sharp.

1640
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:28,083
Darn... Which one do I touch...?

1641
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,667
I really wanted to ride Super Snake.

1642
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,333
It was out of order right through.

1643
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:39,792
My dessert sure is late.

1644
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:43,750
Don' t complain because after all
the Inspector is treating us to all this.

1645
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,958
Inspector Megure sure is generous.

1646
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,042
Generously plump.

1647
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:48,167
True...

1648
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:55,583
Uh...Inspector Megure, did something happen?

1649
01:34:56,167 --> 01:34:57,333
Huh, what about...?

1650
01:34:57,333 --> 01:34:58,542
Because...

1651
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:00,667
the police officers are gathered here...

1652
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:02,167
Oh, well...

1653
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,375
Inspector Megure...

1654
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:05,958
Oh, Inspector Shiratori...

1655
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:07,667
I'm sorry, Ran.

1656
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:10,875
How about it...?

1657
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:15,750
All the people here and
the restaurant employees have been evacuated,

1658
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:19,667
so the ones left here are those children
and we, the police.

1659
01:35:19,667 --> 01:35:20,750
I see...

1660
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:27,958
What's taking you so long, Shinichi...

1661
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:35,750
Darn!

1662
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:38,708
The relationship between
a man a woman deepens...

1663
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,167
when a common secret... is held...

1664
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:43,875
The deepest secret is
to be an accomplice in a crime...

1665
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:47,583
with the woman one is in love with...

1666
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:51,333
That's why... attacking the
cash transporting car with Reiko

1667
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,750
was a display of my love for her.

1668
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,167
But, because Nishio shot the security guard,

1669
01:35:57,167 --> 01:36:00,083
my perfect scheme was no more...

1670
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,875
There is no such thing as perfect
in this world.

1671
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,375
At one point things are going to
start falling out of place...

1672
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,042
It's up to the person whether you move on
forcing your way through as is,

1673
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:10,958
and lose everything

1674
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,542
or you reset everything once,
returning things to normal,

1675
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:16,542
and work hard to regain the time you lost...

1676
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:19,750
You were just scared...

1677
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:22,958
to reset yourself.

1678
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:28,583
That could be...

1679
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:37,875
Will it work...

1680
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,750
What's this?

1681
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:52,375
Unless the time is undone,
the ID cannot be removed.

1682
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:54,083
Darn!...

1683
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:58,375
Are you all right?

1684
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:01,167
You still don't feel well?

1685
01:37:01,542 --> 01:37:03,583
No, I'm fine...

1686
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:07,375
Oh... If you feel bad,
let me know right away, okay?

1687
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,250
Yes... I'll do that...

1688
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:14,542
Conan didn't after all, huh.

1689
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:17,250
He went along with
Detective Mouri after all...

1690
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,667
I mean, no fair, going all by himself!

1691
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:22,958
Stealing a march
is one of Conan’s talents...

1692
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:28,042
Did you get any word from Mr. Mouri?

1693
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:28,958
No...

1694
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,667
I see...

1695
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,583
I'm going in at 1 minute to 10:00.

1696
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:38,667
I can't just leave the children in there
by themselves...

1697
01:37:40,542 --> 01:37:41,583
True...

1698
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:44,250
9:56...

1699
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,542
there's not much time left, Shinichi.

1700
01:37:46,042 --> 01:37:49,208
-I get it! He's using wireless LAN.
-Y, Yeah...

1701
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:53,458
If the wireless LAN isn't working,
if the cables are directly connected,

1702
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:54,667
it may work!

1703
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:09,250
A little more.

1704
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:10,250
Okay,

1705
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,583
it reached!

1706
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,542
Okay, it worked!

1707
01:38:14,542 --> 01:38:15,667
All right!

1708
01:38:15,667 --> 01:38:17,458
Undo...time!

1709
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:20,250
Enter password.

1710
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,583
Hey! Pass...

1711
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,708
Hey Shinichi! He's

1712
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,708
Don't worry, he's just passed out.

1713
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,333
It's probably an after effect
from the accident...

1714
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:31,833
What is the name of the person
you love the most...?

1715
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,167
10: 59...

1716
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:41,000
You stay here.

1717
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:42,958
Y, Yes sir...

1718
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,750
Scary, right?

1719
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,750
I wasn't scared at all!

1720
01:38:48,042 --> 01:38:50,667
How was it, did you enjoy the day?

1721
01:38:50,667 --> 01:38:53,458
Too bad we couldn't ride Super Snake.

1722
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:56,958
But the one like a rocket was fun!

1723
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:59,667
Yeah! I want to ride it again!

1724
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:01,708
Ito's in love with Reiko Shimizu!

1725
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:05,958
Wrong password.

1726
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:06,958
What?!

1727
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:10,250
Reiko Shimizu is no the one he loves?!

1728
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:11,833
Wrong password.

1729
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:12,750
If the next password is wrong
the system will shut down.

1730
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,583
There isn't anymore time left, Shinichi!

1731
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,667
Who is it?

1732
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,667
The person that Ito loves...

1733
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:19,875
Who...?

1734
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:30,750
And all you ever do is brag about yourself...

1735
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:34,167
But, because Nishio shot the security guard,

1736
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:36,750
my perfect scheme was no more...

1737
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:38,167
I got it!

1738
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:41,500
W, What're you keying in, Shinichi?!

1739
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:01,917
The timer has been undone.

1740
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,458
Is it all over?

1741
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,250
Yeah...this is it. It's over.

1742
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:13,458
Good work, Shinichi.

1743
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,667
I was able to undo the time bomb device,

1744
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:17,750
but was unable to undo the area setting.

1745
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:21,542
So, make sure you retrieve all the IDs,
every one of them, okay, Doc?

1746
01:40:21,542 --> 01:40:23,750
Yeah, I'll retrieve all of them right away.

1747
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:28,458
Kudo... and Hattori...

1748
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:32,250
you two are the best...
detectives that ever were...

1749
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,375
You are...the worst of any human being.

1750
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,750
Are you all okay?

1751
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:49,250
Okay, take off your IDs and put it in here!

1752
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,667
We have to take it off...?

1753
01:40:51,667 --> 01:40:53,958
It's closing time already, you see.

1754
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,542
Too bad...

1755
01:40:55,542 --> 01:40:57,750
Handkerchief... Handkerchief...

1756
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:01,375
Huh? I thought I lost it, but...Huh?

1757
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:03,875
I wonder what this is...?

1758
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:08,250
It looks like paint...
I wonder where I got it on...

1759
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,542
Okay, your ID please.

1760
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:10,833
Oh...that...

1761
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:13,667
The Super Snake that had been
out of order today has been repaired.

1762
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:16,750
Although it is already past closing time,

1763
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,833
we will be running it one last time.

1764
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:21,458
Those wanting to ride it,

1765
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:25,333
please gather immediately.

1766
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:26,958
Aaaaaa... All right...!

1767
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:29,167
Are you okay, Heiji?

1768
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,875
Don't worry, it's no more than a scratch!

1769
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:36,542
I wonder why he thought
you were Shinichi Kudo?

1770
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,292
This.

1771
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,667
This... your fingerprint?

1772
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:42,875
Do you remember the chair in that room?

1773
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:46,750
I remember because it was so out of place
with the entire atmosphere of the room.

1774
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,958
The armrest of the chair bothered me.

1775
01:41:50,542 --> 01:41:55,667
Most likely, on the armrest part...
a fingerprint recognition device was built-in

1776
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:00,958
This fingerprint is of Shinichi Kudo.

1777
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:04,042
If the client had a visual disability,

1778
01:42:04,042 --> 01:42:07,167
it's possible
that he thought I was Shinichi Kudo.

1779
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:08,542
I see.

1780
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:13,042
Oh... No... It's after 10:00!

1781
01:42:13,042 --> 01:42:15,167
It'll explode...!

1782
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,750
Your ID belt will come off.

1783
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:18,667
Huh, belt?

1784
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:22,875
This, this,

1785
01:42:24,833 --> 01:42:26,167
Oh, yeah, really...

1786
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:28,042
What a relief...

1787
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,042
Retreived!

1788
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,375
Hey, wait!

1789
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,750
I tell you...

1790
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:38,167
With him acting that way,
I guess the case is closed.

1791
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:41,042
By the way, let me down already, will you.

1792
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:43,542
Don't push yourself,
your leg hurts, doesn't it?

1793
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:51,333
Right. Being piggy-backed by a girl
is the best cure for his leg so...

1794
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,167
Why you! Darn it!

1795
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:54,708
Brat...

1796
01:42:55,167 --> 01:42:58,667
Inspector, we've retrieved all the IDs.

1797
01:42:58,667 --> 01:43:00,042
The figures matched too.

1798
01:43:00,042 --> 01:43:00,667
Okay.

1799
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:02,250
Give them to the bomb disassembling section.

1800
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,167
Don't let anyone see what you're doing.

1801
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:04,750
Yes sir!

1802
01:43:06,167 --> 01:43:08,833
Okay... Super Snake or what,

1803
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,250
anything goes...!

1804
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:12,458
Enjoy...

1805
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,167
Lucky...

1806
01:43:18,167 --> 01:43:20,667
We have it all to ourselves...!

1807
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,667
Heiji, I'm happy for you.

1808
01:43:23,667 --> 01:43:25,667
They say they sell underpants here too.

1809
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:27,750
Idiot! I won't piss in my pants.

1810
01:43:33,542 --> 01:43:35,875
Okay everybody... raise your hands.

1811
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:38,833
How exciting!

1812
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:40,958
If you're scared you don't have to let go...

1813
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,250
Who's scared?

1814
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,375
I not only can let my hands go,
I don't even need this bar...

1815
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:53,167
No! No! No!

1816
01:43:53,167 --> 01:43:53,833
Ha, ha, ha, ha,

1817
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:55,750
Heiji, you're so funny.

1818
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,333
Ooooh, you...

1819
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:58,333
Genta, take it off...!

1820
01:43:58,333 --> 01:43:59,542
Genta...

1821
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:00,958
What do you think you're doing?!

1822
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:02,542
Hurry and take it off!

1823
01:44:02,542 --> 01:44:03,667
If you keep going like this

1824
01:44:03,667 --> 01:44:06,250
we're going out to sea
where it's out of range...!

1825
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,375
Genta...

1826
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:10,167
H, Hey, what do you think you're doing?...

1827
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:11,542
You'll die if you move.

1828
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:12,958
O, Okay.

1829
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:24,750
Okay!

1830
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:31,958
Shinichi!

1831
01:44:31,958 --> 01:44:32,875
Behind me!

1832
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:38,958
Bummers...

1833
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,542
Go for it!

1834
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:56,583
No! Stop him!

1835
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:57,042
Huh?!

1836
01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:59,750
No good! The safety bars all work together!

1837
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:00,750
If you break one,
then all will stop functioning...

1838
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:03,875
Everybody else's bar will...

1839
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,167
This is super...

1840
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:35,042
I didn't think we'd get to see fireworks too.

1841
01:45:35,042 --> 01:45:36,667
Special service, I guess?

1842
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:38,750
I... somehow can't enjoy myself...

1843
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,875
Hey... don't tell me that he...

1844
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,875
Yeah... I think... that's most likely...

1845
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:55,042
I tell you, that Ryu...

1846
01:49:55,042 --> 01:49:58,042
He pretended to be dead after they offered
to pay him a large amount of cash...

1847
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:04,042
The names of the two detectives
he mentioned back then were just bluffs.

1848
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:09,750
I can't figure how people would go that far
just for money... How wretched...

1849
01:50:15,958 --> 01:50:17,875
Yes, the Mouri Detective Agency...

1850
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:20,458
Act in a commercial?

1851
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:23,750
And? What kind of commercial is it...?

1852
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:26,750
What? Commercial for sleeping pills?

1853
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,333
It's easy because I always do it...?!

1854
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:30,458
You gotta be joking!

1855
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:32,250
Just who do you think I am?!

1856
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,250
No matter how much guarantee
you say you'll give me...

1857
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:37,167
T, That much?...

1858
01:50:38,667 --> 01:50:41,542
Well... Please by all means let me do it...

1859
01:50:41,542 --> 01:50:42,958
Yes... Yes...

1860
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:43,958
Just as I thought...

1861
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:46,750
As would be expected of
the Sleeping Kogoro...

1862
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,375
I'd be more than happy to!
