1
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,769
Damn it. Where'd he go?

2
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:55,969
Gotchya!

3
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,769
The game is over, Mr. Thief

4
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,269
Definitely

5
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:35,869
It's too dark to play Hide and Seek

6
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,969
Detective brother

7
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,669
I am Senior Detective Shinichi Kudo

8
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,569
When I was visiting the amusement park
with my best mate Ran Mouri

9
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:25,569
Witnessed the deal scene of the man in black

10
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,345
At the time I was only concentrating
on peeking the deal

11
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:31,369
But I neglected the other guy coming from my back

12
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,169
I was poisoned by that man

13
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:36,869
When I came to

14
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,669
My body's already turned small

15
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,345
If they know Shinichi Kudo is still alive

16
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:44,845
My life will be in danger

17
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:46,669
And also my relatives around will be jeopardized

18
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:50,269
Under Dr. Agasa's suggestion, I hid my identity

19
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,145
When Ran asked about my name

20
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,669
In an emergency, I used the alias Edogawa Conan

21
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,845
In order to collect those guy's information

22
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,869
I moved to Ran's place, her father's a detective

23
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:05,869
The criminal is you

24
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,769
This man is called Mouri Kogoro

25
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,069
He is Ran's father

26
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,869
Now he is a very tough well-known detective

27
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,769
People call him slumbering Kogoro

28
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,769
About its reason

29
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,369
Needless to say, I guess you all know it

30
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,669
Watch narcotic gun Cravat toner
These two props were invented by Dr. Agasa

31
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,469
In order to help the smalled me,
Dr. Agasa had invented a few handy props

32
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,569
Especially this football ejecting belt

33
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,769
Just press the button on the belt

34
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,069
Then the football will be expanded
and ejected, superb prop

35
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,269
Oh, yea

36
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,269
Besides the Doctor there are still
a few know who I am

37
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,469
My parents

38
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,169
Kansai Senior Detective Hattori Heiji

39
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:09,169
And Ai Haibara who was
in the same elementary school with me

40
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,069
She and her sister Miyano Akemi
were the complices of the man in black

41
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,169
But Miyano Akemi was killed by the organization

42
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,969
Haibara was very unhappy about this.
When she fled from the organization

43
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,769
She was forced to drink the same poison as me,
and therefore also got shrinked

44
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,269
There's another one

45
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,069
Kaitou Kiddo

46
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:38,169
We haven't gotten even yet

47
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,569
Bet the reputation of a well-known detective

48
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,969
I am sure to try him this time

49
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,269
The body is smaller
but the brain is still the same good

50
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,269
A famous detective without maze

51
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,669
There's always only one truth

52
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,269
Aha, I see

53
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,769
Is this the warning letter sent by Kiddo?

54
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,069
Yes

55
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,069
This morning on the balcony of my home

56
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,469
(Maki Jyuri (37) Actress)
Put together with a big bunch of rose

57
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:14,869
Hemhem

58
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,169
That guy still likes bumbling

59
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,369
Romeo Juliet

60
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:22,669
Victor Bravo

61
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,669
In the 26 scattered flying letters

62
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,169
(Yaguchi Masayo (32) Manager)
I will come and take the Sapphire of Fate

63
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,669
Kaitou Kiddo

64
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,169
And a torn poker card

65
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,369
Here you are

66
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:38,969
Thank you

67
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,269
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

68
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,069
Not quite clear

69
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,569
"The Sapphire of Fate" refers to...

70
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,269
It refers to this

71
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,469
Wow, so beautiful

72
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,345
This is a sapphire, right?

73
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,069
Yes

74
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,469
The three interleaving lines on the surface

75
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:18,669
stand for "belief", "hope" and "fate" respectively

76
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,469
It's called The Sapphire of Fate

77
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,169
Aha

78
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,945
So beautiful

79
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,869
Because Josephine loves this sapphire very much

80
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,069
She used the sapphire in the show this time too

81
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:33,769
The show?

82
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,269
I know

83
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:42,269
Your living drama in the new
Universal Theater in Shiodome, Josephine

84
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,869
Josephine?

85
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,669
That's Napoleon's first queen

86
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,769
She's also known to be a rose-lover

87
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,369
I see, so roses are sent

88
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,145
Exactly kid, you know very well

89
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,569
Not actually.
He only knows a little useless knowledge

90
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,245
Romeo Juliet

91
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,869
Victor Bravo

92
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,269
Romeo Juliet

93
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:21,469
In the tree?

94
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,069
Yes?

95
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:27,045
Now in your show theater

96
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,545
Romeo and Juliet?

97
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,469
Yes

98
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,445
Although I didn't take part of the show

99
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,269
That happened to be first performance
in public of the theater

100
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:35,969
Any problems?

101
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,069
I know the answer now

102
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,469
Really?

103
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,269
The foretell letter sent here by Kiddo

104
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,245
has 3 W's and 1 H

105
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:49,969
That is to say

106
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:52,669
Who

107
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:53,469
When

108
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:54,169
Where

109
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,146
How

110
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,145
These words are to imply us

111
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,669
I see

112
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,669
Hey, any problems?

113
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,769
Above all, who

114
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,769
This is Kiddo for sure

115
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,669
Then where

116
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,445
The performance of Romeo and Juliet
takes place in the Universal Theater

117
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,669
Then when

118
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,545
The foretell letter mentioned about Bravo

119
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,269
So it is when the spectators bravo

120
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,169
Finally how

121
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,369
The letter mentioned about Victor

122
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,145
It refers to Napoleon

123
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,069
The role Kiddo will play

124
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,769
Then it's poker card in the foretell letter

125
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,569
The card's torn into two meaning Victory V

126
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,645
So after your drama of Josephine

127
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,069
when the spectators bravo

128
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:50,169
Kaitou Kiddo will show up disguised
as Napoleon and steal the ring

129
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,469
Bravo

130
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,869
Bravo, Mr. Mouri, creditably well-known detective

131
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,769
Just so so

132
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,569
Uncle

133
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,369
What are the 26 scattered flying letters?

134
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:11,469
You fool, count the letters on it

135
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,569
Romeo Juliet Victor Bravo

136
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,969
Aren't they totally 26 letters?

137
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,069
It's like this

138
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,069
Ah yeah, in the tree

139
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:24,745
When will the play of Josephine end?

140
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,469
Today is the last play

141
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,145
Then Kiddo will...

142
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,569
Weird

143
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,369
Dumb kid, what is it now?

144
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,069
But it's so weird

145
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,769
Look, here are only 22 letters

146
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,369
How come?

147
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:42,969
It's true, I've also counted it

148
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,445
Lack of 3 even if I count the excalmatory mark

149
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:49,869
Then Kiddo must have been wrong

150
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:51,669
Hey...

151
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:01,769
Anyway Kiddo will surely come
and steal the Sapphire tonight

152
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,769
OK, I know

153
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,769
I have something to discuss with you

154
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,769
Of course the police will then be here too

155
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,769
Can I invite you to the theater tonight

156
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:16,669
to stop Kiddo from stealing the sapphire?

157
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,269
No problem

158
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,669
I, Mouri Kogoro

159
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:25,069
never rejected beauty's entrust

160
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,269
Thank you very much

161
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,145
Masayo, take it out

162
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,169
Yes

163
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,469
Here're the tickets for tonight

164
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,269
Welcome you to come with your friends

165
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,569
Thank you

166
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:48,069
In the 26 scattered flying letters?

167
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:51,969
The 26 letters must refer to the alphabet

168
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,969
And this poker card

169
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,669

Universal Theater

172
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,645
I am so excited

173
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:11,769
Me too

174
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,869
Actually I've wanted to watch the drama for long

175
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,169
Hey, Conan

176
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,269
Why do you have that bag on your back?

177
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,669
It's troublesome

178
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,569
It's ok

179
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,469
What's inside?

180
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:30,369
You brought cracks along?

181
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:31,969
I'm not like you

182
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,469
Hey, you guys

183
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,545
I've broken the rules to take you here

184
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,169
Show some politeness

185
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,769
OK

186
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,569
I'm sorry. I come here too

187
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,269
Don't mention

188
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:47,969
Mouri

189
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,369
Sorry, kept you waiting for long

190
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,569
Hello, Yaguchi

191
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,569
I'm Yaguchi, Mr. Mouri has come

192
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:01,569
Come in please

193
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:03,969
Come in please

194
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,169
Thanks

195
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,869
Welcome Mr. Mouri

196
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,169
Hello

197
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,269
Sorry that I am not very tidy now

198
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:15,169
Natuki, This is the famous Mouri Kogoro

199
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,669
You must have heard of him

(Sakai Natuki (26) Hair Maker)
My name's Sakai Natuki

Hello

202
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,269
It's so spacious here

203
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,545
So many flowers

204
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,769
Great!

205
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,345
I'm sorry

206
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:34,269
That I've brought the children along

207
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,969
Don't worry, it's OK

208
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,369
Jyuri, Do you dive?

209
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,769
Yes, I've just started to learn

210
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,869
Shall we call it a day to go together?

211
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,869
Great, I will go for sure

212
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,369
You obviously haven't dived

213
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,569
What did you say, Ran?

214
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,069
Nothing

215
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:01,745
Wow

216
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:03,969
So much cosmetic

217
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,869
Yeah

218
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,069
This is called foundation make-up

219
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:12,169
Exactly

220
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:14,069
Barely foundation make-up...

221
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:18,569
5 kinds

222
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:19,545
So many? 5 kinds?

223
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:20,369
Hey!

224
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,069
Little sisters!

225
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,769
You are too young to learn make-up

226
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:36,569
Behave as the kids you are

227
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:37,469
Understood?

228
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,569
Yes

229
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,069
I'm coming

ć

232
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:55,369
I've heard that Mouri has come

233
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,369
Ah

234
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,469
Mouri

235
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,369
You are the well-known detective Mouri Kogoro?

(Narusawa Bunjirou (34) Actor)
My name's Narusawa, I adore you very much

237
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,569
Thank you

238
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,869
You will play as Napolean, right?

239
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:11,569
Yes

240
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,569
I'm very sorry that
I'm still in theatrical costume

241
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,069
Ah, let me introduce to you

242

(Tajima Tenko (36) Actress)
as Josephine's good friend - Teresa Terrian

244
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,969
How do you do?

Hello

And then the director
and the the sponsor of Josephine

(Ban Tohru (45) Director and Actor)
My name is Ban Tohru, how do you do?

251
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:39,469
How do you do?

252
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,769
Is everyone here?

253
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,369
Officer Nakamori

254
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,269
Hello, Mouri

255
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,669
How've you been?

256
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:53,369
Thank you for the last time

257
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,269
Don't mention, I should thank you

258
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,769
Are they themselves?

259
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:14,469
Definitely

260
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:19,669
Kiddo always disguises
as related personnel in advance

261
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:23,169
Maybe he's already among these people

262
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,469
I nearly forgot

263
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,369
This time I specially took someone
to assist the investigation

264
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:34,669
I said no, but damned Megure...

265
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,769
No

266
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,769
It's because Officer Megure
strongly recommend him

267
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,369
Come on in

268
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,369
Hi everyone, I am Kuto Shinichi

269
00:16:58,869 --> 00:16:59,746
Shinich?

270
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,869
Kuto?

271
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,669
Weird... weird...

272
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,769
This brat

273
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:07,569
Kuto Shinich is...

274
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,869
That well-known Senior Detective?

275
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,469
Weird... weird...

276
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,869
Who is he?

277
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,469
What are you talking about?

278
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,869
He is sis Ran's boyfriend

279
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,245
He is not!

280
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:20,845
Her husband

281
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,846
Sonoko!

282
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,269
He is Kaitou Kiddo

283
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,369
This guy is not brother Shinich

284
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,069
He's Kiddo disguised

285
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,269
Kiddo disguised?

286
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,269
How do you know that?

287
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:34,969
Because I am the real...

288
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,169
Real what?

289
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,269
Nothing...

290
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,169
I see. That's possible as well

291
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,346
It hurts!

292
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,069
Officer Nakamori, stop!

293
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,469
What's going on?

294
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:55,869
I don't know either

295
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,545
Maybe Kiddo does look like me

296
00:17:58,569 --> 00:17:59,869
Or...

297
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:03,169
You are the fake one

298
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:04,869
Hey...

299
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:09,169
OK. Now we can be sure he's real

300
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,469
I think we pull everyone's face by the way

301
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,069
No, it's not necessary

302
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,069
I feel that Kiddo is not among us

303
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,869
Obviously he is

304
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:28,469
And I already have a good idea to catch Kiddo

305
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,169
Haha

306
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,969
Then please speak out

307
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:38,369
Ms. Maki,
I'd like to have the others to go out first

308
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,669
Never mind, Officer

309
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:42,769
Anyway I am ready

310
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:43,945
Ah

311
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:44,669
Excuse me

312
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,369
I want to catch the criminal in my way

313
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,569
What did you say?

314
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:52,869
That's right. Little detective, don't make trouble.

315
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,369
Then we are going out first

316
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,669
Looking forward to your brilliant performance

317
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,069
Wait

318
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,169
Now that you've come,
you should have informed me in advance

319
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,869
Sorry

320
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,045
Because I wanted to give you a surprise

321
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:20,669
Cute

322
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,369
You guys are talking so sweet

323
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:28,869
I'm going to the roof

324
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,969
Do you want to come, Ran?

325
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,869
The garret seems to be an observatory

326
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,069
Come on go, Ran

327
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,545
I want to go too

328
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:40,769
You can't go there

329
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,845
I do, I want to go too

330
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,145
Stop it

331
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,045
I want to go too

332
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,969
All right, everyone go together

333
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,369
Great

334
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,169
Don't you feel Conan...

335
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,269
looks like another in front of sis Ran?

336
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:00,769
I suppose he's at a peevish age

337
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:02,045
Aha, I see

338
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,745
He's really like a brat

339
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,269
You are brats too

340
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,669
How could I let Kiddo and Ran be together alone

341
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:24,245
OK, here's locked also

342
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:24,869
Yea

343
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,469
How's it?

344
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,769
The doors to the roof are all locked

345
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:43,769
Aha

346
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:47,269
If my consequence is correct

347
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,469
Kiddo will come from the roof

348
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:53,869
Probably

349
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:57,769
Obviously already here

350
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:05,769
Ran

351
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,469
I'll take care of Conan

352
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,669
You two can take a walk around

353
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,069
No

354
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:13,769
Besides...

355
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,169
I feel Shinichi's weird

356
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,769
He never talked like that before

357
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,169
Like what?

358
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,569
Like say that I... I'm cute

359
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,969
That means he's more frank now

360
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:33,869
You should be more frank too

361
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,169
You should tell him if you really like him

362
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,169
Fool, I don't mean that

363
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,769
Great great

364
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,669
Gentai, why do you keep saying great?

365
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,445
I can't help

366
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:50,469
It's really great

367
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,969
It's so beautiful here

368
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,669
Certainly can be described only by great

369
00:21:58,269 --> 00:21:58,969
Look

370
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,169
Yeah, so great

371
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:09,969
How dare he disguised as Shinichi

372
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:11,269
Yea

373
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:15,369
Maybe it's easier to handle if disguised as me

374
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,069
But at least we save time looking for him

375
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:18,969
Yea

376
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:24,269
Do you know who Napoleon is?

377
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,369
Yes, I do

378
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,469
He's the French hero used to conquer the Europe

379
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:31,469
OK...

380
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,369
Take it like a preview before the drama

381
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,069
I am telling a riddle related to Napoleon

382
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,869
Brother Shinich's going to tell a riddle

383
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,069
Looks like Dr. Agasa

384
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,169
Don't be a bad joke again

385
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,969
My riddle is related to history,
you can learn something from it

386
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,869
Think it together kid

387
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,469
Nonsense

388
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,569
Listen up

389
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:55,169
On Napoleon's soil

390
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:57,669
It's said that two Japanese built up houses

391
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,969
Do you know which two in the following?

392
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:02,869
1. Huyuno

393
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,669
2. Huruno

394
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,869
3. Hukano

395
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,269
Huyuno Huruno Hukano

396
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:14,569
Everyone has FU and NO

397
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,445
I got it!

398
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,369
Sh...

399
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:18,569
Don't tell

400
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:23,669
The difference between the three is YU,
RU and KA in the middle

401
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,669
I know it, it's Huyuno and Huruno

402
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,469
Only Hukano has KA in the middle

403
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:32,769
KA in the middle means China

404
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,369
So Hukano was Chinese

405
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:42,169
What? Am I wrong?

406
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,369
The answer is right,
but it's not the right reason

407
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:48,545
Do you know the famous saying by Napoleon?

408
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:52,169
"In my dictionary
there's no such word impossible"

409
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:52,869
Ah

410
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,169
I've heard it

411
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,769
This riddle is from that saying

412
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,369
Tochi(soil) is also called Jishyo(dictionary)

413
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:03,069
"Word" refers to the name on the doorpalte

414
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,269
In other word is "In my soil(Tochi)
there's no such word Hukano(impossible)".

415
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:09,669
It's like this

416
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,569
Actually Napoleon should have said

417
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:16,669
"Hukano(impossible) can only be
in the fools' dictionaries"

418
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,169
This is the right way to say it

419
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,269
Haibara is so awesome

420
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,169
But still a bad joke

421
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:24,545
Besides...

422
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,069
Is this something to learn from?

423
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:28,669
Isn't it?

424
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,469
Josephine, Teresa

425
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:30,169
Barras, Do you have anything?

426
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,669
General, let's me introduce to you

427
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,245
These are Teresa and Josephine

428
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,869
I know who you are

429
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,169
You are General Napoleon Bonaparte

430
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:43,969
I've heard that you are very brave

431
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:46,269
Overpraised

432
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,869
General, Would you like to have a dance with me?

433
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,369
My pleasure

434
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:53,169
I've kept in my mind till now

435
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:57,069
Those splendid memories

436
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:59,169
Bonaparte

437
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:00,969
Elba Island

438
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,469
Roman King

439
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:33,969
Ran

440
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,769
Is the man beside the pontificate your father?

441
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,769
This is your good idea to catch Kiddo?

442
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:55,669
Haibara, you stay here

443
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,569
Bye

444
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,169
I in the name of the holy father,
holy son and the holy ghost

445
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:06,769
Present this crown
which stands for the French King

446
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:15,269
I am the French King, Napoleon the first

447
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,869
Kid, are you all right?

448
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,169
It's very dangerous like this

449
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:22,769
Yep

450
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,569
I'm fine

451
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:24,745
Oh, yea

452
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,669
What?

453
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:28,169
Nothing

454
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:30,969
This kid ran out from the corner

455
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:33,869
rammed with me and fell down

456
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:36,769
Kid, are you all right?

457
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:38,569
I'm fine

458
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,969
But brother's baton looks so cool

459
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,869
much longer than this uncle's

460
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,669
Yea, pretty long

461
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,745
There are all types of batons

462
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,469
Shorter than 60 cm in length

463
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,169
Slenderer than 3 cm in diameter

464
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:56,569
Lighter than 320 grams in weight

465
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,769
Thare are strict rules
to the batons by PSCs everywhere

466
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:05,969
Your baton seems to be too long

467
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,569
Why?

468
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,269
Why too long?

469
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:17,369
That's is because

470
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:19,469
This is not a baton

471
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,569
You can't get away

472
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:30,469
Wait

473
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:33,569
Damn

474
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:51,869
Everything in this world

475
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:53,669
Glory

476
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,169
Victory

477
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,869
And future all belong to me

478
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,669
Everything belongs to us

479
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,445
Wait untill the purdah fully set then action

480
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:32,469
I know

481
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,245
Now, everyone catch Kiddo

482
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,769
He disguised as Napoleon

483
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:48,969
What do they want to do?

484
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,869
Kiddo, didn't you anticipate this?

485
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,369
Your stupid secret sign

486
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:01,769
has been seen through by me Mouri Kogoro

487
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:03,969
No, I am not Kiddo

488
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:05,146
Cut the crap

489
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,469
Show yourself you Kaitou Kiddo

490
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,369
It hurts!

491
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:17,069
He's not Kiddo

492
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,869
Then where is Kiddo?

493
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:37,169
The game is over, Mr. Thief

494
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:39,769
Definitely

495
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:45,169
It's too dark to play Hide and Seek

496
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,069
Detective brother

497
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,969
You can only lie now

498
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:00,669
Let's get it even

499
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:04,969
All right

500
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:08,069
Because your girl has made dinner waiting for you

501
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:09,869
Conan

502
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,969
Dinner's ready

503
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:14,269
Damn

504
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,969
It'll be eaten up if you don't come fast

505
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:41,969
It seems we can get it even today,
detective brother

506
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:43,469
Yeah

507
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:44,769
I thinking so too

508
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:17,469
No

509
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,769
Hey hey

510
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:29,869
Aha

511
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:32,869
Glider vs. Flying parachute

512
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:35,469
It's really something

513
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:37,569
The flying parachute you used just now

514
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,869
Another invention by Dr. Agasa?

515
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:41,869
You are already cornered

516
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,869
If can't fly

517
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:46,169
Kaitou Kiddo is just a normal thief

518
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:54,569
Then I turn back to the Kaitou before

519
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:56,669
What's that noise?

520
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,369
Oh no

521
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:06,569
Good-bye!

522
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:15,769
Damn

523
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:33,969
Haneda Airport
Now the weather information around the airport

524
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:36,445
Firstly
Hokkaidou

525
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,345
Hakodate is raining tonight

526
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,445
And thunder storm in some regions

527
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,369
Thunder storm in Kakodate

528
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:46,369
Terrible weather

529
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:49,169
What if the plane catches a lightning strike?

530
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,469
Don't worry, planes flies over the clouds

531
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:56,069
But under the clouds when landing

532
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:01,869
Today I put make-up so specially, but it rains

533
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,045
My grandma told me wearing this kind of clothes

534
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,469
bellybutton will get stolen
by the god of thunder when it's lightening

535
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,169
Hem, really?

536
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,669
Come on and steal

537
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,569
I'm very sorry

538
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:21,669
We're invited to the celebration party as well

539
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,969
Because of everyone, the sapphire is safe now

540
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,669
This is natural

541
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:27,969
Yes, it is

542
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,269
Please come with us to Hakodate and have fun

543
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,369
But Jyuri hasn't come yet

544
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,069
Yeah

545
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:37,269
Excuse me

546
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:40,169
Ms. Natuki is helping her with her make-up

547
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,269
They are in the car in the parking lot

548
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:43,769
Making up

549
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,745
It's hard to be a super star

550
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,069
Natuki is hard working

551
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:51,969
Yeah, Jyuri regards her highly

552
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,269
Have her do the sundries also as an assistant

553
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:56,369
Ah

554
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:57,669
I see

555
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,269
Hi~

556
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:02,069
I kept you waiting for long

557
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,969
You are very beautiful today

558
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:07,769
Thank you, Mouri

559
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:09,869
It seems everyone's here

560
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:12,069
Not yet, Shinjyou's not here

561
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:15,469
Shinjyou's not feeling very well

562
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:17,969
He called this morning saying that
he can't be here

563
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,469
Aha, I see

564
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,445
What a pity, Jyuri

565
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,369
What?

566
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:24,769
Nothing

567
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:31,669
Will other stagers come?

568
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:33,969
Of course not

569
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,169
Those minor roles don't mean anything here

570
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,869
I just felt...

571
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:04,569
Hakodate, Oonuma lakeside

572
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:08,369
Jyuri's cottage

573
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:18,969
If I felt it right, that guy will be here

574
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,469
Officer Nakamori, everyone's here

575
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,369
Very good

576
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,369
Team A guard the front door

577
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:27,369
Team B guard the back door

578
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:29,269
Team C patrol around

579
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:29,969
Yes, sir

580
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:33,769
Officer Nakamori

581
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:34,469
What?

582
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:36,269
There's light in the cottage

583
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:37,269
What

584
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,369
That is...

585
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,969
Sky Japan Airline, flight to Hakodate

586
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:10,069
Flight Number 865 leaves at 18:15

587
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:14,169
Now start to check in

588
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:19,169
Passengers who take flight #865

589
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,269
So great, the chair is so soft

590
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:34,669
Not bad

591
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:36,569
Like big boss

592
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:39,769
On the second floor there are first-classes
on the demostic flight

593
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:42,269
Only in this Sky Japan Airline

594
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,145
Hey, Ran

595
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:01,669
Ah

596
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:03,345
What is it with you?

597
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,545
Why keep looking back?

598
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,745
Nothing

599
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:08,845
Welcome on board

600
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:09,569
Hello

601
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:11,369
coming

602
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,945
Who?

603
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:14,369
Sh, don't talk

604
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:17,869
Excuse me, is the seat beside you free?

605
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:19,569
Please sit down

606
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:21,669
Eiri

607
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:23,369
It's you?

608
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:24,469
Auntie?

609
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,169
Strange, Mama wants to go to Hakodate too?

610
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,945
What a coincident

611
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,745
What a coincident for you two

612
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,069
What are you talking about?

613
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,345
You said Jyuri invited you to Hakodate

614
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,569
But your father's occupied,
wanted me to go with you

615
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,269
Ran, was it you again?

616
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:46,945
Don't mind, you two sit down first

617
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:50,569
Joke, I won't sit beside her(him)

618
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:51,669
Hem

619
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,069
Don't be like this you two

620
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,269
Father

621
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,245
Jyuri, May I sit beside you?

622
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:00,769
Ah

623
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,269
OK, please

624
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,469
Sigh

625
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:06,069
Wait, mother

626
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:10,745
Excuse me, Are you Ms. Maki Jyuri?

627
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:11,269
Yes

628
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,069
My name's Kisaki Eiri

629
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:17,669
Thank you very much for the treat this time

630
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:18,369
Ah

631
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:19,269
You are welcome

632
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,769
Go go go

633
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:25,445
Ah

634
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:26,469
Oh yeah

635
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:30,669
If the ungraceful man beside you harasses you

636
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,869
I can help any time

637
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,269
Aha, you are a lawyer

638
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,369
Talk to you later

639
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:39,069
OK

640
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:40,369
Hem

641
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:52,069
How could it be like this?

642
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:53,469
Naturally

643
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:54,569
No wonder

644
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,669
Hello everyone, kept you waiting for long

645
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:01,969
Shinjyou

646
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:05,869
Aren't you feel bad and can't come?

647
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:08,869
Yeah, I feel better again

648
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,469
I have nothing to do alone

649
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,769
So I decided to go with everyone still

650
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:19,269
Queen Josephine, sorry that I am late

651
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:22,669
Why didn't you follow my words?

652
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:24,269
Don't worry

653
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,569
No hurry if we prepare when we get there

654
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:30,769
We are setting out

655
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,169
Have a pleasant journey

656
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:37,269
All staff attention please

657
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:40,069
Please close all hatches

658
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,769
What are you thinking about?

659
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:47,569
Ah

660
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:50,369
Probably thinking about Kiddo

661
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,369
Yea

662
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,569
Did he really want to steal the sapphire
last night?

663
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:00,769
It's too dark to play Hide and Seek

664
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,469
Detective brother

665
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,869
And with a overlength baton

666
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:08,869
Kiddo wouldn't have made this kind of mistake

667
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:10,069
Mitsuhiko

668
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:12,645
My seat is 4K

669
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:14,069
Is the K from Kiddo

670
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:16,669
My seat is 4J

671
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,369
Is the J from Giant

672
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:21,069
My seat is 4B

673
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,769
That is

674
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:25,969
I understand now

675
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:29,669
The four words in Kiddo's foretell letter

676
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,769
It refers to these letters

677
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:34,045
These letters?

678
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,569
Exactly

679
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:39,069
To prevent hearing errors
in the radio communication

680
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,369

And also used in radio communication on planes

685
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:52,969
SKJ865

686
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,645
Runway 16L

687
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:56,869
Permit to take off

688
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:00,069
Please go on JULIET10 ECHO10 CHARLIE10

689
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,469
SKJ865

690
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:06,769
JULIET10 ECHO10 CHARLIE10

691
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:10,645
In the 26 sattered flying letters

692
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:15,969
Meaning to foretell there'll be crime
on the plane using these letters

693
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:20,869
And has to be the plane from Tokyo to Hakodate

694
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:21,969
Why?

695
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:23,969
It could also be on the return trip

696
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:26,469
Because of the figure of the poker card?

697
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:27,469
Exactly

698
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:31,369
Spade 2 was torn into two parts

699
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,269
This means odd numbers
which can not be divided by 2

700
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:40,869
The flights from Tokyo are all odd
like this one 865

701
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:43,769
While flights return to Tokyo are all even

702
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,469
This makes sense
for the things happened last night

703
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:50,169
He drew our attention on purpose

704
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,569
Pretends that the plan's failed,
then everyone'll become careless

705
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:57,469
Then...

706
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:00,769
Kiddo is on this plane

707
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,569
Still wants to steal that ring now

708
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:08,345
Thank you for travelling with Sky Japan Airline

709
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:09,569
What's wrong with you?

710
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,669
I don't feel very good

711
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:13,969
You must be very tired

712
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:16,669
Jyuri, give me your hand

713
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:18,069
Take some Vitamin

714
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:22,369
The capitain of this plane is Ohkoshi

715
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:26,969
I'm the Cabin Chief, Jinto

716
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:35,345
SKJ865 permit to take off, wind direction
160 degrees, wind speed 10 nodes

717
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,069
SKJ865 ready to take off

718
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,169
runway 16L

719
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:43,769
Take off!

720
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:53,769
Confirm

721
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:58,669
V1

722
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:00,769

V2

724
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,769
Confirm

725
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:08,769
Wheel up

726
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:09,869
Wheel up

727
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:30,469
My ears are feeling weird

728
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:32,569
Me too

729
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,445
That's because the air pressure changed

730
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:36,469
Try to swallow some slaver

731
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,069
Still the same weird

732
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,769
It's still the same

733
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,169
Then pinch your nose swallow some air

734
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:52,869
But don't do it hard

735
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:54,669
Or you will feel faint

736
00:46:58,469 --> 00:46:59,369
OK

737
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:01,569
Look, snot is out

738
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,469
Conan, look ahead

739
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:08,969
It's ok now

740
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:12,869
Really, it's OK again

741
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:15,869
Girls are like this

742
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:21,769
Pinching nose and swallowing air
don't look so nice

743
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:23,269
So in front of opposite sexes...

744
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:26,869
They especially don't want others to see it

745
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,469
Hm

746
00:47:42,669 --> 00:47:44,169
The lady Jyuri, please do me a favor

747
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,469
Please sign as for commemoration

748
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:48,469
Ah

749
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:49,369
All right

750
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,845
Damn, I forgot my signature pen

751
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:56,769
Maki

752
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:58,869
Please use this pen

753
00:47:58,969 --> 00:47:59,969
Thanks!

754
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,769
So I can't be without her

755
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,769
What is father doing?

756
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:12,769
Don't care about that light-minded man

757
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:16,245
Now let me introduce to you

758
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:16,969
yeah

759
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:30,746
sorry

760
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,945
Are you all right?

761
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:32,669
Yeah

762
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:39,569
Ok, done

763
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:41,169
Thanks!

764
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:52,945
Western or Japanese style dessert,
which one would you prefer?

765
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,269
No, thanks!

766
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,345
Western and Japanese dessert...

767
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,145
Neither

768
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,469
Nor drinks

769
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,069
I'd like to have beer
and some dishes to go with it

770
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:04,969
Just a moment please

771
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:11,569
It's great to have beer in the first class

772
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:36,369
I dislike rain

773
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:37,569
Me too

774
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:39,769
Hope everything will be fine

775
00:49:41,169 --> 00:49:45,445

782
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,945
Captain, are you all right?

783
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:08,869
Yeah

784
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:11,969
My kid had a fever last night, I had little sleep

785
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:14,169
Do you need coffee?

786
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:17,069
Then please make an order for me

787
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:29,245
Is the ring still there?

788
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:32,169
Yes, but we can't get careless

789
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,445
Why so fast out?

790
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:43,569
Wait, Masayo

791
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:45,369
Chocolate

792
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,169
Send stuff to cockpit?

793
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:55,469
Demostic airlines seldom
encountered this kind of occasions

794
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:02,769
I'm Nisawa, coffee is here

795
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:03,769
Come in please

796
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,345
Excuse me

797
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:11,569
Hi

798
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,469
Miss, you're not supposed to be here

799
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,069
Never mind, Nisawa

800
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:19,469
She's your senior sis

801
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:20,169
Ah

802
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:22,645
Captain, long time no see

803
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:23,169
Yeah

804
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:26,145
It's been five years since
I last met you when you resigned

805
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:27,369
7 years

806
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:29,169
Can't imagine already so long time

807
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,269
I haven't seen Nakaya for long time too

808
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:34,045
Hello, I've gone to see Josephine

809
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:34,969
Oh really?

810
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:37,545
Wonderful performance

811
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:40,169
Really? Thanks!

812
00:51:40,669 --> 00:51:42,369
We'll keep supporting you

813
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,169
Captain, meet again some day

814
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:06,169
Maki

815
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:08,545
Please have some chocolate

816
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:09,269
Thanks

817
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:13,969
Do you want one, Mr. Mouri?

818
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:16,169
Oh, yes please

819
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:19,769
Delicious

820
00:52:54,469 --> 00:52:55,169
Why like this?

821
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:59,169
Uncle it smells like almond

822
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:02,769
Should be cyanide

823
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:04,245
It must be the chocolate

824
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:06,069
The chocolate is poisonus

825
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:07,769
Chocolate

826
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:18,669
Don't worry, If the one uncle ate was poisonous,
symptom would show up already

827
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:22,669
But why Ms. Jyuri would get poisoned

828
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,469
The Captain wants to tell everyone

829
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:48,569
In order to prevent chaos, hope we can
cover up the things happend untill landing

830
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:49,769
I understand

831
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:56,069
But how did the criminal put the poison?

832
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:58,569
Must be on the chocolate

833
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,269
Because she died just after she ate the chocolate

834
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:03,469
I think so too

835
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:04,946
Can't be...

836
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,269
Really it's not me

837
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:10,245
I bought the chocolate from the usual shop
in Ginza in the afternoon

838
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:12,069
And it's opened just now

839
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:13,545
Natsuki, you saw it, didn't you?

840
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:14,069
Ah

841
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:17,145
Sorry, I didn't see it clearly

842
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:18,169
Natuski!

843
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:20,245
But you are fine after eating it

844
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:24,269
meaning only part of the chocolate is poisoned

845
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:29,769
But how to make Jyuri choose the poisonous one?

846
00:54:30,169 --> 00:54:35,145
The broker should know which one she eat first

847
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:36,469
Really, it's not me

848
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:39,769
And she follows different orders each time

849
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:44,169
Jyuri hesitated when she chose the chocolate

850
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,469
Shut up! Don't talk kid!

851
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:51,969
Anyway I'll keep this box of chocolate first

852
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:53,069
OK

853
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:57,645
The rest can only be handed over
to the police after landing

854
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,469
Yeah

855
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:03,769
In order to protect the crime scene,
please sit back

856
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:07,169
And the front toilet is also forbidden to use

857
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:25,969
After boarding, except chocolate, Jyuri also ate

858
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:28,869
vitamin

859
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:32,369
But think twice

860
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:35,269
Couldn't make sure that she would eat it

861
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,269
I know it now

862
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,869
I know who the criminal is

863
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:40,846
Father?

864
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,569
Who, Who is the criminal?

865
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:43,769
Listen up

866
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:50,369
Ms. Jyuri ate two things on the plane

867
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:52,469
But which two?

868
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:55,569
One is the chocolate just now

869
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:57,469
The other is the vitamin
Ms. Tenko gave to Ms. Jyuri

870
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,645
Ah

871
00:55:58,669 --> 00:55:59,569
It's you...

872
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:01,969
I guess everybody knows the answer now

873
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:06,969
The criminal who killed Maki Jyuri
on this plane is

874
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,269
Ms. Tenko, it's you!

875
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:19,769
You're kidding, I'm innocent

876
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:22,145
Besides I don't have incentive at all

877
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:23,069
Really?

878
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:28,669
Everyone has the incentive to kill Jyuri

879
00:56:30,269 --> 00:56:32,669
What are you talking about?

880
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:36,269
You are the cosmetician Sakai Natuski, right?

881
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:37,869
What did you mean?

882
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:38,969
Please listen on

883
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:44,069
I had been with Jyuri longer than any one else

884
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:48,069
I know very well about her human relations

885
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:49,769
First Mr. Ban

886
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:53,769
Although he's the nominal director if the drama

887
00:56:54,169 --> 00:56:58,069
Actually Jyuri was in charge in the group

888
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:05,369
He brought up Jyuri all along at first

889
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:09,469
But now he should obey her

890
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:16,369
I've seen several times her wife
Tenko blame Mr. Ban for this thing

891
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:23,469
Narusawa was divorcing with Jyuri three years ago

892
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:25,969
But he still has attaching to Jyuri

893
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,769
He used to request remarry but got rejected

894
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:36,869
Jyuri was tired of her young boyfriend Shinjyou

895
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:40,669
And asked me to introduce her a cute guy

896
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:44,569
Then the broker Masayo

897
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:49,269
Jyuri dislikes her of her dumbness and slowness

898
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:51,969
Always blame her in front of everyone

899
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:57,169
I myself was played by capricious Jyuri

900
00:57:58,069 --> 00:58:01,469
Wanted to change job,
but she kept being in my way

901
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:04,269
It's very pleasant to be in an important position,
also hate her at the same time

902
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:05,569
Isn't it so?

903
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:08,669
So everyone could be the criminal

904
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:15,669
You still have appetite even now, Gentai?

905
00:58:15,969 --> 00:58:18,769
What a waste if I don't eat

906
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:21,969
Delicious

907
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,869
If the poison was on her fingers

908
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:34,469
Shinjou was the first one
had contact with Jyuri's hand

909
00:58:35,569 --> 00:58:37,269
He put the poison at that time?

910
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:39,069
No

911
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:40,269
There are other chances

912
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:44,069
If the pen has poison on it

913
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:48,469
Put the poison when turn on the spot lamp

914
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:50,269
No, there's another possibility

915
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:54,169
Put poison in the toilet on the place
where possible to contact

916
00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:01,569
If so, Jyuri came out very soon
after got into the toilet

917
00:59:03,069 --> 00:59:04,369
Wait, before that...

918
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:09,169
Ah

919
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,469
I know it now

920
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:13,969
I see, so I was...

921
00:59:14,769 --> 00:59:16,269
I don't feel very well

922
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:19,369
I solved the puzzle

923
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:22,269
And I know who the criminal is as well

924
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:32,169
It's weird uncle

925
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,869
Look, what's that?

926
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:35,169
What?

927
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:36,669
There's nothing

928
00:59:37,069 --> 00:59:37,645
Ah

929
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:38,245
What

930
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:39,169
Huh?

931
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:41,269
OK, now

932
00:59:46,569 --> 00:59:47,269
Oh no

933
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:53,169
Hey, what is it on earth?

934
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:56,969
It seems I made a mistake, I go to toilet

935
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,169
What's wrong with the kid?

936
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:03,669
No other choice, although this is the first time

937
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,545
Husband, you don't talk like that

938
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:08,745
What

939
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:10,045
Damn, wrong voice

940
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,845
Sonoko

941
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:11,869
Me?

942
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:16,145
don't keep me guessing, do tell the truth

943
01:00:16,169 --> 01:00:17,169
What

944
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:21,069
This case doesn't need Kogoro

945
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,845
OK, let me tell the truth

946
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:26,069
Really

947
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,569
Great, today auntie will give us
a consequence show

948
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:33,869
Firstly how the criminal poisoned Jyuri

949
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:38,369
I'll start from this surprising way

950
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:40,969
Exactly

951
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:42,269
That is ventilating ears

952
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:44,069
Ventilating ears

953
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:50,469
The criminal knew Jyuri
would ventilate her ear on the plane

954
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:55,769
Using the thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose

955
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,969
This is done normally using the right hand

956
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:01,269
I guess everyone knows this

957
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:04,869
When learning diving,
ventilating ears is the first thing to learn

958
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:09,169
Masters can do that even without pinching nose

959
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:11,745
But Jyuri has just started to learn

960
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:13,769
Still needs to do that quite often

961
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:16,469
Right, husband?

962
01:01:17,169 --> 01:01:18,269
Yes

963
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:21,745
Wait, how did you know about this?

964
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:23,045
Ah

965
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:25,969
When ventilating ears, Ayumi is all the same

966
01:01:26,569 --> 01:01:29,969
Women are too shy to do that in front of men

967
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:34,869
Moreover Jyuri is a super star
and you were aside

968
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:38,045
A loser but does count a man

969
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,469
Me?!

970
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:43,869
So Jyuri went to the toilet to do it

971
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:50,969
Then back to her seat and took the chocolate
with thumb and forefinger of her right hand

972
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:54,769
Customarily lick off the cocoa
remained on the hand

973
01:01:55,969 --> 01:02:03,369
She didn't know this habit
let her take the poison completely

974
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:08,569
What does it mean? Where's the poison?

975
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:15,069
Don't you feel fuggy?

976
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:16,269
Yeah

977
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:17,669
Strange

978
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:25,369
Actually Jyuri was infracted
by the poison already at first

979
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:29,069
Exactly. She felt uncomfortable

980
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,769
was because her skin absorbed poison

981
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:33,069
Skin?

982
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:35,569
That is...

983
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:36,469
Exactly

984
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:40,469
In the car in the parking lot of Haneda airport

985
01:02:41,069 --> 01:02:44,569
Fixed the poison with foundation make-up,
daubed on Jyuri's nose

986
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:48,269
The criminal who killed Mr. Jyuri

987
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:52,569
Sakai Natuski, It's you!

988
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:03,169
How could it be possible?

989
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:05,769
but your consequence sounds very interesting

990
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:08,669
Conan has told me

991
01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:14,169
You have blamed the kids
for playing with your foundation make-up

992
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:18,245
The day when you put the poison

993
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:21,069
The kids were playing with the make-up,
just in case

994
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:24,669
You shouted at them telling them
not to touch it, right?

995
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,869
Do you have concrete evidence?

996
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:30,069
Well...

997
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:33,845
Ms. Jyuri's right hand thumb and forefinger

998
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,669
If there's make-up and poison by testing

999
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:39,169
Considerably it could be the evidence

1000
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:44,069
But Jyuri has licked off all the evidence,
there's nothing left to test

1001
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:47,869
But there's still something else

1002
01:03:49,169 --> 01:03:52,269
The rest of the poisonous make-up

1003
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:56,569
You are so smart that it's impossible for you
to bring it onto the plane

1004
01:03:57,169 --> 01:04:01,169
But it's also too risky to throw it
into the dustbin in the airport

1005
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:04,869
Yes, I'd send it if I were you

1006
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:08,369
Send it back to my home

1007
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:15,669
Contact the post office of the airport,
ask them to check the post, it should work

1008
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:21,469
Can you tell me your home address?

1009
01:04:37,869 --> 01:04:41,269
That woman ruined my dreams

1010
01:04:42,669 --> 01:04:43,369
Dreams?

1011
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:49,869
I hoped to be a cosmetician in Hollywood

1012
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:56,169
In order to realize my dreams,
I went to cosmetic school in LA

1013
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:58,269
I've learned to speak fluent English

1014
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:03,935
When I got back I was
doing make-up for that woman

1015
01:05:03,959 --> 01:05:06,569
while I kept sending job
applications to Hollywood

1016
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:11,769
One month ago, A Hollywood actress came to Japan

1017
01:05:12,669 --> 01:05:18,569
The broker company regarded highly about
my skills and hoped that I could go to Hollywood

1018
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:23,369
It's a unique chance for my entire life

1019
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:24,969
But

1020
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:27,945
But that woman...

1021
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:30,069
That woman ruined the chance behind me

1022
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,569
It seemed that she didn't want you to leave

1023
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:37,669
It would be OK if she only wanted me
to do make-up for her

1024
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,869
But this was not the case

1025
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:46,869
She regarded me as a servitor easy to use

1026
01:05:49,169 --> 01:05:52,769
When I got to know this, I decided to kill her

1027
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:57,869
She destroyed my dignity as a cosmetician

1028
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:03,669
Dignity as a cosmetician?

1029
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:05,769
Don't tell jokes

1030
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:10,669
Then why did you choose cosmetics
as your lethal weapon?

1031
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:16,869
You're not competent to talk about dignity

1032
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:20,869
I...

1033
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:22,969
I...

1034
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:30,769
You are still young,
start over after you repay your sin

1035
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:45,469
Why do I have bad premonition?

1036
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,769
My head hurts

1037
01:06:54,169 --> 01:06:55,069
Oh no

1038
01:06:55,369 --> 01:06:59,369
Tell the captain not to eat the snack
sent in just now

1039
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:03,245
Captain will be in danger if not in time

1040
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,845
Dumb kid

1041
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:06,745
The snack is not poisonus

1042
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:07,845
The point is not the snack

1043
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:10,969
The captain's hand could have touched the poison

1044
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:12,169
What?

1045
01:07:12,569 --> 01:07:14,869
What's going on? tell me

1046
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:16,769
OK, I'm going

1047
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,269
Excuse me

1048
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:24,069
As expected

1049
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:25,569
Captain?

1050
01:07:26,169 --> 01:07:28,045
What's wrong, captain?

1051
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:29,169
Are you all right?

1052
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:30,745
What's going on?

1053
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:33,145
Nakaya, are you all right?

1054
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:33,869
Captain...

1055
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:41,469
Damn, the auto-pilot system's been cancelled

1056
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,345
Cheer up, captain

1057
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:55,046
Captain

1058
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,269
Pull him up now, pull the seat back

1059
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:02,269
Captain

1060
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:21,069
OK, press the auto-pilot button

1061
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:23,945
Shinjyou

1062
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:25,169
Good job, little brother

1063
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,045
It's ok now, send the doctor in fast

1064
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:28,769
OK

1065
01:08:29,869 --> 01:08:32,769
There's a passenger suddenly passed out right now

1066
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:37,869
If anyone in the passenger is a doctor,
please tell the waitress around

1067
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:50,169
As expected it's acute chemical toxicosis

1068
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:51,969
I'll do first aid for them

1069
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:53,769
Please move them to the cabin

1070
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:54,569
Yes

1071
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:57,445
Narusawa, Ban, come and help

1072
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:57,869
Yes

1073
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,269
Bring the first aid kit

1074
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,069
OK

1075
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:05,969
Conan, why is the captain also poisoned?

1076
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:09,269
Jyuri has been in the cockpit just now

1077
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:15,045
Captain and copilot kissed her hand

1078
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:18,769
Aha I see, so they touched the poison on her hand

1079
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:20,969
Very unlucky

1080
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:27,769
If only shaking hands, the poison would only
on their palms, wouldn't be in the mouths at all

1081
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:44,569
Doctor, how is it?

1082
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:49,669
Fortunately only tittle poison,
their lives are not in danger

1083
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:55,269
But they are unconscious now,
can't fly the plane at all

1084
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:04,269
What? Captain and copilot are unconscious?

1085
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,869
Excuse me, May I have your name?

1086
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:10,169
I'm Shinjyou, a passenger

1087
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:14,269
Shinjyou, what is the status of the fly?

1088
01:10:14,769 --> 01:10:16,869
Altitude 12000 feet

1089
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:18,969
Speed 280 nodes

1090
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:22,769
Fortunately the auto-steering system
has also the landing code ready set

1091
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:26,169
I have little experience
on operating flap and undercarriage

1092
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:29,269
Only have to give me timing instructions

1093
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:30,569
I understand

1094
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:33,645
Take off and landing of other planes
are completely stopped

1095
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:36,569
And other captains are called
in to the control tower

1096
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:41,169
Because the weather of Hakodate is not steady

1097
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:46,569
All flights can't take off or land temporarily

1098
01:10:47,169 --> 01:10:48,969
Please be patient and wait

1099
01:10:49,569 --> 01:10:51,269
Ladies and gentlemen...

1100
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:55,069
So the captain seat is for me

1101
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:57,569
Then the copilot seat

1102
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,569
you are in charge of it

1103
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:04,569
Great pilot skills just now

1104
01:11:06,769 --> 01:11:07,669
Awesome

1105
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:11,869
Because I have
played in the amusement park a few times

1106
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:13,669
Hey...

1107
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,945
Conan, you are rascally

1108
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:17,545
I want to sit too

1109
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:18,845
And me too

1110
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:20,269
This is not playing!

1111
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:24,569
And now it doesn't need steering

1112
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:29,969
But auto-pilot needs some steering when landing??

1113
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,845
So I need his assistance

1114
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:35,069
Anyways you don't need a kid

1115
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:37,269
Anyway I will take care of it here

1116
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:39,969
It's going to land in 15 minutes

1117
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:42,169
Please go back to your cabin and have your seats

1118
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:51,145
Shinjyou said he's got pilot experience

1119
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:53,569
Does he have small aeroplane license?

1120
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:54,969
Strange

1121
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:58,169
Father, mother seems asleep

1122
01:11:59,469 --> 01:12:00,469
What?

1123
01:12:03,269 --> 01:12:07,269
Please go back to your seats
and put on your life belts

1124
01:12:09,369 --> 01:12:12,069
Father, sit beside mother

1125
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,969
Sigh, can't do anything about her

1126
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:22,769
Hey, wake up

1127
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:24,469
Hey

1128
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:26,569
Sigh

1129
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,269
You are Kiddo, right?

1130
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:43,245
I don't know what you're talking about

1131
01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:45,269
Don't play dummy

1132
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:50,369
Who will let a schoolboy pilot the plane

1133
01:12:50,669 --> 01:12:52,269
Hehe, finally you noticed

1134
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,345
About the real Shinjyou...

1135
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:59,069
He disguised as you
and now he's in Hakodate cottage

1136
01:12:59,369 --> 01:12:59,869
Isn't it?

1137
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:05,169
Seeing you boarding, Jyuri was very angery

1138
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:09,569
Probably for this carabet,
Jyuri asked Shinjyou to disguise as you

1139
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,069
Creditably well-known detective, but...

1140
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:17,569
Someone thinks that Kiddo won't stop
like this and he's already in Hakodate

1141
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:21,669
Maybe now he's still chasing the fake Kiddo

1142
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:44,269
When do you plan to steal the sapphire of fate?

1143
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:46,145
I don't need it any more

1144
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:46,669
Ah

1145
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:49,269
You should have known it also

1146
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:52,869
The real Sapphire tastes freezing

1147
01:13:53,769 --> 01:13:54,969
That one was fake

1148
01:13:57,069 --> 01:13:59,669
So you did that to know if it's fake

1149
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:05,769
It was for drawing the spectators attention
to the drama

1150
01:14:06,169 --> 01:14:09,669
So fake gem was used to imitate the real one

1151
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:11,269
So

1152
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:14,169
Do you still want to prison me?
Detective brother

1153
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:18,869
Of course,
as soon as this big bird goes back to nest

1154
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,069
Flight SKJ865

1155
01:14:22,669 --> 01:14:24,569
Hand over to Hakodate control in a second

1156
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:28,169
Please change the frequency to 118.35

1157
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:30,969
118.35 roger that

1158
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,169
This is Hakodate control

1159
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:36,969
This is Control Chief Uesugi

1160
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:39,469
Now please let captain Shimaoka on the radio

1161
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:41,169
This is Shimaoka

1162
01:14:41,569 --> 01:14:45,545
Can you see MCP - Module Control Panel?

1163
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:47,069
Yes, I see

1164
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:50,569
Please press the APP button on it

1165
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:54,569
Thus the plane will automatically
land on the runway

1166
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:55,569
Roger

1167
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:57,469
APP...

1168
01:14:57,769 --> 01:14:58,345
It's there

1169
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:58,769
Ah

1170
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:01,069
It's pressed

1171
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:02,969
Who are you?

1172
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:04,845
This is Edogawa Conan

1173
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:06,169
I am Shinjyou's assistant

1174
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:07,646
Assistant?

1175
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,369
There's a kid around?

1176
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:10,569
Little boy

1177
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,669
Don't touch the joy stick and other buttons

1178
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:14,469
Do you understand?

1179
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:15,169
Yeah

1180
01:15:16,269 --> 01:15:17,769
His heart is at rest for now

1181
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:20,769
You know how to steer the flaps
and the undercarriage?

1182
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:22,169
I do

1183
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:26,745
My father taught me how to do it
on the small plane in Hawaii

1184
01:15:26,769 --> 01:15:30,269
Reall, I certainly didn't pick the wrong guy

1185
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:33,169
But that's about the theory

1186
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:36,269
I've never piloted a real plane

1187
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:43,745
Terrible weather,
but it should be possible to land

1188
01:15:43,769 --> 01:15:44,569
Yeah

1189
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:04,545
Heavy rain

1190
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:05,869
The wind is hard too

1191
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:08,769
The plane won't crash, right?

1192
01:16:21,069 --> 01:16:22,469
There's the airport

1193
01:16:27,269 --> 01:16:28,445
It's coming

1194
01:16:28,469 --> 01:16:31,069
Flight 865, please set the flaps to 1

1195
01:16:35,769 --> 01:16:36,869
Set the flaps to 5

1196
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:40,469
Set the flaps to 10

1197
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:45,269
Wheel down, set the flaps to 20

1198
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,969
It's going to land

1199
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:18,869
What's going on?

1200
01:17:19,269 --> 01:17:21,569
It's lightening,
the plane's been hit by lightening

1201
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:23,669
This is flight 865

1202
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:26,669
After the lightening just now
everything's disappeared

1203
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:30,569
Calm down,
turn the white button beside the dash board

1204
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:34,945
The lights are on

1205
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:35,569
Not all of them

1206
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,169
The auto-pilot light is not on

1207
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:41,269
What did you say?

1208
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:45,469
Stop landing,
pull up the steer stick as much as you can

1209
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,369
Good, wheel up

1210
01:17:57,869 --> 01:17:58,446
It's done

1211
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,869
Good, keep climbing

1212
01:18:02,569 --> 01:18:04,569
Damn, the wind blew it away

1213
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:07,069
Turn right, turn right now

1214
01:18:10,469 --> 01:18:13,045
It'll crash onto the airport lounge

1215
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:14,269
Pull up now

1216
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,269
Oh no

1217
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:51,869
No, oh no

1218
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:53,869
What a view

1219
01:18:57,769 --> 01:19:00,469
Any problems with the fire in the airport?

1220
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,969
Flight 865, do you read?

1221
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:04,669
Loud and clear

1222
01:19:05,169 --> 01:19:06,069
How about the damage status?

1223
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:08,545
Zero casualty in the control tower

1224
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,445
But I'm afraid the runway
can't be in use right away

1225
01:19:10,469 --> 01:19:11,469
How about you there?

1226
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:13,669
Engine 2 detached

1227
01:19:14,269 --> 01:19:17,945
It's OK, it's possible to land
with only 4 engines

1228
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,469
But you have to take care of the balance

1229
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:21,345
The plane's currently in balance

1230
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:24,145
I've set the rudder to the 3rd throttle

1231
01:19:24,169 --> 01:19:26,469
Very good,
how about the current altitude and speed?

1232
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:28,869
3000 feet, 200 nodes

1233
01:19:29,469 --> 01:19:32,269
Flaps set to 5, fly horizontally

1234
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:41,645
Head to 180 degrees, climb to 4500 feet

1235
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:42,069
Roger

1236
01:19:43,169 --> 01:19:45,169
Then hover waiting to land?

1237
01:19:45,469 --> 01:19:45,869
Maybe

1238
01:19:46,269 --> 01:19:50,069
If the auto-pilot machine
can be recovered and runway cleared

1239
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:53,469
we can do the auto-landing again

1240
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:57,569
Didn't I say the fire engines were not enough?

1241
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,369
Put out the fire on the runway, fast!

1242
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:11,545
Conan, it's too bad

1243
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:12,569
It's too bad

1244
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:14,945
One engine detached

1245
01:20:14,969 --> 01:20:16,669
I knew, don't worry

1246
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:20,369
It will do with 3 engines

1247
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:22,369
And the fuel is quite enough...

1248
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:23,969
What?

1249
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,045
Almost empty

1250
01:20:26,069 --> 01:20:26,569
What?

1251
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:30,469
Fuel out?

1252
01:20:30,969 --> 01:20:32,245
Fuel out?

1253
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:33,869
What's going on?

1254
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:36,569
Because the engine detached?

1255
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:42,069
The fuel to each engine is provided individually

1256
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:44,269
The fuel valve is on?

1257
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:48,545
Hey, what valve?

1258
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:49,869
It's the fuel valve

1259
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:55,369
Press that button,
the valve for saparating the fuel tanks will open

1260
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:57,269
And turning into a whole fuel tank

1261
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:59,569
Damn, why like this?

1262
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:03,169
Ah

1263
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:07,069
It's all because of that damned old fellow

1264
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:09,369
It seems not much time left

1265
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:10,469
Yeah

1266
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:12,145
There's a map,
Can anyone help me bring it here?

1267
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:15,169
This is flight 865, there's an emmergency

1268
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:17,369
Do you read, control tower? Please respond

1269
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:21,769
Flight 865, This is control,
I don't hear it clearly, please speak louder

1270
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:24,869
hey, too much statics, I can't hear it clearly

1271
01:21:25,169 --> 01:21:26,545
What's going on?

1272
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:27,369
Doctor...

1273
01:21:27,669 --> 01:21:30,969
One engine detached, the fuel's almost out

1274
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:32,169
What did you say?

1275
01:21:32,869 --> 01:21:34,645
Map map...

1276
01:21:34,669 --> 01:21:36,145
Should be the red one

1277
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:37,645
Found it

1278
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:38,269
Damn

1279
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:41,045
Auto-pilot system, runway, fuel

1280
01:21:41,069 --> 01:21:43,269
Now even the radio is not working

1281
01:21:44,069 --> 01:21:45,245
Even the auto-piloting is broken?

1282
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:47,669
So now it's manual piloting?

1283
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:50,745
Conan, map's here

1284
01:21:50,769 --> 01:21:51,669
Thank you

1285
01:21:52,069 --> 01:21:54,169
The fuel left is about 3000 pounds

1286
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:58,269
300 pounds per minute, so only 10 minutes left

1287
01:21:59,069 --> 01:22:01,869
We have to find a place to land within 10 minutes

1288
01:22:02,169 --> 01:22:03,669
Find a place to land?

1289
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:07,269
The runway is not going to be in use
within 10 minutes

1290
01:22:08,469 --> 01:22:10,869
What if go to Shinchidose airport?

1291
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:14,869
It's too risky, we'll run out of fuel on the way

1292
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:18,445
How about other airports?
Is there any other airport near by?

1293
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:19,069
No

1294
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,269
Or maybe the airport in farms or militia base?

1295
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:26,969
The runways are not long enough

1296
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:28,369
Ah

1297
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:32,269
What if we occasionally land on the road?

1298
01:22:32,769 --> 01:22:35,645
There are many straight roads in Hakodate, right?

1299
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:36,169
No

1300
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:40,269
The width between the wheels
of the plane is 11 meters

1301
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:46,469
Roads wider than 12 should have saparating
lsland and nameplate in the middle

1302
01:22:47,169 --> 01:22:49,269
And there're civilian buildings
and lamp posts around

1303
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:50,845
Then how about farms?

1304
01:22:50,869 --> 01:22:51,569
No

1305
01:22:52,669 --> 01:22:54,645
The ground is too soft

1306
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:57,269
Then land on the sea surface near by

1307
01:22:57,569 --> 01:23:01,069
No, the tide will overturn the plane

1308
01:23:05,269 --> 01:23:06,769
Where? where?

1309
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:10,569
There must be a place we can land on

1310
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:14,069
Long and straight, and nothing around

1311
01:23:17,969 --> 01:23:21,669
What if we can't land?

1312
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:25,369
Then the plane will crash

1313
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:28,245
I don't want to die

1314
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,369
Conan, I know where

1315
01:23:31,169 --> 01:23:33,969
Long and straight, and nothing around

1316
01:23:34,269 --> 01:23:34,669
Ah

1317
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:40,169
It was in the dolphin TV program last time

1318
01:23:41,269 --> 01:23:43,969
Can't help thinking about Muroran
when talking about dolphins

1319
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:47,269
The pier

1320
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:52,545
Shinnittetsu Pier

1321
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,145
Nakauhe Pier

1322
01:23:54,169 --> 01:23:55,445
West Motowa Pier

1323
01:23:55,469 --> 01:23:56,469
Muroran Pier

1324
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:58,169
Nisseki Pier...

1325
01:23:58,969 --> 01:23:59,469
Found it!

1326
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:00,769
Sakimori Pier

1327
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:08,345
About 1400 meters in length, 30 meters in width

1328
01:24:08,369 --> 01:24:10,245
How about the width of this plane?

1329
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:10,769
Ah

1330
01:24:11,169 --> 01:24:12,769
60 meters

1331
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:16,445
Let the other wing stretch to the sea?...

1332
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:18,669
Impossible, not long enough

1333
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:23,369
This kind of plane slides
over 2000 meters when landing

1334
01:24:24,169 --> 01:24:26,669
And there's some problem
with the strength of the ground

1335
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:28,346
Don't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate

1336
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:31,069
The fuel is almost out,
and not so many passengers

1337
01:24:31,769 --> 01:24:35,269
The lighter, the shorter the plane slides

1338
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:38,345
If the wind blows in the right direction,
it can be even shortened

1339
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:38,969
Ah

1340
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:41,545
I saw the weather forecast in the airport

1341
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:44,269
It'll be west wind all night

1342
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:45,545
Mitsuhiko, is it so?

1343
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:45,969
Yes

1344
01:24:46,369 --> 01:24:49,069
This pier is transmeridional(east-west)

1345
01:24:49,869 --> 01:24:53,869
If we face the west wind, land from the east end,
maybe we can land successfully

1346
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:54,669
No

1347
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:59,469
I injured my left hand
when crashed onto the control tower

1348
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:02,569
I'm now piloting only by my right hand

1349
01:25:04,169 --> 01:25:06,169
If I manually land

1350
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:09,069
I have to use both hand to hold the steer stick

1351
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:15,369
How is your eyesight?

1352
01:25:16,669 --> 01:25:18,369
1.5 both

1353
01:25:19,169 --> 01:25:19,769
Any disease?

1354
01:25:20,669 --> 01:25:21,669
No

1355
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:23,869
how about BWH?

1356
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,869
My breast is...

1357
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:28,845
Why?

1358
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:30,469
Good, you are qualified

1359
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:33,169
You sit here instead of me

1360
01:25:33,769 --> 01:25:37,045
What are you saying?
Want me to pilot the plane?

1361
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:40,169
Don't worry, I will guide you behind you

1362
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,369
You only have to hold the steer stick firmly

1363
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:45,869
No, I can't do it

1364
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:53,245
The plane... the plane's going down

1365
01:25:53,269 --> 01:25:54,745
It's going down

1366
01:25:54,769 --> 01:25:56,369
Ms. Ran, sit down now

1367
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:04,469
Then pull up the steer stick slowly

1368
01:26:05,169 --> 01:26:06,169
Calm down

1369
01:26:12,969 --> 01:26:14,069
Good, very good

1370
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,445
It's easy, isn't it?

1371
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:16,669
Sounds so easy

1372
01:26:17,569 --> 01:26:18,569
What is the direction of Muroran?

1373
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:19,969
I am looking

1374
01:26:21,369 --> 01:26:22,069
I found it

1375
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:25,045
Airline Hakodate-Sapporo

1376
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:26,569
It's via around Muroran

1377
01:26:27,969 --> 01:26:29,369
The direction is 023 degrees

1378
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:31,169
023, right?

1379
01:26:37,769 --> 01:26:40,445
Go over the mountain,
altitude must be greater than 5000 feet

1380
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:40,969
Got it

1381
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:42,569
Please

1382
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:45,745
Please tell the passengers
we are heading to Titose

1383
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:46,469
OK

1384
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,669
By the way please tell the 2nd floor
passenger to go to 1st floor

1385
01:26:50,969 --> 01:26:54,969
If they knew it's a senior high school
school piloting, it would be a big chaos

1386
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,769
You guys go back to your seats as well

1387
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:03,369
You can't help at here

1388
01:27:03,869 --> 01:27:08,769
And I need you to conciliate other kids

1389
01:27:10,369 --> 01:27:14,369
This is very important, I'll ask
someone else if you don't want to do it

1390
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:16,669
OK, can you do it?

1391
01:27:17,169 --> 01:27:17,969
I got it

1392
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:19,146
We'll do our best

1393
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,445
We'll take care of it

1394
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:22,269
OK, then it's all up to you

1395
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:23,369
Yes

1396
01:27:26,269 --> 01:27:27,645
I want to stay here

1397
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:30,869
If there's an emmergency, only I can help Ran

1398
01:27:36,769 --> 01:27:37,869
All right then

1399
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:41,569
I'll explain the rest devices later on

1400
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:42,869
There's not much time

1401
01:27:43,869 --> 01:27:44,169
Go

1402
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:53,769
Flight SKJ865

1403
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:55,469
This is Hakodate Control

1404
01:27:55,769 --> 01:27:58,269
Do you read? please respond

1405
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:02,169
Sigh, even the spare communication
is not responding

1406
01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:04,069
Look

1407
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:06,669
Flight 865 is flying away

1408
01:28:07,869 --> 01:28:09,469
Where is it heading to?

1409
01:28:21,469 --> 01:28:23,469
There's the Bridge Shiratori

1410
01:28:24,169 --> 01:28:26,969
Right, Shiratori

1411
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:30,869
Officer, it should be Bridge Hakutyou

1412
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:36,269
You seggusted me to visit Muroran
on the way back from Sapporo, it's really nice

1413
01:28:36,669 --> 01:28:39,569
The bridge Shiratori is really beautiful

1414
01:28:41,969 --> 01:28:44,569
I wish one day I can come with Minako

1415
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:48,869
Hehe, I won't choose to come here for sure

1416
01:28:51,569 --> 01:28:52,269
Huh?

1417
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:58,269
Why so many police wagons?

1418
01:28:58,969 --> 01:29:01,169
Probably chasing a vicious criminal

1419
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:03,569
OK, we go there and take a look

1420
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:09,645
Dear passengers

1421
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:10,046
I am so scared, mom

1422
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:12,245
The plane has encountered a little accident

1423
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:12,946
Is it serious?

1424
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:18,669
We are currently heading
to spare airport - Titose airport

1425
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:21,345
Actually we are going to Muroran, right?

1426
01:29:21,369 --> 01:29:22,469
Sh~

1427
01:29:28,069 --> 01:29:29,069
We are almost in Muroran

1428
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:32,145
Set the altitude down to 2000 feet

1429
01:29:32,169 --> 01:29:32,569
Got it

1430
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:43,769
I see it, lamplight

1431
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:47,369
That is Muroran port,
Sakimori pier is on the near left

1432
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:49,369
At the other end of the bridge Hakutyou

1433
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:51,969
Damn

1434
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:54,669
Look

1435
01:29:55,469 --> 01:29:57,069
It's too dark ahead to see anything

1436
01:29:57,569 --> 01:30:00,369
We are going to land on this kind of place?

1437
01:30:01,169 --> 01:30:03,769
So? We can't turn back any more

1438
01:30:04,769 --> 01:30:07,069
Conan, will it work?

1439
01:30:14,269 --> 01:30:14,869
What're you gonna do?

1440
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:18,069
It seems bad, I take my leave first

1441
01:30:18,569 --> 01:30:19,269
Good luck

1442
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:20,945
Wait

1443
01:30:20,969 --> 01:30:21,969
Hey, wait

1444
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:26,669
Ran, drop the prow a bit

1445
01:30:37,569 --> 01:30:38,969
Wait, what do you wanna do?

1446
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:40,969
Hold on

1447
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:47,469
What? What happened?

1448
01:30:47,769 --> 01:30:49,369
It's ok, don't worry

1449
01:30:49,869 --> 01:30:51,469
Keep the plane steady

1450
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:02,769
Kai~ Kaitou Kiddo

1451
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:06,769
Lady, we'll meet again

1452
01:31:07,369 --> 01:31:10,369
Hope we can meet again
under the beautiful moonlight

1453
01:31:11,469 --> 01:31:11,969
OK

1454
01:31:12,469 --> 01:31:13,169
Excuse me

1455
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:15,869
Ah

1456
01:31:25,769 --> 01:31:26,369
He jumped?

1457
01:31:26,769 --> 01:31:29,169
Yea, Shinjyou is Kiddo

1458
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:32,645
That's why he pushed the botton
to reduce the air pressure in the cabin

1459
01:31:32,669 --> 01:31:35,645
He's afraid to crash, so fled first

1460
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:37,269
What a shame, I had respected him so much

1461
01:31:37,769 --> 01:31:41,545
Sonoko, it's not bound to crash

1462
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:42,569
But Conan...

1463
01:31:44,269 --> 01:31:45,369
What should we do next?

1464
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:50,269
Now we can only rely on ourselves to land, Ran

1465
01:31:52,269 --> 01:31:53,669
Don't worry, Ran

1466
01:31:54,469 --> 01:31:57,645
The three musketeers are equal to a Napolean

1467
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:58,969
We will be OK

1468
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:01,369
For christ's sake, it's no Napolean

1469
01:32:03,369 --> 01:32:05,945
It should be Napoleon

1470
01:32:05,969 --> 01:32:06,869
Was I wrong?

1471
01:32:10,669 --> 01:32:14,069
Anyway we hover over the pier
and see how it will be

1472
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:21,569
Help

1473
01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:23,869
Help me

1474
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:27,945
I am not Kiddo,
you must've mistaken me as someone else

1475
01:32:27,969 --> 01:32:29,769
Then why did you run away?

1476
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:33,169
Because I stole the clock

1477
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:35,869
I knew it, you are Kiddo

1478
01:32:36,169 --> 01:32:37,169
Officer Nakamori

1479
01:32:37,669 --> 01:32:38,169
What?

1480
01:32:38,569 --> 01:32:39,769
What is that?

1481
01:32:40,169 --> 01:32:41,069
Hm

1482
01:32:43,069 --> 01:32:45,769
It's obviously Kiddo

1483
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:48,669
Kiddo?

1484
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:54,245
Then who are you?

1485
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:56,169
I've said you recognized the wrong guy

1486
01:32:59,369 --> 01:33:01,069
Sonoko, how is it?

1487
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,045
No way

1488
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:05,145
Only some places have lamplight

1489
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:07,345
But almost completely dark,
I can't see it clearly at all

1490
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:08,069
Damn

1491
01:33:10,869 --> 01:33:12,269
Ran, are you all right?

1492
01:33:13,769 --> 01:33:14,869
Ran, what's wrong with you?

1493
01:33:15,769 --> 01:33:18,669
I don't now, my body starts to shiver

1494
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:23,369
Conan, I still can't do it

1495
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:26,369
No, you'll make it

1496
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:29,969
Damn, it's too dangerous if it's still like this

1497
01:33:31,269 --> 01:33:33,545
Sonoko, let's make a change

1498
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:34,769
I go to the toilet

1499
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:35,969
Toilet?

1500
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:37,445
I'll be right back

1501
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:41,469
The radio's going to be back online soon,
you'd better put on the earphones

1502
01:33:41,769 --> 01:33:42,969
Wait...

1503
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:44,669
Ah

1504
01:33:45,069 --> 01:33:47,869
Give me a break,
go to the toilet when it's so urgent

1505
01:33:48,469 --> 01:33:50,169
That's why I don't like little boys

1506
01:33:52,769 --> 01:33:54,669
Hello hello

1507
01:33:55,169 --> 01:33:55,769
Ran

1508
01:33:56,369 --> 01:33:57,569
Ran, can you hear it?

1509
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:01,369
Shinichi?

1510
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:04,769
I am calling from Sapporo control tower

1511
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:08,069
It seems that you are in a dangerous situation

1512
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:11,469
But everything will be ok

1513
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:15,669
Calm down and do as I tell,
then you'll land safely

1514
01:34:17,169 --> 01:34:19,869
I will protect you, don't worry

1515
01:34:21,769 --> 01:34:22,769
Ran, do you hear me?

1516
01:34:24,969 --> 01:34:26,369
Ran, answer him

1517
01:34:28,169 --> 01:34:28,769
Nonsense

1518
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:31,069
Only tell me this kind of good words

1519
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:33,269
Do you know?

1520
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:36,845
All passenger's lives are in my hand

1521
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:38,969
Don't talk so easy for christ's sake

1522
01:34:40,469 --> 01:34:43,769
You are never around when it's urgent,
only give me a call

1523
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:48,369
Sometimes you were back,
you disappeared right away

1524
01:34:53,069 --> 01:34:53,769
Every time...

1525
01:34:56,969 --> 01:34:57,769
Every time...

1526
01:35:02,569 --> 01:35:04,245
I've had enough, I don't want to listen on

1527
01:35:04,269 --> 01:35:06,445
Shinichi brother said this

1528
01:35:06,469 --> 01:35:07,469
Ran, wait for me

1529
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:09,646
Don't ever think about escape

1530
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:10,969
I will be right back

1531
01:35:12,069 --> 01:35:13,669
Always leave me alone

1532
01:35:14,569 --> 01:35:17,269
He said he hoped you can wait for him

1533
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:20,169
Who do you think I am?

1534
01:35:28,469 --> 01:35:29,169
I...

1535
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:41,869
I love you, Shinichi

1536
01:35:48,269 --> 01:35:48,669
Ran...

1537
01:35:49,469 --> 01:35:51,869
There's lamplight, I see lamplight!

1538
01:35:52,769 --> 01:35:54,869
Red lamplight flowing like a belt

1539
01:35:55,169 --> 01:35:55,969
What?

1540
01:36:02,269 --> 01:36:03,569
Aha, I see

1541
01:36:10,969 --> 01:36:13,869
Damn, damned Kidd, don't ever think about escape

1542
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:18,645
Hey, Kiddo is heading to the pier

1543
01:36:18,669 --> 01:36:19,945
I got it

1544
01:36:19,969 --> 01:36:21,545
Kiddo is heading to the pier

1545
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:23,945
Team A and B go around
to the other side to surround him

1546
01:36:23,969 --> 01:36:26,345
Occupy the sides of the pier with police cars

1547
01:36:26,369 --> 01:36:28,569
Team C follow me

1548
01:36:29,069 --> 01:36:30,669
I'll catch Kiddo

1549
01:36:37,269 --> 01:36:39,145
Grandpa, there're so many police cars

1550
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:40,669
What happened?

1551
01:36:41,269 --> 01:36:43,069
It seems they are heading this way

1552
01:36:54,869 --> 01:36:57,169
Ran, prepare for landing

1553
01:36:58,269 --> 01:37:01,569
Those lamplight should be
the police cars allured by Kiddo

1554
01:37:01,869 --> 01:37:04,245
So Kiddo jumped off to...

1555
01:37:04,269 --> 01:37:07,069
Use the light from the police cars to be a runway

1556
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:09,945
Creditably my saint Kiddo

1557
01:37:09,969 --> 01:37:11,769
I knew it that he is a good guy

1558
01:37:13,269 --> 01:37:15,969
Ran, turn left again

1559
01:37:16,669 --> 01:37:17,269
Got it

1560
01:37:35,269 --> 01:37:37,169
Find out Kiddo now!

1561
01:37:37,469 --> 01:37:40,169
He must be around, find him!

1562
01:37:44,169 --> 01:37:44,945
Hey, have you find him?

1563
01:37:44,969 --> 01:37:45,945
No

1564
01:37:45,969 --> 01:37:46,969
How about there?

1565
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:51,269
It's up to you, well-known detective

1566
01:37:53,069 --> 01:37:56,769
Dear passengers,
our plane will make a emmergency landing

1567
01:37:57,369 --> 01:38:00,969
Please put on your safety belts
and follow the staff's instructions

1568
01:38:01,769 --> 01:38:05,645
Please put aside your pens and glasses and put your
high heeled shoes in the bag under the seats

1569
01:38:05,669 --> 01:38:08,969
Bow yourselves
and put your heads between your legs

1570
01:38:11,769 --> 01:38:14,269
Ran, listen up, we are going to land

1571
01:38:14,869 --> 01:38:16,369
How about the current altitude and speed?

1572
01:38:16,869 --> 01:38:20,169
Altitude 700 feet, speed 140 nodes

1573
01:38:20,669 --> 01:38:23,769
Very good, keep the decline rate at 3

1574
01:38:24,069 --> 01:38:24,969
Sonoko

1575
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:27,669
Release the undercarriage and flaps

1576
01:38:27,969 --> 01:38:30,669
undercarriage? flaps?

1577
01:38:30,969 --> 01:38:31,969
Undercarriage lever is that one

1578
01:38:32,269 --> 01:38:33,269
Flap lever is this one

1579
01:38:33,569 --> 01:38:34,346
Got it

1580
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,369
Pull down the undercarriage lever

1581
01:38:36,769 --> 01:38:38,269
Pull up the flap lever

1582
01:38:39,769 --> 01:38:41,645
Ah, What happened?

1583
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:42,369
What's wrong?

1584
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:45,669
Shinichi, the fuel's running out

1585
01:38:46,369 --> 01:38:47,069
Got it

1586
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:50,169
There isn't a second chance, we have to make it

1587
01:39:06,769 --> 01:39:08,245
Officer Megure

1588
01:39:08,269 --> 01:39:08,869
Hm?

1589
01:39:09,269 --> 01:39:11,445
That plane...

1590
01:39:11,469 --> 01:39:13,069
Seems it's coming this way

1591
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:15,569
Why?

1592
01:39:16,969 --> 01:39:19,569
Pull up prow, pull the power lever to the end

1593
01:39:27,569 --> 01:39:29,569
Everybody take cover!

1594
01:39:33,769 --> 01:39:34,669
Prow down

1595
01:39:37,869 --> 01:39:38,969
Eject in converse direction

1596
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:55,069
Stop stop stop

1597
01:39:59,269 --> 01:40:00,845
Shinichi, there's a crane in the front

1598
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,345
We are crashing

1599
01:40:02,369 --> 01:40:02,769
Damn

1600
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:05,569
Take the rudder, right foot step onto the pedal

1601
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:30,669
Stopped

1602
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:32,145
The plane's stopped

1603
01:40:32,169 --> 01:40:33,569
Great

1604
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:47,069
Kuto, it seems there's no such word
as impossible in your dictionary

1605
01:40:48,169 --> 01:40:49,769
Awesome, Ran

1606
01:40:53,069 --> 01:40:53,969
Ran?

1607
01:40:55,069 --> 01:40:57,869
Ran, cheer up

1608
01:40:59,569 --> 01:41:00,369
Sonoko?

1609
01:41:03,569 --> 01:41:05,669
Aha, just passed out

1610
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:07,869
no wonder

1611
01:41:08,469 --> 01:41:10,269
It was really hard for you this time

1612
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:15,769
Good job, Ran

1613
01:45:49,269 --> 01:45:52,169
Blood pressure and pulse are very normal

1614
01:45:52,969 --> 01:45:54,569
It should be no problem

1615
01:45:54,969 --> 01:45:56,669
But anyway we send you to the hospital
and have further examination

1616
01:45:57,169 --> 01:45:58,369
Thank you

1617
01:45:58,869 --> 01:46:00,669
Is Sonoko all right?

1618
01:46:01,269 --> 01:46:04,269
She's not injured at all

1619
01:46:04,869 --> 01:46:07,369
It must be that she's over scared and passed out

1620
01:46:08,569 --> 01:46:09,469
That's good

1621
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:13,669
Please write down your name and address here

1622
01:46:14,169 --> 01:46:14,569
OK

1623
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:18,469
And your BWH

1624
01:46:22,469 --> 01:46:24,369
Great landing just now

1625
01:46:24,969 --> 01:46:25,669
Ki...

1626
01:46:26,369 --> 01:46:28,469
Then we shall meet again

1627
01:46:29,269 --> 01:46:30,769
Tell me your BWH next time

1628
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:33,969
Ki... Ki...

1629
01:46:51,969 --> 01:46:52,946
Hey

1630
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:54,669
Ran, it's me

1631
01:46:55,169 --> 01:46:56,069
Shinichi?

1632
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:57,669
Listen to me...

1633
01:46:57,969 --> 01:47:00,269
It wasn't you who called a while ago, was it?

1634
01:47:01,469 --> 01:47:05,045
I knew it, it was Kiddo

1635
01:47:05,069 --> 01:47:05,569
What?

1636
01:47:05,969 --> 01:47:09,969
I felt strange, it seemed that you could see me

1637
01:47:10,269 --> 01:47:13,445
And I heard Conan shouting in the middle

1638
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:14,317
Damn

1639
01:47:15,869 --> 01:47:18,369
But Sonoko told me that Kiddo had jumped

1640
01:47:18,969 --> 01:47:21,845
Actually I was sneakingly...

1641
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,945
I got it, the guy jumped off
was Kiddo's understrapper

1642
01:47:24,969 --> 01:47:25,569
What?

1643
01:47:26,069 --> 01:47:29,045
Kiddo disguised as someone
and stayed on the plane

1644
01:47:29,069 --> 01:47:31,969
It was good that it wasn't you

1645
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,669
Not a bit

1646
01:47:33,969 --> 01:47:36,269
Very good, good that it's not blabed

1647
01:47:36,769 --> 01:47:38,445
What blabed?

1648
01:47:38,469 --> 01:47:40,869
The secret between Kiddo and me

1649
01:47:41,569 --> 01:47:42,845
Tell me

1650
01:47:42,869 --> 01:47:46,445
No, take a guess, aren't you a detective?

1651
01:47:46,469 --> 01:47:47,969
How could I know?

1652
01:47:48,469 --> 01:47:50,545
Then ask Kiddo after you've caught him

1653
01:47:50,569 --> 01:47:51,769
You!
