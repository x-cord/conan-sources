1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,083
Tonight, we're at the Tohto Tower
in the Minato ward...

2
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,875
The Tanabata Festival is being held here

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,250
at the Tohto Tower now,

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,000
there is a large crowd of people...

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,667
Yeah, I know!
Be at Doc's house by 4:00 p.m. right?

6
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,208
I mean, Genta,

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,208
don't you be late either! See you.

8
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,500
All I need now is a flashlight...

9
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,958
Uh I'm sure that...

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,208
it was in this drawer...

11
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,833
H, here it is...

12
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,042
Huh?

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,375
Who is it?... Ran?

14
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,083
Pop's out playing Mahjong...

15
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,000
Ha,

16
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,458
ha... I guess it's just my imagination.

17
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:22,250
Long time no see, Shinichi Kudo...

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,375
No... you're Conan Edogawa now...

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,583
Phooey... I had no idea that
you'd be alive with the body of a brat...

20
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,125
You can say that again, boss...

21
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,000
Really a surprise...

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,417
How?! How did they figure out my identity...?

23
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,833
Conan?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,042
Conan, is anything wrong?

25
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,292
I heard a loud sound just now...

26
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,583
Conan?

27
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,125
Watch closely...

28
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:57,292
the kind of fate the people who have
become involved with you have to tread...

29
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,292
Conan, are you all right...

30
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,208
Conan...

31
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,333
Are you inside?

32
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,917
I'm coming in...

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,042
Conan?

34
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,917
Ran...

35
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,375
Darn... What a crummy dream...

36
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:03,792
(The Raven Chaser)

37
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:12,167
I'm a High School Detective Shinichi Kudo.

38
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,542
I went to an amusement park
with my classmate and childhood friend,

39
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,042
Ran Mouri,

40
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:19,833
and happened to witness the
dangerous dealing of men dressed in black...

41
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,042
Since I was so absorbed in watching the deal

42
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,292
I didn't notice the other man dressed in
black who was approaching me from behind...

43
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,458
That man shoved a poison drug down my throat

44
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,125
and when I got up...

45
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,542
my body was shrunk!!

46
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,208
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is alive

47
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,792
they'd come after me again

48
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,417
and endanger the lives
of all the people around me...

49
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,750
I decided to hide my true identity
thanks to Doc's advice.

50
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,917
So, when Ran asked me my name,

51
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,708
I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa.

52
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,583
In order to gather information
on those guys in black

53
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,042
I decided to freeload at Ran's house
being that her father was a private eye...

54
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,250
The Black Organization
that is obscured in mystery...

55
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,625
Gin...

56
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,833
Vodka...

57
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,042
Belmot...

58
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,917
Chianti... Korn...

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,417
And, Sherry...

60
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,833
Her real name is Shiho Miyano...

61
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,833
Since her parents who had passed away
when she was still young

62
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,083
used to be scientists
working for the Black Organization,

63
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,792
she was called by the code name Sherry

64
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,625
and worked for them as well.

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,458
She was the one who had developed
the drug called Apotoxin 4869...

66
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,458
However, after her only older sister,

67
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,625
Akemi Miyano is killed by the Organization,

68
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,833
she rebels against the Organization

69
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,000
and decides to take her own life
by drinking the poisoned drug,

70
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,292
only to find that her body had shrunk...

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,167
Therefore, she changes her name
to AI Haibara at present,

72
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,375
successfully fleeing
being pursued by the Organization.

73
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,625
She leads a life of a first grader just like
me at the elementary school I attend.

74
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,333
Amidst all this, I confronted Belmot

75
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,917
and got hold of a clue...

76
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,583
You better not,

77
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,500
If you pull that out,

78
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,875
my comrades will receive...

79
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:17,375
notice of your boss's mail address...

80
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,167
S, Seven crow chicks?!

81
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,125
Yeah,

82
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,750
when the boss's mail address is keyed in

83
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,417
that's what it sounds like...

84
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,417
The song "Seven Baby Crows"

85
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,833
Don't tell me
you sent mail to that address...

86
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,500
Don't be silly...
I wouldn't do something like that...

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,542
Well, I'll send mail to this address

88
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,333
after Officer Takagi
tracks down who owns it...

89
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,958
They'll kill him...

90
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,375
as soon as Officer Takagi

91
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:44,625
tries to track down who owns it...

92
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,042
And if that should ever happen,

93
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:50,708
they'll come after you
who provided the mail address...

94
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,625
Now that you know,

95
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,708
don't pry further and just forget about it...

96
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,167
Because... that mail address is

97
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,375
a Pandora's box
that should never be opened...

98
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,042
A child with the brains of an adult

99
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,667
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

100
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,167
There is always only one truth!!

101
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,958
(Beika Forest)

102
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,042
Oh! There it is...

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,042
I've found a stag beetle!

104
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,333
All right

105
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,250
Stag beetles are at the top after all!

106
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,958
Okay, I'm going up too!!

107
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,708
No, Genta, don't!

108
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,333
I think it's better you don't

109
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,458
I guess not.

110
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,042
Only Conan or a monkey

111
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,625
is capable of climbing up
to a high place like that.

112
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,833
Sorry I'm a monkey...

113
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,583
That's right, use your suspenders!

114
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,750
Suspenders...

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,250
Oh... You mean this, that you gave me
back at your house a while ago?

116
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,625
Right... I revised it so that

117
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,583
it extends up to 100 meters
with a push of the button...

118
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,625
It keeps on extending
while you're pushing the button,

119
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,375
then, when you push the button
the next time, it shrinks rapidly!

120
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,083
S, Sorry...

121
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,458
Come on, be careful, will you...

122
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,417
I found a stag beetle!!

123
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,417
Aren't you lucky, Genta...

124
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,708
It's a beetle!!

125
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,042
It stopped!

126
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,417
Wow, there're two of them!

127
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,250
It's a male and female...

128
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,042
Huh?...

129
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:41,125
This female beetle has a tape
stuck on to its front wing...

130
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,292
See...

131
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,333
True, how cruel!!

132
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,333
Huh? There's something written on it...

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,042
Uh...

134
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,792
Oh, it says OPEN.

135
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,458
You can find it on lunches
sold in convenience stores...

136
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,667
The same tape was on the fried chicken lunch
about yesterday...

137
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,375
Fried chicken...?

138
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,292
You secretly went out and ate something
that would make you fat again...

139
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,125
Uh...

140
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,542
L, Let's see, I'll peel it off.

141
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,667
Oh, okay...

142
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,958
Who could've done something like this...

143
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,667
If they're male and female

144
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:15,125
they could be lovers, right?

145
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,833
Okay, then, I'll name them!!

146
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,208
Uh...

147
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,333
the male is Altair

148
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,875
and the female is Vega!

149
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,542
That's nice

150
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,542
Come to think of it,
it's almost Tanabata. (Star Festival)

151
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,708
Speaking of Tanabata...

152
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,708
Okay... it's peeled off...

153
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,167
Now, for the long awaited quiz time.

154
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,125
Nobody's waiting...

155
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,292
On Tanabata evening of a certain year,

156
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:41,583
it rained so hard that
Altair and Vega couldn't see each other...

157
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,667
The two who were troubled,

158
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,042
thought very hard created a day
called "Koi Tomo No Hi"

159
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:49,958
which meant a day to spend with your lover,

160
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,625
and decided to see each other anyway...

161
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,458
Now, which day did they choose?

162
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,625
Number 1: January 1st, New Year's Day...

163
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,958
Number 2: February 2nd, (Setsubun)
Seasonal Division Day...

164
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,375
Number 3, March 3rd, (Momo no Sekku)
Girls' Day...

165
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,833
Number 4, May 5th, (Tango no Sekku)
Boys' Day...

166
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,958
I got it!

167
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,583
Number 3, Girls' Day, right?!

168
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:20,292
Because The Emperor and Empress are lovers!

169
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,625
No, it's Boys' Day, May 5th, (Tango no Sekku)

170
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,917
because the passionate dance

171
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,958
you dance with a lover is the tango!

172
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,458
I say, it's number 1!!

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,958
Because I'll eat rice cake in soup
with my lover on New Year's Day!

174
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,083
Oh!

175
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,792
You can sure think up a lot of things...

176
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,833
What's the correct answer, Doc?

177
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,375
Number 4, May 5th.

178
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,417
I did it!

179
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,083
But, my way of thinking is different...

180
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,750
May 5th is Children's Day...

181
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,083
When you take Children's Day apart

182
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,500
Ko, i, to, mo, no, hi...

183
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,708
In other words,
A day to spend with your lover, right?

184
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,417
I see...

185
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:59,625
You deliberately used the
short cut way of saying it, right?

186
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,542
"Koi tomo no hi" Day
to spend with you lover...

187
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,292
I hope that Altair and Vega

188
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,792
get to stay together forever...

189
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,792
But,

190
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,167
Altair and Vega,
what a mismatching name to give beetles.

191
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,292
Oh? I don't think so.

192
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,083
In fact, it's an unlikely but perfect match,

193
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,292
I'd say. Weaver's star is called Vega...

194
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,917
The tape stuck onto the female beetle

195
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,292
sort of looks like
the initial "V" doesn't it?

196
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,917
True!

197
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,000
Absolutely!

198
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,958
Yep.

199
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:36,208
And, how do I get down?

200
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,833
Darn, what the hell's going on?

201
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,458
Stop! Stop!

202
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,458
Darn!!

203
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,042
Hey, you, are you okay?!

204
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,875
-Hey, call an ambulance!
-Yes, sir!

205
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,333
To... day...
is the Star Festival... (Tanabata)

206
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,125
Hey, get a hold of yourself!!
The ambulance will be here soon!!

207
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,500
Hey! Hey! You!!

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,833
Get a hold of yourself!!

209
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,750
Listen...

210
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,875
I brought you along as a special favor

211
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,000
so stay put and wait, understand!

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,875
Okay.

213
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,375
Oh, dad, your necktie's crooked...

214
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,042
Oh, Mr. Mouri...

215
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,042
Thank you for coming all this way
from so early in the morning...

216
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,125
Good morning, Ran, Conan.

217
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,708
Good morning.

218
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,500
I hear it's a serial murder
committed throughout a wide area.

219
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,292
Yes, sir...

220
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,667
At the site of the murder that was committed
the day before yesterday

221
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,458
at the toll street in Odawara City,

222
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,917
a Mahjong tile was found...

223
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,458
Likewise, cases where
a Mahjong tile was found occurred

224
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,458
in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Nagano.

225
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,167
We've found that 5 cases in all
have occurred in each prefecture.

226
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,542
I see...

227
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,917
Well, we can go over the details
at the conference...

228
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:15,708
Yeah...

229
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,792
After you...

230
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,792
Oooh! It's you, Mr. Mouri!

231
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,042
Long time no see!!

232
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,958
You always talk so loud,

233
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,125
Yokomizo...

234
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,625
I'm Sango...

235
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,875
This is my younger brother, Jyugo.

236
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,500
I know... I've seen him many times.

237
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,875
S, Sango, Jyugo...
(Sango-Jyugo means 3 X 5=15 in Japanese)

238
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,708
And... who is that woman?

239
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,125
Pardon me.

240
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,958
She's from the Saitama Prefectural
Police Department, Inspector Hagino...

241
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,250
(Ayami Hagino Saitama Police)
I'm Ayami Hagino,

242
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,208
I've heard a lot about you...

243
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,083
Well, what a surprise
that there's such a beauty

244
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,750
at the Saitama Prefectural Police...

245
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,208
She's was my subordinate
when I working in Saitama.

246
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,250
Saitama Prefectural Police?...

247
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,875
Since the home of the victim
that was killed was located in Tokorozawa,

248
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,750
I was called to attend the conference...

249
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,583
What brings you here, Mr. Mouri?

250
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,333
He came here by request of
Superintendent Matsumoto

251
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,292
as a special advisor.

252
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:22,625
How wretched to have to ask help
from a private eye...

253
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,792
You can say that again...

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,583
If I'm not mistaken you're...

255
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,125
Inspector Kansuke Yamato of
the Nagano Prefectural Police Station...

256
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,208
And...

257
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,375
the klutz police detective
from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station...

258
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,833
Oh, please Mr. Mouri,

259
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,333
(Misao Yamamura Gunma Police)
I've got a decent name,

260
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,292
Misao Yamamura, you know.

261
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,292
See...

262
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:43,000
Didn't the case
occur in Nagano Prefecture, though...?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,875
Why is the police
of the Gunma Prefecture here...

264
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,917
The site of the murder was right on
the border of Nagano and Gunma...

265
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:49,750
that's why...

266
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,208
The body of the murder victim from knee down

267
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,167
was inside the border of
the Gunma Prefecture... You see.

268
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,875
Rather, now that I know what your name is...

269
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,917
In, Inspector?!

270
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,250
You mean, you've become an inspector...

271
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,125
Oh, so you noticed?

272
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,750
Thanks to everyone,
I've successfully been promoted to Inspector.

273
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,875
You've become an Inspector,

274
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,417
Is the Gunma Prefectural Police Station
all right, or what...

275
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,167
By the way,

276
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,167
isn't that boy wearing glasses here today?

277
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,792
Boy wearing glasses?...

278
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,083
You mean Conan?

279
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,375
Yes, yes, Conan Edogawa

280
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,000
For some reason cases are solved
when he's around...

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,792
Come to think of it,
it was the same for me too...

282
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,667
Same here!

283
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,125
Oh,
so all of you experienced the same thing!

284
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,583
The same goes for us too.

285
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,042
I seem to lose consciousness part
way through,

286
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,250
and when I come to, the case is solved.

287
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,125
Shoots!

288
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,208
You lose consciousness...?

289
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,083
Really?

290
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,042
Not me...

291
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,500
Never happened...

292
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,917
Huh? You mean I'm the only one?...

293
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,833
You're the only police detective

294
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,000
that I can shoot the needle
of my tranquilizer gun into...

295
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,333
That's strange...

296
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,583
Yes, yes, we would like to
start the conference soon...

297
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,542
I, I'm sorry...

298
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,417
Mr. Mouri...

299
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,583
Hey, Mr. Mouri...

300
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,125
Who's that?

301
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,333
That evil looking person...

302
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,417
You idiot!

303
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,083
(Kiyonaga Matsumoto TMPD Police)
He's Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto!

304
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,375
What?! With a face like that?!

305
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,833
If you don't hold your tongue,
he's going to punch you out...

306
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,292
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

307
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,792
First of all, in order to solve the 6th case,

308
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:33,000
the common points
all the previous 5 cases have are...

309
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,667
A large knife was used in all the cases.

310
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,083
Moreover,
judging from the shape of the wounds,

311
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,750
we think that the knife
was flung down with the right hand.

312
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,875
On top of that, all 5 victims
were kidnapped using a stun gun,

313
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,250
and killed at the scene of the crime,
then left behind.

314
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,375
One question arises though.

315
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,458
In spite of the fact that the victims were
rendered immobile,

316
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,375
why did the murderer go out of the way
to move the victims

317
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,000
all the way to another place then kill them?

318
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:04,333
Moreover,

319
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,750
Mahjong tiles
with a round red emblem in front,

320
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,917
with alphabets and black vertical lines
in the back

321
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,917
were found by the corpse of all six cases...

322
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:16,167
I'm sure that this is a message
left behind by the suspect.

323
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,792
The round red emblem is the 7 of circles.

324
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,792
Of the four circles located below,

325
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:26,000
the painted circle on the top right
and to the bottom left are missing.

326
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,292
The alphabets are two As, then E, H and Z.

327
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:33,125
You turn it inside out
and get an upside down L...

328
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,292
On top of that, of all the things
that the six victims usually have on them,

329
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:40,792
one thing that has been taken away
from each of them.

330
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,125
A pendant, a pouch, a lucky charm bag...

331
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,292
A motorbike key holder, a compact,

332
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,333
and mascot doll...

333
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,125
Maybe the victims lost it

334
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,375
when they were kidnapped?

335
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,167
No,

336
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,250
since one thing was taken from all 6 victims,

337
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,542
it's only natural to think that the suspect
took them away.

338
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:00,833
Hmm...

339
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,000
so it all boils down
to the meaning of the message.

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,542
There's one more message.

341
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,208
It's a dying message left behind
by the sixth victim Ryuzaki,

342
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,792
"It's Tanabata... today... "

343
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:18,250
It could be that Ryuzaki saw the suspect
at the rest house at the Hakone-Turn Pike

344
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,208
where the brake oil of his car
was supposedly drained...

345
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,667
Uh... Everyone,

346
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,625
I think you're thinking too hard, maybe?

347
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,042
The Mahjong tile indicates
just what it is, Mahjong!

348
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,833
The motive of the murder is just what it is,

349
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,708
trouble over a game of Mahjong!

350
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
There was the 1 of circles and 7 of circles,

351
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,917
which indicates that 8 people
were playing Mahjong.

352
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,250
And of the 7 of circles,

353
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,042
there are two with no red painting on it...

354
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,542
One of the two indicates the suspect

355
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,333
and the other tile
indicates the final victim!

356
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,958
Which means that
there will be more murders?!

357
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,750
Yes... most probably...

358
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,667
But if it's indicating 8 members,

359
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,000
would the 8 of circles be better?

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,958
The 1 of circles and the 7 of circles
hold another meaning...

361
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,708
That is, the suspect
just needed either of the tiles...

362
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,250
the 1 or the 7of circles to win the game!!

363
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,417
Moreover, his hand was a big one
that would make him the top winner!!

364
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,750
I see!!

365
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,250
However, somebody else won with
a small and cheap hand!

366
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,292
That's why the suspect got angry?!

367
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,583
Exactly...

368
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:29,917
I'm sure that the other members were also
playing a similar sly game too.

369
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:33,292
I'm sure the suspect couldn't stand it...

370
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:36,542
This, was the motive for the murder!!

371
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,958
Then, what do the alphabets mean?

372
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,125
Why were the victims taken deliberately
to a different place and then killed?

373
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,958
And...

374
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,708
What is the meaning of
Mr. Ryuzaki's dying message...

375
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,208
W, Well... you see...

376
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,458
That's...

377
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,167
I'll get to that... later on... you see...

378
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,792
Superintendent...

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,792
Could the six places

380
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:07,083
have a special meaning to the suspect?

381
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,333
If there is,

382
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,958
chances are high

383
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,750
that it would lead us to a clue
of who the suspect is.

384
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,250
And, the six victims.

385
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,583
I'm sure that the six are in some way
connected to the suspect...

386
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,333
The fastest way to track down the suspect

387
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,750
would be to find what the six have in common.

388
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,583
It's true that as Mouri had mentioned,

389
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,333
it most likely has
something to do with Mahjong.

390
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,583
Moreover, we've got to figure out
the meaning of the alphabets

391
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,958
and vertical lines that
were written on the back of the tiles,

392
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:40,167
as well as the meaning
of the dying message, "Tanabata today."

393
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,333
Listen, all of you!

394
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,708
Chances are high that the suspect
will commit more murders in the future!

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,708
We've got to avoid that from happening
at all cost

396
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,542
over the dignity of the police!!

397
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,542
Forget all petty things

398
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:54,208
such as whose jurisdiction is where,
or personal ambitions,

399
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,542
and make public all the information you get.

400
00:19:56,542 --> 00:20:00,208
We'll all share whatever findings there are
and nab the serial killer

401
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,000
by all means as soon as we possibly can!!

402
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,042
Aye!!

403
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,167
The john, the john... I'm going to leak!

404
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,875
I guess the conference is over...

405
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,875
I guess so.

406
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,792
Oh... Superintendent Matsumoto...

407
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,083
Long time no see.

408
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,875
How is Sayuri?

409
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,958
O, Oh... You're Mouri's...

410
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,042
Well, my daughter's the same as ever...

411
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,417
See you, Mouri... I'm counting on you.

412
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,042
Yes, sir!! I, Kogoro Mouri

413
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,708
will with all my heart

414
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,500
and soul meet up to your expectation!!

415
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,208
Hmm...

416
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,500
Have a nice day!

417
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,083
Huh?

418
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,417
Officer Chiba, did you lose weight a bit?

419
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,958
Oh, you noticed?

420
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,250
I'm dieting recently.

421
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,250
You know, the morning program
aired on TV now?

422
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,917
Talking of slimming down...

423
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:00,875
Shiratori,

424
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,708
it seems that you on the other hand
gained weight?

425
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:06,917
Ugh... Y, You've gotta be joking, Mr. Mouri!

426
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,667
I may not look it,
but I go to the gym twice a week.

427
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
How unusual,

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,833
for you to drink black coffee, Sango.

429
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,958
Yeah, I've been told by my doctor recently
to cut out on sweets...

430
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,667
I thought you didn't like... yourself?

431
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,958
There're been three murders in a row,

432
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,542
that I need some sugar to keep me going!

433
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,208
Uh, Inspector Yokomizo?

434
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:33,208
Oh, no, I mean the older one...

435
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,083
Uh...

436
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,583
Is that the boy, Conan Edogawa

437
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,083
that you happened to mention
just a while ago?

438
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,875
Yeah...

439
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,958
I don't know if it's because he's always
listening to Mr. Mouri's deductions,

440
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,917
but he sometimes
comes up with amazing hints!

441
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,042
Besides, he's really observant
and notices things

442
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,333
that we professionals tend to overlook.

443
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,708
Is that so...

444
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:00,375
Little baby crows... why are you crying...

445
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,125
The crows are in the mountains

446
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,167
Whaaa!!

447
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,917
"Officer" Yamamura! That song!

448
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,375
Hey I guess you're not aware

449
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,333
because you weren't listening but...

450
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,500
Why were you singing that song just now?

451
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,875
"Inspector" Yamamura!

452
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,042
Why...?

453
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,375
because I heard it outside the men's room
just a while ago...

454
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,083
Like the buttons of a cell phone
were being pushed...

455
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:28,917
When I came out of the men's room,

456
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,500
An officer wearing glasses was
making a call on his cell phone.

457
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,375
H, Huh?

458
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,625
Hey, Conan?!

459
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,042
It can't be?!...

460
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,708
Don't tell me that they...

461
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,083
It can't be?!

462
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,667
There he is!

463
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,667
H, Hey, Conan? What's the matter?

464
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,917
Darn!

465
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,000
I've got to go pee!!

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,917
C, Conan?!

467
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,292
The men's room's right here...

468
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,417
That car was a Porsche 356A...

469
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,958
Gin's car...

470
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,458
Why...? What brings them here

471
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,750
to the investigation conference...?
What're they after...

472
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,542
What?! They snuck into
the investigation conference?!

473
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,750
Shh! Keep your voice down!

474
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,333
I hope Ai's okay.

475
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,542
Yeah... she should be in the basement lab.

476
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:37,667
I'm sure that the one who was disguised
as a police detective was Belmot.

477
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,750
I'll bet she was mailing the results
of the conference to her boss

478
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,333
while waiting for the elevator.

479
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:47,125
I see,
so that's what Officer Yamamura heard...

480
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,958
The buttons that sound like the song,

481
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,167
"Seven Baby Crows"
when pushed to send mail...

482
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,375
But, why...

483
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,417
I tell you...

484
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,542
The two of you
keeping secrets from me again...

485
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,625
Ai...

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,667
And? Why do you think it's Belmot?

487
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,875
You can't tell just by
the sound of the buttons being pushed...

488
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,833
Gin's Porsche was there...

489
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:12,042
It would be too risky for them
to sneak into the police bare faced.

490
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,333
If someone were to be in disguise,

491
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,958
then chances are high that it was Belmot...

492
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:18,958
At any rate,

493
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,250
there's no doubt
that the cases are in some way

494
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,958
connected with the guys in black...

495
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,375
So, I'd like to check the cases myself.

496
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,792
Will you help me?

497
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,375
I don't mind...

498
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,250
You wouldn't quit even if I told you to,
would you...

499
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,125
But, be very careful...

500
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,167
I'm sure you already know but,

501
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,667
if they find out
what your true identity is...

502
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:48,292
Yeah... I know.

(Hayakawa Toll Gate)

511
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,417
Huh? They don't play Mahjong?

512
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:20,208
No...

513
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,208
As a result of our questioning,

514
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,542
we've found that
all six of the victims didn't play Mahjong.

515
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,417
It's too bad,

516
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,208
but I guess your deduction
wasn't correct, Mouri...

517
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,125
Oh...

518
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,292
We've hit a dead end...

519
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,583
I wish that Shinichi Kudo were around...

520
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,667
Kudo, you mean,

521
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,958
the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

522
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,667
that you frequently ask for help
with investigation?

523
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,042
Yes, I guess...

524
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,500
Come to think of it,
there's not much talk about him recently.

525
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,083
Maybe he just got tired
of playing detective?

526
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,333
Oh, no, that's not it.

527
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,708
Just the other day, he solved a case

528
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,542
at Teitan High School's school festival...

529
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,458
Officer Takagi!

530
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,375
Huh?...

531
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,750
Oh, I'm sorry, I sort of got carried away...

532
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,667
Just what do you mean?

533
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,125
He wants us to keep it a secret

534
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,708
that he's involved in solving the cases.

535
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,875
I see...

536
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,125
Oh! he sure is a modest person.

537
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,625
He's recently become that way
for some reason...

538
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,583
In the past he really used to like being
in the spotlight and getting attention...

539
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,250
I guess being absent from school
for two days, was not worth much.

540
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,583
N, No... I guess not...

541
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,292
Did you figure out the meaning of
the mahjong tiles and the alphabets?

542
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,333
I still haven't figured that out yet...

543
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,458
I don't know what "Tanabata today"
means either...

544
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,167
Wow! Mitsuko,

545
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,125
you're good

546
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,208
That's a beetle, isn't it?

547
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:58,417
Yes, I'm pretty good with things like this.

548
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,833
But, what a crummy thing to do,

549
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,083
sticking tape onto the wings...

550
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,333
Oh, you mean Vega...

551
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,375
I wonder who did that...

552
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,708
Really...

553
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,083
By the way, Genta,

554
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,958
Is that a snake that you're making?

555
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,875
Can't you tell just looking at it...

556
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,583
It's an eel. E-E-L!

557
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,917
E, El again...

558
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,792
You really like eels, don't you, Genta...

559
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,500
Even the other day you wrote eels

560
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,083
on the piece of paper decorating
the Tanabata tree too, right?

561
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,833
(I want to eat eel)

562
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,667
Come to think of it, Tanabata is tomorrow...

563
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,917
Tanabata... today...

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,833
What does it mean...

565
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,083
Bad... you should have it turned off
during the conference...

566
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:54,917
Excuse me...

567
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,292
It's me...

568
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,542
Oh... Yeah...

569
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,500
And?...

570
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,375
What?!

571
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,958
Yeah, I got it!

572
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,333
Good news...

573
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,958
A man
that could possibly be the serial killer

574
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,042
may show up in Beika City.

575
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,750
What?!

576
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,917
Minoru Fukase, age 27...

577
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,000
is on the wanted list

578
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,792
for stabbing and badly wounding Shuhei Jinno,

579
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,083
who was murdered at Usui Pass...

580
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:30,958
I had one of my men keep an eye on his lover,

581
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,125
and just got word that
she headed from Nagano to Tokyo

582
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,958
and got off at Beika Station...

583
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,917
Her name's Lisa Yoshii, age 21...

584
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,542
I hear she's working at
a snack in Nagano city...

585
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:46,417
And? What was Fukase's motive
for stabbing Mr. Jinno?

586
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,750
When they were in a line at Tropical Land,

587
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,875
Jinno seems to have
told him to stop smoking...

588
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,458
Tropical Land...

589
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,083
Officer Takagi?
Did you figure something out?

590
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,667
Maybe...

591
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,625
Maybe all the other victims
were standing in the same line?

592
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,708
What? Explain in detail.

593
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,792
Yes, sir...

594
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:15,875
Two types of Mahjong tiles
were left near the victims.

595
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,458
Mr. Jinno's 1 of circles and,

596
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,000
the 7 of circles that were by the others...

597
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,708
If you set the position of the red circle

598
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,250
of each Mahjong tile like this...

599
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:33,333
maybe the victims were
lined up in this order.

600
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,292
I see...

601
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,167
Then, Fukase's the one who...

602
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,500
Okay, Megure,

603
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,250
take your men
and accompany Inspector Yamato!

604
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,125
I tell you...

605
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,375
why do you have to tag along too...?

606
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,500
I've always wanted to
speed along on the Shuto Expressway!

607
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,208
How about you, Inspector Yamato? Huh? Hu?

608
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,250
Over here!

609
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,083
Okay!

610
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,208
Okay, let's stake out just as planned!

611
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,958
Is it the suspect?

612
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,792
Or, could he be...

613
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,000
Minoru!!

614
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,208
Fukase's shown up...

615
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,042
All of you, stay in place and wait...

616
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,583
Don't let him see you!

617
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,250
Hurry! Hurry!

618
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:39,958
The game house is on the 7th floor, right?

619
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,083
Yep, let's eat ice cream on the way home!

620
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,125
I want a double with vanilla and chocolate!

621
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,708
Inspector, there are children near Fukase...

622
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:49,750
Stay cool.

623
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,292
We're nabbing him
after the children distance away from Fukase.

624
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,125
Roger!

625
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,625
Which floor is this?

626
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,958
We have one more floor to go

627
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,333
They passed the 5th floor.

628
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:11,875
Next is the 7th floor.

629
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,500
Okay, nab him!

630
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,333
Roger...

631
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,667
-Ro...
-Roger!!

632
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,792
H, Hey.

633
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,125
That idiot!

634
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,000
Fukase! Freeze!!

635
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,875
Police!!

636
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,333
You can't get away!

637
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,417
Darn!

638
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,083
Don't, Fukase!!

639
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,833
Stay away!!

640
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,167
If you don't I'm going to kill this broad!!

641
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,125
Darn!

642
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,583
Don't move!

643
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,333
If you don't want me
to drive this through you!

644
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,167
No! You can't get away
even if you do something like that!

645
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,417
Shut up! Stay away!!

646
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,167
Stay away!! Ow...

647
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,667
You guys stand back too!!

648
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,417
O, Okay, cool it, will you...

649
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,125
How dare he make us waste our time...

650
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,917
It seems he's passed out...

651
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,167
But, why...

652
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,750
Pull away...

653
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,917
Pull away from Minoru...

654
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,667
Get away from Minoru...

655
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,917
Calm down, Lisa,

656
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,250
put the knife down...

657
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,958
No.

658
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,250
Doing something like that
isn't going to help you at all.

659
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,667
Put the knife down.

660
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:44,167
No...

661
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,792
Let go of Minoru!!

662
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,333
Okay... that's enough, Lisa...

663
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,667
No need to commit further crime...

664
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,958
I, I'm sorry...

665
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,292
Are you all right, Inspector?!

666
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,292
No need to worry.

667
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:20,375
I've got especially lots of fat on my belly.

668
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,500
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,667
I'm really sorry...

670
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,583
I'm to blame for being off guard...

671
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,833
Well,

672
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,417
we can't have any police detectives
that aren't in this jurisdiction

673
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,417
getting hurt here, so it's okay...

674
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,208
Huh?

675
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,667
What's up?

676
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,667
Well, the woman who was being held hostage...

677
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,792
Huh?

678
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,292
Are you sure...?
Do you really want to leave as is...?

679
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:05,167
Didn't you have
something to say to that man?

680
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,958
Belmot.

681
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,583
Fuh...

682
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,333
What can I do about it?

683
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,667
You're the one
who made it turn out this way, right?

684
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:16,083
Besides, I don't think that he's the culprit.

685
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,417
Yeah, you're right...

686
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:22,458
Take it easy on me, will you...

687
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,750
I hurt my right shoulder...

688
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,917
You hurt your right shoulder...

689
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,250
Come to think of it, just a while ago you.

690
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,542
Stay away!! Ow...

691
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,167
It's impossible for a man

692
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,042
who cannot raise his right arm
to fling down a knife...

693
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:39,000
Unless he hurt himself
after committing the crime.

694
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,875
It's amazing how you figured out it was me.

695
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,000
Your leg.

696
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,292
Leg?!

697
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,792
Your right ankle's swollen...

698
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,458
You've got a gun stashed in there, right?

699
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,750
Besides, despite being slashed on the cheek
with his knife,

700
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,333
not even one drop of blood is dripping.

701
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,958
Darn...

702
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,792
I've got to think up a mask
that will bleed next time then...

703
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,750
It's most likely that you deliberately
set yourself up as hostage from your side,

704
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,375
then after pulling him away from the police,

705
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:22,125
you were going to turn around and kill him
with that gun of yours.

706
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:26,417
Well, you probably didn't even have to
use a gun to get at him though...

707
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:29,500
I didn't think
that you would be complimenting me...

708
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,083
Why are you and your organization

709
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,083
pursuing this murder case?

710
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,333
You sure are straightforward...

711
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,875
Tell me!

712
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,417
NOC.

713
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,375
NOC...

714
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,000
Non Official Cover...

715
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,292
A member of the Organization
that's disguised

716
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,792
as a lay person is among the victims?

717
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,917
Right... We found out that the NOC...

718
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,750
be it for insurance measures or what,

719
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,667
is carrying around the memory card

720
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,417
with the data of the NOC list
of the Organization around.

721
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,292
That person was to be killed
by the Organization soon...

722
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,750
However...

723
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,083
That person
was killed by someone else instead...

724
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,000
Right...

725
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,208
and that killer
made away with the memory card,

726
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,292
most probably unaware of what it is.

727
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,042
I see...

728
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:21,250
If the killer is nabbed by the police
and that data is seen,

729
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,917
that's a lot of trouble...

730
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,125
That's why...

731
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,083
You coming here means

732
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,250
that there's a NOC among the investigators...

733
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,500
No, rather,

734
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,875
you set up one of your men to disguise
himself as one of the investigators!

735
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,917
That's why you snuck into
the investigation conference, right?

736
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,833
You wanted to make sure that the member
was doing all right under disguise...

737
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,292
Otherwise, you would've still
been undercover at the conference...

738
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,875
Who is?! Who's the guy disguised as?!

739
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,458
Is the real investigator safe?!

740
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:54,833
This is as much as I can tell you...

741
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,208
The rest is up to you to find out...

742
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,708
His code name is Irish...

743
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,625
Irish...

744
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes...

745
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,875
It's a mild tasting whiskey...

746
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,667
security guard!

747
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,958
He seems to be lost...

748
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,458
What? Lost?

749
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,708
Oh, no...

750
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,583
Good luck...

751
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,542
I hope you the best...

752
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:27,917
Darn...

753
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,042
Yes, this is Megure. Oh,

754
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,250
Superintendent.

755
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,708
I just got a call from an artist
named Sumire Shindo

756
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:43,667
saying that she has an idea
who the serial killer may be.

757
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,792
Her address is Hachioji...

758
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,292
Yes! Yes! Understood.

759
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,625
Sato, Takagi,

760
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,625
Go to Hachioji on the double!

761
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,417
Yes, sir!

762
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,208
Okay, Sumire Shindo, got you...

763
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,125
No good boss, from here

764
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,750
even if we were to beat the cops there,

765
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,792
we'll end up confronting them
before we get rid of her...

766
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,542
We're not going to face the police...

767
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,167
Yeah, it's me...

768
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,958
We did it!
We made it just in the nick of time!

769
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:23,875
I get the right...

770
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,125
Okay, I get the left.

771
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,625
Cute boy.

772
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,417
Foxy chick...

773
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,958
W, What was that?!...

774
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,125
Cool it!
Go slowly to the shoulder of the road.

775
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,250
My god...

776
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,667
It's a flat after all...

777
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,958
This side too...

778
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:03,875
Officer Takagi, call Inspector Shiratori!

779
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,000
Yes, ma'am

780
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:14,792
Darn! I guess we were a bit late.

781
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:18,000
We shouldn't hang around too long.
Let's get going.

782
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,083
What?! She's not there?!

783
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,417
It's not that she left home, is it?

784
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,542
No, there are signs of struggle in the room,

785
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:35,500
and it seems that the culprit
took her away in a car

786
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,625
Search for her right away!

787
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,083
And please also get the forensic officers.

788
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,292
Okay

789
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,250
Bye...

790
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:44,833
Officer Takagi...

791
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:46,750
What is it?

792
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,875
Ms. Sato?

793
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,458
An investigator?

794
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,625
Yeah, his code name is Irish...

795
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,042
Do you know him?

796
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:07,458
No... I never heard of him.

797
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,917
I see...

798
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,958
If we at least can tell
what kind of guy he is,

799
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,125
we may be able to figure out
who he's disguised as...

800
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,542
I don't think you should get involved.

801
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:18,958
If that guy called Irish is disguised
as one of the investigators,

802
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,833
he would've gotten suspicious about you

803
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,792
after you noticed Belmot
in the conference room

804
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,500
and ran out after her...

805
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,042
Yeah... But...

806
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,250
Don't you understand?!

807
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,375
The more you solve the case,

808
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:32,792
the more you're proving
that you're Shinichi Kudo!!

809
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:33,792
Ai...

810
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,625
I understand you worrying...

811
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,417
But, I can't afford not solving the case.

812
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:52,583
The life of the investigator that Irish
is disguised as is in danger.

813
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:55,542
At any rate,

814
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,833
there's no doubt that Irish was among

815
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,333
the investigators
that attended the conference.

816
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,333
I've got to figure out who he is,
while at the same time

817
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,917
catch the culprit before those guys do

818
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,375
and get a hold of the memory card
that he took away from NOC!

819
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,333
With just that one card

820
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,042
I could maybe crush them all!

821
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:20,292
But, are you sure
you can trust what Belmot said?

822
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:24,292
She knows that Ai is Sherry...

823
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:26,250
She probably knows who I am too...

824
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,458
However, for some reason
she hasn't told the Organization about us...

825
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,333
I've got no choice but to believe her now.

826
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,250
You're still cautious enough
to meet at a shrine.

827
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,792
Irish is the one who's cautious...

828
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,458
Well, until everything is cleared,

829
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:46,167
I don't think we should see each other
anywhere except for at school...

830

you had to switch off your cell phone...

I'm sorry. I cracked your rice bowl, Conan.

It's okay...
How unusual of you to crack a dish, Ran.

Was that Officer Takagi?

Where?

862

I heard it was at Ayase City
in Kanagawa Prefecture...

863
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,292
Was the Mahjong tile found there
the 7 of circles?

864
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,292
Yeah...

865

The red circle was at the upper right
of the 4 circles below.

On the back there were no alphabets,

Bad news! Your dolphin's fin is gone.

875

The fin?

876

Really...

877
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,375

A mysterious case has occurred.

879
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,792
It's not such a big deal.

880
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:53,375
Somebody was probably cleaning or something,

881
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:55,542
bumped into it and it fell off.

882

We looked for it,but couldn't find it.

883

It's okay,
I'll make another one and stick it on.

884
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,542
Don't tell me that... that fin...

885
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:11,250
No... don't worry...

886
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,708
No doubt about it,

887
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:16,875
it's them...

888
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,083
Come to think of it,

889
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:21,208
I still cold sweat thinking that

890
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,958
this could've turned out
to be a tragic accident...

891
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,417
Don't you think it's strange?

892
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:28,417
Getting two flat tires at the same time
is something that could never happen.

893
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,292
Then, did someone
scatter nails or something?

894
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,083
Snipers...

895
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,417
I'm sure someone shot at the tires...

896
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,000
Somewhere from this overpass...

897
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,750
I'm sure that a car was parked here...

898
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,167
No kidding...

899
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,875
You know what Officer Takagi,

900
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:47,167
this may be a freaked out idea

901
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,750
but I have a feeling...

902
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,125
that aside from the culprit,

903
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:54,167
there are other non-identifiable people
moving around in this case.

904
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,167
Unidentifiable people...

905
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,917
The paint at Ms. Shindo's atelier

906
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,042
was stepped on twice...

907
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,833
The paint was squeezed out of the tube
after being stepped on

908
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:07,375
and yet the paint that was
already pushed out was stepped on again...

909
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:11,458
Wouldn't this mean that after the culprit
kidnapped Ms. Shindo by car,

910
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,417
someone else came...

911
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,417
I wonder.

912
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:18,083
Maybe the person stuck around
till the paint dried?

913
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,458
I mean the culprit.

914
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,792
Another thing

915
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:24,875
that bugs me is the woman who disappeared
from the mall in Beika-cho.

916
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:28,167
Maybe she was one of them too.

917
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,333
Maybe she deliberately set herself
up as the hostage...

918
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,125
Huh, for what?

919
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,625
Officer Sato,
I think you're just getting carried away.

920
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,125
I guess so, maybe I am.

921
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,250
But, if this is a fact,

922
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,708
it would mean that a spy

923
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,583
who is sending them information
is among the police.

924
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:54,625
Furthermore, it's someone
who has attended the conference...

925
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,833
Huh? The helmet of the Black Knight?

926
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,333
It broke.

927
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,167
The members of the drama club were
making a fuss over it a while ago.

928
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,292
The rice bowl...

929
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,208
Huh?

930
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,000
I cracked Conan's rice bowl last night.

931
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,375
And now it's the helmet
that Shinichi used to wear...

932
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,792
It feels like a bad omen.

933
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,750
I think you taking it too far.

934
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,625
That brat and Shinichi
are two different people.

935
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,167
I know,

936
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,667
but... I'll let him know about it anyway.

937
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,625
Helmet of the Black Knight?...

938
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,500
Bad...

939
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,292
My fingerprints are on that helmet...

940
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,083
Darn...

941
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:36,208
If the dolphin's fin and the helmet

942
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:38,042
are their doings.

943
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,708
What shall I do...
I've got to think up something fast...

944
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,833
or I'll endanger
the lives of Ran and Pops too...

945
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:51,667
The memory card!

946
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,375
If only I get hold of that memory card,

947
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:55,250
I'll have the upper hand.

948
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,250
I've got to find
the culprit as soon as possible...

949
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,250
Oh, maybe it's Shinich.

950
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:01,958
Yep...

951
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,625
"I'm involved in a dangerous case right now

952
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:09,250
so don't mail or call me..." So, he says...

953
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,292
I wonder what kind of dangerous case it is?

954
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,750
The least
you could do is let me hear your voice,

955
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,000
Shinichi...

956
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,708
That should do it...

957
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:24,375
The thing that bothers me is, the message,

(Kaihou High School)
What is it you want to ask me?...

963
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:41,833
- That might be on the test...
-Yeah... Yeah...

964
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,958
I see...

965
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,708
Who're you talking to?

966
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,125
Don't scare me like that, stupid...

967
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,000
Sorry, sorry...

968
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,250
I tell you, you scared me out of my wits...

969
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,250
You're talking to someone that
you have to be so surprised about,

970
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,917
Don't be silly, it's Kudo! Kudo!

971
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,708
He asking if "Tanabata Kyoto" rings a bell.

972
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:07,250
It's about the investigation
of the serial killing case...

973
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,125
I'm sorry, Kudo.

974
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,417
Silly Kazuha is bugging me...

975
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,083
saying that "Tanabata Kyoto" could mean...

976
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,583
The Mitarashi festival?

977
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,625
The one held at Kitano Tenmangu...

978
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,417
The Tanabata Festival at
Shujin Shrine is also famous...

979
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:23,708
Right!!
Why don't we go there together tonight?

980
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,292
If you want to go, go on ahead alone.

981
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:27,708
Can you hear me, Kudo?

982
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,250
Yeah... but somehow it doesn't sound right...

983
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,750
I guess so...

984
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,167
There may be other clues...

985
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:36,917
Come on let's go.

986
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:40,625
If it's in Kyoto,
we don't even have to reserve a hotel.

987
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,750
Stupid!

988
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,167
It wouldn't even cross my mind
to stay at hotel in the first place!

989
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,125
Did you forget that big fire
that broke out the year before last?!

990
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,250
Miser.

991
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,542
Hey, Hattori.

992
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,208
What big fire?

993
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:54,625
Oh, there was a big fire in Kyoto
the year before last...

994
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,792
Come to think of it,
it was on the night of Tanabata...

995
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:59,250
Tell me more about it in detail!

996
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,333
The name of the hotel
if I remember correctly was "Vega"...

997
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:04,917
Two guests were killed in the fire...

998
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:05,875
Hattori!!

999
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,875
Check that fire in more detail for me,
will you!

1000
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,000
ASAP!!

1001
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,875
Okay!

1002
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:15,333
H, Hey, what're you doing, Heiji?

1003
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,083
Class is going to start soon, you know.

1004
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,250
Oh, tell the teacher for me, will you...

1005
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:24,250
That Heiji went to see Weaver, Vega
because it's Tanabata.

1006
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,792
-Alright!
-Huh?

1007
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,042
Hey, who's Weaver?

1008
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:30,292
Fire...

1009
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,958
Do the red seal and alphabet on the
Mahjong tiles symbolize the fire...

1010
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,625
The cause of the fire

1011
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,458
(Beikachou public library)

1012
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:47,125
was a cigarette that a guest
on the 5th floor was smoking,

1013
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,083
and the stairs of the emergency exit
couldn't be used either.

1014
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:53,125
A guest on the 6th floor was also trapped
in the smoke and died...

1015
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:57,042
Nanako Honjo... Mitaka City Jindai...

1016
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,750
(Mizutani)
Mr. Mizutani

1017
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,083
Mr. Mizutani?

1018
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:22,083
Mr. Mizutani isn't in right now...

1019
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,167
Would you have any idea where he is?

1020
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,458
Oh, so you're Detective Mouri's assistant.

1021
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:32,042
I'm Shun Sawamura.

1022
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:34,833
I'm a post graduate at
Jonan University's Law Department.

1023
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,875
Nice to meet you.

1024
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,583
Thank you.

1025
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,417
But, don't tell anybody about this, okay?

1026
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,875
It seems this investigation is top secret.

1027
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,208
Oh,

1028
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:46,583
so that's why he's using a child like you...

1029
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:50,625
And,
Mr. Kosuke Mizutani and Nanako Honjo are...

1030
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,500
They're lovers...

1031
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,583
It seems that
they went against their parent's wishes

1032
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,042
and eloped all the way here from Chiba.

1033
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:58,125
Eloped...

1034
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,458
On Tanabata the year before last...

1035
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,375
they took a trip to Kyoto

1036
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,917
and stayed over at the business hotel.

1037
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:10,375
However, he alone went to see his friend
who lives in Kyoto.

1038
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,125
It was then that the hotel caught fire...

1039
00:55:13,917 --> 00:55:16,625
He blamed himself saying that
if he hadn't gone to see his friend,

1040
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,667
Nanako wouldn't have had to die...

1041
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,875
He was crying when he said that...

1042
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:25,167
What does Mr. Mizutani do?

1043
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:27,083
He was a free-lancer,

1044
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,792
but ever since she died,

1045
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,750
he doesn't seem to have been working much.

1046
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,083
It seems he hasn't come back to his room
for some time either...

1047
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,875
I wonder where Mr. Mizutani is now?

1048
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,958
I have no idea...

1049
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,458
Oh,

1050
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,417
maybe in Chiba,

1051
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,417
because today is
the third memorial day since her death.

1052
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,833
You mean at the temple?

1053
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,375
Maybe.

1054
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:49,083
I'm sure we can find out
from her older brother.

1055
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,125
Wait here.

1056
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,958
Her older brother came to see her

1057
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:55,375
at this apartment several times
before she died

1058
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,417
you asked me to contact him

1059
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,958
if his little sister
seemed to be in trouble...

1060
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:00,958
Here, here it is!

1061
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,500
See... Her older brother's name card.

1062
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,375
And this is Mr. Mizutani.

1063
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,250
May I take this phone number down?

1064
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,208
Sure.

1065
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:17,458
Can you also give me
your cell phone number too, Mr. Sawamura?

1066
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,542
Sure.

1067
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,042
Hello, Hattori?

1068
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:29,042
Hey, Kudo, you're right on... Bull's eye!!

1069
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:32,792
The name list of the seven victims
you sent me,

1070
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:34,583
matched the name of the guest
who was staying at a room

1071
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,333
on the 6th floor at the time of the fire!

1072
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,208
There are two more people
who were guests on the 6th floor...

1073
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:42,292
Nanako Honjo and Kosuke Mizutani...

1074
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:44,417
What? You already knew...

1075
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,708
Then, how about this?

1076
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:48,583
That man called Mizutani a year ago,

1077
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,750
seems to have been investigating
the same thing I am now!

1078
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,458
There seems to be no mistake
that the murder case

1079
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:58,667
that you're after now has something to do
with the fire that occurred two years ago...

1080
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,542
But, what the hell's going on?

1081
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:05,250
Let's say that Mizutani were the culprit,
what's his motive?

1082
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,458
Ms. Honjo died of an accident, didn't she?

1083
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,458
Hattori...

1084
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,083
How many elevators does that hotel have?

1085
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:15,875
Elevator? One, I think...

1086
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:17,417
What's the maximum capacity of that elevator?

1087
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:18,500
Hold on.

1088
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:27,750
The maximum capacity is 7 people.

1089
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,417
So what, Kudo?

1090
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:36,417
Oh! I'll get off. I'm getting off.

1091
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,542
I see! I got it, Kudo!

1092
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,125
Yeah, it's most likely that
on the day of the fire,

1093
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,542
Ms. Nanako Honjo...

1094
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:48,708
Was forced off the elevator she boarded

1095
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:51,208
because the 8th guest got on

1096
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:52,625
and she was forced to get off.

1097
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,792
That 8th person

1098
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,958
was Mr. Jinno symbolized by the 1 of circles!

1099
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,208
The other six people
were all riding in the position

1100
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,375
indicated by the position of the red circle
of the 7 of circles Mahajong tile.

1101
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:07,750
The last circle is Nanako's position.

1102
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,583
Most probably.

1103
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,917
The Mahjong tile itself

1104
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:13,500
resembles the box shape of the elevator,

1105
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,458
and the black line in the middle
on the reverse side of the tile

1106
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,083
symbolizes the door.

1107
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,875
No doubt about it.

1108
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,583
Jinno got onto the elevator last
and the buzzer sounded.

1109
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,792
He forced somebody to get off
so he could get on.

1110
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,208
Nanako happened to be the one
who was forced off.

1111
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,167
The other six,
maybe pretended not to see and did nothing.

1112
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,042
Or, maybe they even helped Jinno

1113
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,542
because they themselves
didn't want to be forced off.

1114
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,333
Nanako who couldn't get on the elevator
couldn't make it out in time...

1115
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:46,000
What, is my deduction wrong?

1116
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,042
No... what bothers me is
the meaning of the alphabets on the tiles...

1117
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,458
Yeah,

1118
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,375
it's strange that
the 7th tile was not an alphabet

1119
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:56,125
but rather a triangle...

1120
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:00,500
Well, if the remaining red circle
were to be Nanako,

1121
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,458
there will be no more murders...

1122
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,000
I sure hope so...

1123
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,250
At any rate,
I'll try and find Mr. Mizutani...

1124
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,167
Thanks... Hattori...

1125
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,250
Seriously...

1126
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,708
Kudo...

1127
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:14,708
Oh!

1128
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:17,708
I found this
really delicious Okonomiyaki shop!

1129
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,458
I'll take you there,
so why don't you come over here

1130
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,042
Y, Yeah...

1131
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,708
Promise...

1132
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,542
I'll be waiting, okay...

1133
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,708
Yeah, okay...

1134
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,125
See you...

1135
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:37,417
Kudo...

1136
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,083
Promise...

1137
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,917
What?! July 7th 2 years ago?

1138
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:49,542
Were all the victims in Kyoto that day?

1139
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:52,417
Yes, we got this information
through questioning people.

1140
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,042
Which means...

1141
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:57,125
The remark, "Tanabata today..."
that the eye witness heard...

1142
00:59:57,125 --> 01:00:00,625
Meant Tanabata Kyoto, eh... (Kyo=today)

1143
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,917
That day...

1144
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:05,375
I'm having the men check
what happened that day in Kyoto but,

1145
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,542
the problem is...

1146
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:10,208
the message that the culprit left behind
on the Mahjong tile...

1147
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:14,917
The red circle on the lower left
of the 7 of circles is still blank,

1148
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:18,750
so there's a great possibility
that there will be one more victim...

1149
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,875
Moreover.

1150
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:23,208
It's probably no coincidence
that today is July 7th...

1151
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:25,792
W, which means, that the last person
will be killed today...

1152
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,583
Where and who on earth is he after...

1153
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,417
Maybe that person is among us...

1154
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,875
I got it!!

1155
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,958
These 7 sites

1156
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:47,125
were indicating
the shape of a certain animal.

1157
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,708
Animal?

1158
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,000
Listen

1159
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,708
You see, you join all the sites...

1160
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,458
like this... by drawing a line.

1161
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,125
I'm sure you can tell by now...

1162
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,917
This long line is its neck.

1163
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:06,167
This is its chest,

1164
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,000
front paws,

1165
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,917
its back,

1166
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,625
and these its hind legs.

1167
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,542
In other words!!

1168
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,708
This is not Nessie of Lochness but

1169
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:16,042
Asshee of Lake Ashino

1170
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,542
Asshee?!

1171
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,458
Ouch,

1172
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,292
You mean such a thing exists?

1173
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:25,000
No... I've never heard of it...

1174
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,750
I don't understand it much either...

1175
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,083
Then, what if I turn it this way...

1176
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,292
Hmm...

1177
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:34,208
now that you mentioned it...

1178
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,958
It does look like an Asshee...

1179
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,042
But, what makes you say it's an Asshee?

1180
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,958
It could be the Yasshee of Lake Yamanaka...

1181
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,417
Look at the shape of the lake.

1182
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,500
Lake Yamanaka is shaped like whale...

1183
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,875
Lake Ahino is...

1184
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,000
I get it, Mr. Mouri.

1185
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,458
The next murder site

1186
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,667
is going to be
the tip of the nose of the Asshee!

1187
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,667
not too fast, Inspector Yokomizo.

1188
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,542
You're lead to think so,

1189
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,500
but it's actually here!

1190
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,250
I see! Where the eye is!!...

1191
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,583
Annaka City in Gunma Prefecture.

1192
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,417
I know Annaka very well.

1193
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,000
I'll go to the site to. Take me there!!

1194
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,083
Yes, sir!!

1195
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,292
I'll go too...

1196
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:13,083
Wha?

1197
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,375
W, What do you think you're doing!!

1198
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:16,667
Don't go...

1199
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:19,083
But, only two people
to face a vicious killer isn't...

1200
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,625
Two's enough...

1201
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:26,917
It sure was fun.

1202
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:29,875
Yes, Conan should've come too.

1203
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:33,333
Hey, don't you think that
Conan's not quite himself recently?

1204
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,917
He went home all be himself today too

1205
01:02:35,917 --> 01:02:38,500
I'm sure he hasn't
recovered fully from his cold yet...

1206
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,083
Remember, he was absent for two days.

1207
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,708
Here comes the bus!

1208
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,500
It's a beetle!

1209
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,125
This bus came from Beika Forest.

1210
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,333
I see...

1211
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,750
It got on grandpa's shoulder
when he was walking through the forest

1212
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,958
and came on the bus together...

1213
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:03,458
Oh...

1214
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,542
It's the tape of the convenience store.

1215
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:07,125
Not again...

1216
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:09,667
There were other beetles
that were tampered with too...

1217
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,125
Poor thing.

1218
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,875
No good. It's stuck on good and hard...

1219
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,625
Let's have Dr. Agasa peel it off again.

1220
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,208
And let's have him give us something
to eat too while we're at it.

1221
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,458
Kazuki,

1222
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,875
there was only one bunch of flowers
sent by an anonymous person... today...

1223
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,083
That's right.

1224
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,250
Hello...

1225
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:03,917
You're Detective Mouri's assistant...
Is it true?

1226
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:09,792
So, I'm looking for Mr. Mizutani because of
a certain case I'm investigating...

1227
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,917
but it seems he didn't come
to the memorial service.

1228
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:14,625
No... he did come early this morning

1229
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,333
and left after leaving
just some flowers behind.

1230
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,625
Only some flowers behind?...

1231
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:25,250
My parents still haven't forgiven him for
eloping with my younger sister, you see...

1232
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:26,917
That's why...

1233
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:30,375
So, the flowers that were sent here
by an anonymous sender was...

1234
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,042
from Mr. Mizutani?...

1235
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,917
She was saying there was only one today,

1236
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:36,208
does that mean that you got
several other such flowers?...

1237
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,458
Yes... from people other than him...

1238
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:41,250
Do you know when and where
they were delivered from?

1239
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,292
Yes, I do...

1240
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:44,417
Uh...

1241
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:46,958
we got four during the funeral
the year before last...

1242
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,833
from the cities of Matsumoto, Kawasaki

1243
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,875
Numazu and Kamakura.

1244
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:53,667
Three during
the first year memorial last year...

1245
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,750
The flowers came from Tokorozawa, Odawara

1246
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,042
and Hachioji...

1247
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,125
All seven are addresses of the victims...

1248
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,750
In fact, when I saw Kosuke this morning...

1249
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,708
he said something strange...

1250
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,125
Something strange?

1251
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,375
"There're 8 people I can't forgive... "

1252
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:12,292
"There's still one more person left."

1253
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:17,875
Hmm... This is...

1254
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,917
It's the doings of the same culprit...

1255
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,958
The tape is stuck on in the same V-shape...

1256
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:28,375
I see... this could be somebody's message!

1257
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,833
Message?!

1258
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:33,333
Now, can you tell what the message is?

1259
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:35,750
Hmm

1260
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:40,750
The answer is "help", "SOS".

1261
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,208
Huh?

1262
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,167
How come?

1263
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,333
Because of the beetle...

1264
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,208
My car, the Volkswagen, because of its shape
that resembles the beetle

1265
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:52,417
is also called Beetle...

1266
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:53,750
Another thing is,

1267
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,000
the word "beetle" was combined
with the word "beat" used in music,

1268
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,792
and a famous pop group
was named after the word.

1269
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:03,417
You mean... "the Beatles"?

1270
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,250
Their 1st album was titled

1271
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,083
"Please, Please Me."

1272
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:10,958
Their 2nd "With the Beatles."

1273
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:14,083
The 3rd, "A Hard Days Night",

1274
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:17,000
the 4th "Beatles for Sale",

1275
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,750
and their 5th "Help".

1276
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,250
How about it? Now do you understand?

1277
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,917
What's the Beatles?

1278
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:29,042
I think it's a foreign music band.

1279
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:32,083
You mean, you don't know the Beatles?...

1280
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:33,917
Nope... I don't either... Don't know them

1281
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:36,917
Come to think of it, big sis
used to listen to them sometimes...

1282
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,792
Because she used to like oldies...

1283
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:42,125
O... Oldies...

1284
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,375
I would rather have you dish out food for us
than give out a quiz...

1285
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,167
"Help"...

1286
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:54,750
that means someone's seeking help...

1287
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,083
I see...

1288
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,833
It's show time
for the Youth Detective Squad!

1289
01:06:58,833 --> 01:06:59,833
Yep!

1290
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:04,625
I've figured it out,
the meaning of "Tanabata Kyoto"

1291
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,625
The seven victims stayed at the hotel?!

1292
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:12,000
The victim of the fire was
a young lady called Nanako Honjo.

1293
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,958
Her lover, a man called Kosuke Mizutani,

1294
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:18,292
seems to have come a year ago
asking about the fire...

1295
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,542
And 2 hours ago,

1296
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:22,083
Heiji Hattori seems to have come asking

1297
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,417
about the same case.

1298
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,500
Yeah, that's right...
I got sort of interested in the case...

1299
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,208
Oh, right, Inspector.

1300
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,917
I'll tell you something good...

1301
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:35,375
The Mahjong tiles symbolize the elevator...

1302
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:36,500
Elevator?

1303
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,625
Ouch, ow...

1304
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:45,083
There were 9 guests spending the night
on the 6th floor of the hotel

1305
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,792
Aside from Nanako who died in the fire
and Mizutani himself,

1306
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:51,875
7 people have already been killed...

1307
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,625
Who's the last one left...

1308
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,083
I know...

1309
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,125
This is water to wash your hands with,
right?

1310
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,000
Right! Wow, so you know.

1311
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,833
But, I don't know how to actually use it.

1312
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,708
Oh... I'll show you then...

1313
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:07,792
Ready?

1314
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:20,167
What?! Position of the stars?

1315
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:22,333
Yeah... The seven murder sites

1316
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,750
indicated the position of the six stars

1317
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,917
of the Polar Star and the Big Dipper

1318
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:27,875
Wait a minute.

1319
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,917
True... this more than resembles it...

1320
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:41,250
When you match it over
the actual picture of the stars,

1321
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,667
it's almost a perfect match...

1322
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,583
What a diligent person.

1323
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:48,917
Likewise,
all the Mahjong tiles and the alphabets

1324
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,292
indicated the Polar Star and Big Dipper.

1325
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,042
The 1 and 7 of circles

1326
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:57,417
formed the shape of
the Polar Star and Big Dipper.

1327
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:01,750
The alphabets were
the Greek names given to each star,

1328
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:07,208
that is, Alpha, Beta, Gamma,
Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta...

1329
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,500
And? Ai...

1330
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,208
The last of the Big Dipper,

1331
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,750
the position of Merak, right?

1332
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,833
I'll get it right away...

1333
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:14,583
Do that, will you.

1334
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:15,917
Here it is...

1335
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:18,792
Around Shiba Park, in the Minato ward.

1336
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:20,958
I'm sure

1337
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:23,083
(Beikachou Forest)
there's a person who's calling for help

1338
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,375
near the trees where
we found the beetles the other day!

1339
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,917
We've got to go help!

1340
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:27,583
Yes.

1341
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,042
Youth Detective Squad,

1342
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,500
Let's go!!

1343
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,750
If it's about Nanako and Mr. Mizutani,

1344
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,000
about 2 hours ago

1345
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,417
a boy wearing glasses came
to ask questions about them.

1346
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,333
A boy wearing glasses?

1347
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,292
Yes... he said he was
Detective Mouri's assistant...

1348
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,958
Then this is what Mr. Mizutain said?

1349
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:55,208
"There are 8 people I can't forgive...

1350
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:57,125
There's still one more person left."...

1351
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:58,333
Yes...

1352
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:01,667
What happened...
Did Mr. Mizutani do something...

1353
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:03,458
No, it's not that...

1354
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:04,625
What?!

1355
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,792
Which means the killer
intends to murder another person?!...

1356
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,417
Yes, most probably...

1357
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:12,333
And, Conan seems to have come here too...

1358
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,750
Conan did?!

1359
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:16,292
No...

1360
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:20,917
I would never ask a brat like him
to do something like that...

1361
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:23,250
Then, who on earth...

1362
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,083
It could be Kudo...

1363
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:28,167
Superintendent...
isn't Kosuke Mizutani the killer...

1364
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:31,458
Yeah... there's probably no doubt about it...

1365
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:34,083
But, who's the remaining person...

1366
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:36,625
and where's the next murder site
going to be...

1367
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,708
Nana...

1368
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,500
Kosuke

1369
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,042
Once more...

1370
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:58,250
Uh, can I try once more?

1371
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,792
This is so much fun

1372
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,958
After all, it's the first time
I'm taking a trip with you,

1373
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,250
Kosuke.

1374
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,417
Nana!! Nana!!

1375
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:16,875
Let me go! Nana's inside!!

1376
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,875
Nana!! Nana!!

1377
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:22,458
Nana...

1378
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,667
Okay.

1379
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:31,625
I'll go look around where they may be...

1380
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,667
Goodbye...

1381
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,625
Mitsuhiko isn't home yet?

1382
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,833
Hmm... It's already 7:00 pm

1383
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,042
and where did those three go...

1384
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:42,292
They're not answering
their detective badges either...

1385
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:45,875
Doc, maybe the children...

1386
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:54,917
Yes...

1387
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,417
Oh, Mr. Sawamura?

1388
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,125
Huh? The thing that Mr. Mizutani and Nanako
were interested in?

1389
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:03,458
Yep... maybe something like star gazing?

1390
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,542
Right...

1391
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:08,333
They did say that they decided to live here
because it's near an observatory...

1392
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,333
Just as I thought...

1393
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,542
Among all the stars

1394
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:13,917
they liked the Polar Star
and the Big Dipper most of all...

1395
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,542
They liked the beautiful shape
of the Big Dipper

1396
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,750
and the Polar Star for it is always
shining brightly facing the northeast...

1397
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:27,167
I think they were reconfirming their love

1398
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:29,708
for each other by watching those stars...

1399
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,375
What am I doing talking about something
like this to a child like you

1400
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,750
who's not ready to understand yet...

1401
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,708
Thank you...

1402
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:40,417
The place that's closest to the stars
in this area is...

1403
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,375
Good evening

1404
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,667
I am at the Tohto Tower

1405
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:52,583
where a Tanabata Fair
is being held right now.

1406
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,417
The weather unfortunately is not the best,

1407
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:57,125
but tonight is the last night
of the Tanabata Fair.

1408
01:12:57,125 --> 01:13:01,000
People dressed in Yukatas
are coming in one after the other.

1409
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,167
Now, here's the weather forecast
for tonight and tomorrow.

1410
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:06,083
-it will begin raining
-In the Tokyo area,

1411
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,417
from a little after 10:00…

1412
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,458
There may be thunder and lightning
in some areas...

1413
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,417
Excuse me!

1414
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,708
What is it, sonny?...

1415
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,875
Could you keep this for me?

1416
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:21,792
Huh?...

1417
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:23,750
Sure... But, are you alone...?

1418
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,458
Well, while I was in the bathroom,

1419
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,708
my father and younger brother
went on ahead without me...

1420
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,083
How dare they.

1421
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,708
Your Yukata is pretty.

1422
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,250
Yours is cute too.

1423
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,958
Hey, why don't all four of us
take a picture together!

1424
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:46,792
Let's take a lot of pictures, a lot!

1425
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:48,292
Okay! here goes!

1426
01:13:48,292 --> 01:13:49,792
Cheese!

1427
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,667
Did we go by this road before?

1428
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:13,208
The road... maybe we took the wrong road?...

1429
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:16,000
I'm hungry... let's go home...

1430
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,875
No... we've got to find the person ourselves.

1431
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:19,875
Right...

1432
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:24,167
don't you want to try and solve a case
without Conan at least once...

1433
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,083
I do.

1434
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:29,792
But... there aren't any
sawtooth oak trees around...

1435
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,750
Oh, that's right!

1436
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,125
Let's have this beetle guide the way...

1437
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:40,208
Beetles usually fly to the tree
that gives out the same sap...

1438
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:45,250
That way...

1439
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:48,167
Do we have to run?

1440
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:53,583
As a result of investigation,
we've found out who the suspect is,

1441
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:57,125
and that he may go on
to kill another person...

1442
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,583
But, we don't know where the suspect is,

1443
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,375
neither do we know
where the crime is going to be committed...

1444
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,333
Does anyone have any ideas?

1445
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:09,542
Darn...

1446
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,500
while we're here doing this,

1447
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,208
I'm sure that...
Maybe someone is being killed...

1448
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:25,917
All right, it's an oak tree.

1449
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,792
Huh?... There's another one...

1450
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,667
Maybe there'll be tape on it again...

1451
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:36,125
J... Just a bit more...

1452
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:39,750
There!...
There's tape on it too... after all...

1453
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,875
I'm sure it's over there!

1454
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,667
The person who's asking for help
has got to be there!!

1455
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:55,292
Yeah! But there's something eerie about it...

1456
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:57,333
Yep, it looks haunted...

1457
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,167
D, Don't say things like that please.

1458
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:07,500
It sure is nice and the stars are beautiful
all the way up here...

1459
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,417
That's the Polar Star...

1460
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,583
And, that's the Big Dipper...

1461
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:12,583
Yeah...

1462
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,542
Huh?... That shape...

1463
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:18,542
sure looks familiar...

1464
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,042
What? What?

1465
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:24,167
The Polar Star and the Big Dipper?!

1466
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:25,292
Ouch, ow...

1467
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,708
So, you're saying that the next murder site

1468
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,833
is indicated by
the Polar Star and Big Dipper!!

1469
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:32,333
There's no doubt about it, Inspector!

1470
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:35,125
Oh, you're the officer
I talked to you a while ago...

1471
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:35,958
Yes...

1472
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,833
Then, Mr. Mizutaini and Ms. Honjo
used to like star gazing...

1473
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:41,625
Thank you...

1474
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:42,875
Superintendent!

1475
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:45,708
The place that matches the position
of the remaining stars

1476
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:47,750
of the Big Dipper is Shiba Park!

1477
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,750
Okay!

1478
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,417
Megure, put out an emergency search
for Kosuke Mizutain right now

1479
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,875
and wait here!

1480
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:55,542
All the others head for Shiba Park!
On the double!!

1481
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:56,333
Yes, sir!!

1482
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,750
Ah, gee...

1483
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,875
Don't scare us like that...

1484
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,917
What do you mean, "Ah, gee"...

1485
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,958
You shouldn't be out playing around
like this at this time of day.

1486
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:10,083
We weren't playing around!

1487
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,625
We came to help someone!

1488
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:14,333
The person that used the beetles
to ask for help!

1489
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,458
At any rate, it's time to go home.

1490
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:17,583
Your parents are worried about you.

1491
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,625
It's still early...

1492
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,875
We can all go home after they answer
the plea that message indicates,

1493
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:24,042
don't you think?

1494
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,208
Thank you very much.

1495
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,375
Thank you very much...

1496
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,417
Oh...

1497
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:48,375
I'll get it.

1498
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:51,042
Thanks... I'd appreciate it.

1499
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,458
Yes, this is officer Takagi's cell phone.

1500
01:17:56,333 --> 01:18:00,208
Oh, Dr. Agasa.
His hands are tied right now...

1501
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,542
I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're busy,

1502
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,375
but could you please
tell him this please...?

1503
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,667
Well, this is a weird story you see...

1504
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,250
Beatles?...

1505
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,708
It can't be...

1506
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,167
I got you. We'll be right over!

1507
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:16,208
You and the others hide somewhere safe, Doc!

1508
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:17,792
Officer Takagi,

1509
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:19,083
head for Beika Forest, will you.

1510
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:20,625
No, but...

1511
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:23,458
Don't worry...
I'll take full responsibility!

1512
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:28,250
All right, I'll take full responsibility!

1513
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:31,417
H, Hey, which way?

1514
01:18:31,417 --> 01:18:33,292
Huh? Oh... I don't get it!!

1515
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:37,917
To the left.

1516
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:38,708
Okay.

1517
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,125
(Kogoro Mori detective agency)
What?! Conan was on TV?!...

1518
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:50,792
Yeah... I saw him
walk into the Tohto Tower alone.

1519
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,417
I think it was around 20:00...

1520
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:53,792
I see...

1521
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:56,875
Well, I'm sure you don't have to worry
and he'll be back soon...

1522
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:00,083
But... his cell phone is switched off too...

1523
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,042
No good... Superintendent...

1524
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,500
Neither Takagi nor Sato is answering.

1525
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,333
Never mind them!

1526
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,333
Okay!

1527
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:16,208
I'm sure Mizutani
is hiding in this vicinity!

1528
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,542
Split up and nab him
as soon as you find him!!

1529
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:19,417
Yes, sir!!

1530
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,708
It's not visible because it's cloudy...

1531
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,292
The star that Nanako and you liked...

1532
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:49,583
The Polar Star and Big Dipper...

1533
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:51,542
Sonny...

1534
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,042
Oh, this customer...

1535
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,208
Did you see him?

1536
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,375
Yes, he kept asking me
what time we close over

1537
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,000
and over so I remember him.

1538
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,500
If I'm not mistaken

1539
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,125
he went up to the observatory alone
at around 19:00.

1540
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,417
Oh!

1541
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:11,083
You're Detective Mouri's assistant...

1542
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,042
Sort of...

1543
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,083
But, it's too bad

1544
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,375
that despite coming to a place
so near the stars,

1545
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,208
there are no stars to see.

1546
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:22,375
No... They're visible in my eyes.

1547
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:28,500
No matter where and when

1548
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,292
those stars are always visible to me...

1549
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,042
What?! The observatory?!

1550
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,958
Yes, this woman says she saw him.

1551
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,833
Did you see him leave?

1552
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,500
No, I didn't...

1553
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:46,500
Okay! There's no doubt that the suspect
is in the Grand Observatory!

1554
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,208
I'm sure he's summoned someone there

1555
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,125
and is getting ready
to commit his final murder!

1556
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:54,125
We're going in now
and taking custody of the suspect

1557
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,750
as well as shelter the hostage!

1558
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,792
The suspect is most probably armed

1559
01:20:58,792 --> 01:20:59,958
so take great care!

1560
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:03,625
Please leave the lights inside as is.

1561
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,792
Yes, sir!

1562
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,417
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

1563
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,625
Uh, Mr. Mizutani...

1564
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:15,042
After you finish drinking that wine,

1565
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,208
you're planning to die, right?

1566
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:20,292
"There are 8 people I cannot forgive... "

1567
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,542
"there is one more person left... "

1568
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:24,417
The remaining one person

1569
01:21:24,417 --> 01:21:26,792
is you yourself, right... Mr. Mizutani.

1570
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,042
W, What the?!

1571
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,333
I think I can understand

1572
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:46,208
how surprised and angry
you were to the point of trembling

1573
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,250
when you heard of how Nanako passed away...

1574
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:51,250
That's why you went to the hotel in Kyoto

1575
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,333
to check things out, right?

1576
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:57,333
You're absolutely right...

1577
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,542
On that day, 2 years ago,

1578
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,125
if I didn't go to see my friend,

1579
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,292
Nanako wouldn't have had to die...

1580
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:09,375
When I think about it,
I just can't forgive myself...

1581
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,500
But killing yourself's not right!

1582
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,333
Suicide is killing yourself,

1583
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,292
you know...

1584
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,333
I know... I know,

1585
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,917
but... I can't bear to live in world

1586
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,083
where Nana is no more...

1587
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:25,167
Besides...

1588
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,875
I'm going to be sentenced to death anyway...

1589
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,333
No you won't...

1590
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,208
Because you didn't kill anybody
Mr. Mizutani...

1591
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,917
There was a person who came to you
and asked you to kill yourself

1592
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:40,417
since you yourself being as kind as you are,

1593
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:44,542
couldn't make yourself kill those 7 people,
right?

1594
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:48,875
Since you felt responsible
for Nanako's death,

1595
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,917
you didn't think of disagreeing...

1596
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:52,042
But,

1597
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:56,000
the person that,
that man really hated and wanted to kill

1598
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,750
was actually you, Mr. Mizutani!

1599
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,708
Because you, Mr. Mizutani,

1600
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:04,583
were the one who took his
beloved younger sister away from him...

1601
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,417
Isn't that right...

1602
01:23:07,042 --> 01:23:09,333
Nanako's older brother

1603
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,750
Mr. Kazuki Honjo!

1604
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,875
B, Big brother, what bring you here...

1605
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:18,708
Don't lecture me!

1606
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,125
Brat... How'd you figure out I did it...

1607
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,708
I just couldn't understand...
No matter how much I thought about it...

1608
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:32,333
If Mr. Mizutani were the killer,
I just couldn't understand the psyche behind

1609
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:35,750
why he chose the position of the Polar Star
and Big Dipper to indicate the murder site...

1610
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,208
Because it would be like throwing dirt
onto the stars that he liked, right?

1611
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,625
So, I deduced that maybe someone else

1612
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:46,500
schemed the entire murder taking advantage
of the fact that Mr. Mizutani liked stars,

1613
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,208
and to frame him as the murderer...

1614
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:52,250
Once I realized this, I was convinced...

1615
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,833
Besides, the killer accurately
set the coordinates of the Polar Star

1616
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,750
and Big Dipper on the map,

1617
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,333
and was a person meticulous enough
to set that place up as the murder site...

1618
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:06,542
On the contrary, the name plate at
Mr. Mizutani's apartment was slightly crooked

1619
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,667
and his handwriting
wasn't all that nice either...

1620
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,458
The telephone number

1621
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:13,083
written on Mr. Honjo's name card

1622
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,792
was beautifully written

1623
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:16,958
and a light line was drawn

1624
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,083
so that the handwriting
wouldn't go crooked...

1625
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:21,125
Even in your notebook, Mr. Honjo,

1626
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,292
you had the names and addresses
of the people that had sent flowers

1627
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,000
neatly written out in a small space.

1628
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:29,208
This means that you're
a very meticulous person, doesn't it?

1629
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,083
Who the hell are you anyway...

1630
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:35,167
Conan Edogawa...

1631
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:36,458
a detective...

1632
01:24:41,292 --> 01:24:42,458
It's been a hard day...

1633
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,292
Dr. Agasa... where are the other children?

1634
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,375
I took them home to their parents...

1635
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,917
Let me take you there.

1636
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,125
Please do.

1637
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:57,708
You wait in the car, Ai.

1638
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:05,042
You're the one who called Mr. Mizutani
about Nanako's death, right?

1639
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:06,042
Yeah...

1640
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:09,000
I heard from him
that Sumire Shindo the artist

1641
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
was staying at the same hotel
on the same floor that day...

1642
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:14,833
(Art Exhibition)
I went to Sumire's exhibition

1643
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,875
(Art Exhibition)
wanting to talk to her...

1644
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,708
Back then, I coincidentally heard and

1645
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:22,583
eavesdropped Sumire and Ryuzaki
talking to each other...

1646
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,375
So, you went ahead
and told Mr. Mizutani about it...

1647
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,750
Including a bit of your lies too...

1648
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:30,875
He told you that the flowers that
arrived on Nanako's first memorial service

1649
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:35,458
were sent by the seven people who were
staying on the sixth floor that day.

1650
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:39,417
If it were just one or two people
they could've sent it of goodwill,

1651
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:41,667
but all seven of them doing so,

1652
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:45,000
can be taken as nothing more than
their feeling of appreciation.

1653
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,917
In appreciation for Nanako
getting off the elevator

1654
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:50,625
and making way for all of them...

1655
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:54,792
Then, don't tell me that Nanako wasn't
forced off the elevator,

1656
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:56,250
but rather, got off of her own initiative...

1657
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,958
Yeah, right,

1658
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,417
because Nanako was a kind person...

1659
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,875
But!

1660
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,500
Even if she got off on her own,

1661
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,208
it makes no difference that
she died because they got on!

1662
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,000
Mr. Mizutani...

1663
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,500
It's true that Nanako's died as a result
of saving the 7 people...

1664
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,667
But... She sacrificing her life

1665
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:23,917
compared to you taking on Mr. Honjo's crime

1666
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,917
and killing yourself
sacrificing your own life

1667
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:28,000
is as different as heaven and hell.

1668
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:31,792
It so different
as a star glittering in the sky

1669
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:34,833
to a stone rolling on the ground!

1670
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:44,125
Nana...

1671
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,833
-I'm not going to do it...
-What?!

1672
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:52,250
I'm sorry, but I've decided not to die...

1673
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:55,417
This boy woke me up.

1674
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,542
Mizutani...

1675
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,833
I'm sure that Nana who's in heaven

1676
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:05,125
doesn't want me to commit suicide either...

1677
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,750
I'll give this back to you.

1678
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,708
I don't need it anymore.

1679
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,333
Please turn yourself in... big brother...

1680
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,333
Damn...

1681
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:15,875
Mr. Honjo...

1682
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:19,667
Those are things that you stole
from the 7 victims, right...?

1683
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:22,583
You gave it to Mr. Mizutani saying that
if he died with that on him

1684
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:25,500
it would be proof
that he's the killer, right.

1685
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,667
I'm glad I came after all...

1686
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:32,167
I heard that Detective Mouri
was investigating the case,

1687
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,833
so I was worried that things
would be exposed and came...

1688
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,708
I lied to you expecting

1689
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:41,083
that you would avenge
my younger sister's death,

1690
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:44,000
but you didn't have the courage to do it...

1691
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,958
That's why I took it upon myself
to kill them.

1692
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:47,875
That's not courage!

1693
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:49,167
It's nothing more than
gratifying your own needs!

1694
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:50,125
Shut up!!!

1695
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,167
I guess you came here alone

1696
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,917
because I don't see Detective Mouri around!

1697
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:55,708
How dare you make light of me!!

1698
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:04,083
We made it in time...

1699
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:07,667
I'm Matsumoto from
the Metropolitan Police Department...

1700
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,083
M, Metropolitan Police Department...?

1701
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:11,583
Are you hurt?

1702
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,500
Oh, no...

1703
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,167
You're coming with me to the station...

1704
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:22,917
Shoots!!

1705
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:25,458
Damn...

1706
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:27,042
I'm not getting caught...

1707
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,625
Just as I thought...

1708
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:39,708
you were Irish after all!!

1709
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:47,500
-Police!!
-Freeze!

1710
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,333
Just as I thought!!

1711
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,417
Superintendent!!

1712
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:53,375
S, Superintendent?!

1713
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,208
Please get a hold of yourself!!

1714
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,625
Superintendent?!

1715
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,417
Why is he in a place like this?

1716
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,583
That Superintendent Matsumoto's
an imposter...

1717
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:05,625
He switched...

1718
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,083
Superintendent lived in the age
when the Beatles were popular...

1719
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,792
I couldn't believe it but...

1720
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,208
Contact Inspector Megure...

1721
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:14,667
Okay.

1722
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:22,083
It's me. What's up?...

1723
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:25,750
They've found out... that he's an imposter...

1724
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:27,708
Okay...

1725
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,083
Belmot...

1726
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,167
Huh? He did come here?

1727
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:00,000
Yes,

1728
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,833
he left his skateboard here

1729
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:05,042
but didn't come to get it
so I was wondering about him.

1730
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,667
Don't tell me he's still in there.

1731
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:09,833
No way.

1732
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,083
If he still is, that's bad news.

1733
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,500
He'll come face to face with the killer.

1734
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,667
K, Killer?!

1735
01:30:15,667 --> 01:30:18,458
The police are inside investigating now.

1736
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:19,958
Sonoko, wait here!

1737
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:21,333
H, Hey, Ran?!

1738
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,500
You!! Wait up!!

1739
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,583
What did you do
with Superintendent Matsumoto?

1740
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:31,750
Don't tell me that you...

1741
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:34,542
No, he's still alive...

1742
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:39,167
I've got to have him take my place
as the killer you see...

1743
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:44,708
Is that the memory card
with the NOC list of the Organization...

1744
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:46,417
Yeah, sort of...

1745
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:50,500
When did you figure out I was an imposter?

1746
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:53,958
I sort of had an idea...

1747
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:56,417
that you weren't
the master of disguise Belmot

1748
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,250
and that someone else had snuck in

1749
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,542
because your physique
is too different from hers,

1750
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:02,958
and it was impossible for her
to disguise herself as the Superintendent...

1751
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,500
As a result,
you become the number one candidate...

1752
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:08,542
I see...

1753
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:11,667
Just as would be expected of you...
Shinichi Kudo...

1754
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,125
I wasn't really all for it

1755
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,542
until I saw the fingerprints match though.

1756
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,917
Did you report this to your boss?

1757
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:22,000
No, not yet...

1758
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,750
I haven't told anybody yet.

1759
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:27,250
Not even to Gin?

1760
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,292
No...

1761
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:30,208
Shinichi Kudo...

1762
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,583
Have you forgotten...

1763
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:37,375
I don't remember the name of each
and every person I killed...

1764
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,583
What about him?

1765
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,792
No... it's nothing.

1766
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,792
Phooey... just concentrate on your mission,
will you.

1767
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:50,792
Why...

1768
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,625
Some time ago that guy...

1769
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:57,667
on top of shooting a member
of the Organization who goofed

1770
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:01,458
left the corpse of that man to burn to ashes

1771
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:03,208
in the burning inferno of Haido City Hotel...

1772
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:12,958
That member was a man that I respected
and depended on like a father.

1773
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,125
Haido City Hotel...

1774
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:20,250
Pisco?!

1775
01:32:22,958 --> 01:32:25,958
You've checked everything out on us too,
I see...

1776
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,417
His greatest mistake

1777
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:31,208
was failing to kill Shinichi Kudo,

1778
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,292
on top of not being able
to expose his identity...

1779
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm taking you to that person myself...

1780
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,958
as witness

1781
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:43,333
to put that
snobbish cold blooded bastard away.

1782
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:47,542
Only this man's knows my identity...

1783
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:49,625
All I have to do is knock him down...

1784
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,375
But,
I can't use my tranquilizer gun already...

1785
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:54,583
The only thing I can do is...

1786
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:03,333
Don't worry, I won't kill you...

1787
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,292
I'm just going to knock you out
for a while...

1788
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:09,500
I've got to take you to that person alive

1789
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,958
or he won't believe

1790
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,500
that you're Shinichi Kudo...

1791
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,250
T, This is...

1792
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:26,083
Officer Chiba?!

1793
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,333
Officer Chiba, are you all right?!

1794
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:35,167
I think he's just passed out...

1795
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:37,333
I think the same goes
for the rest of the people too...

1796
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:39,708
Conan?!

1797
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:41,708
Hey, you?!

1798
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,833
You! Wait up.

1799
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:51,333
Conan...

1800
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:55,375
Conan! Are you all right?!

1801
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:57,375
Ran... big sis...

1802
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,542
Conan!

1803
01:33:58,542 --> 01:33:59,667
Are you both okay?

1804
01:34:01,042 --> 01:34:02,250
Superintendent Matsumoto!

1805
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:03,917
Superintendent!

1806
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:05,917
The other officers downstairs are...

1807
01:34:05,917 --> 01:34:08,833
Yeah... they were attacked by the culprit...

1808
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:11,917
No...

1809
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,708
Get out of...

1810
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:16,375
What? What's the matter?

1811
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:19,042
Run for it... That guy's...

1812
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:20,042
Huh?

1813
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:30,292
You're not... Superintendent Matsumoto...

1814
01:34:31,042 --> 01:34:32,167
Phooey...

1815
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,333
No...

1816
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:39,625
I'll be fine...

1817
01:34:40,917 --> 01:34:42,375
I can't take on rifles

1818
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,792
like Kyogyoku,

1819
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,708
but if a shotgun...

1820
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,417
Hey, Ran do you know?

1821
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:50,583
The speed of a bullet from a rifle

1822
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:53,292
goes at 1000 meters per second.

1823
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:54,500
On the contrary,

1824
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,792
a bullet from a shotgun
goes at only one-third of that,

1825
01:34:56,792 --> 01:35:00,167
at 350 meters per second!

1826
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:04,417
What's so funny...

1827
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:07,708
Don't tell me you think
you can dodge my bullet?

1828
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,042
Exactly.

1829
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,083
Very interesting...

1830
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:12,417
Try it...

1831
01:35:33,042 --> 01:35:34,458
Wow...

1832
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:37,500
You're pretty good, sweetie.

1833
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,792
It slipped my mind...

1834
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:43,667
that you, sweetie... are a master of Karate!!

1835
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:15,500
Ran!

1836
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,583
How dare you waste my time...

1837
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:28,500
Ran, stay down!

1838
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:32,875
Leave the rest to me and you stay still!

1839
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:34,417
Damn!

1840
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:49,333
Run! Run!

1841
01:36:53,292 --> 01:36:55,250
Let me enjoy this even more...

1842
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:19,875
Damn!

1843
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:26,333
Too bad! You almost made it!!

1844
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:36,125
Kugh! What's the matter? Is that it?

1845
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,375
Okay, keep that up. Hang in there!

1846
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:57,750
It's about time we end this game of chase...

1847
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:09,917
I guess the situation's reversed...

1848
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,292
Damn...

1849
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:15,250
Okay, give me the memory card.

1850
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:22,292
Here they come...

1851
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:34,958
The situation's reversed...

1852
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:44,167
It's me...

1853
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:46,042
How're things...

1854
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:47,958
Did you get a hold of the memory card...

1855
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,083
Yeah...

1856
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,500
I can't see it too clearly...

1857
01:38:58,958 --> 01:39:00,708
Stick it out more in front.

1858
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:06,208
Right... More in front.

1859
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:09,375
Fire.

1860
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:18,542
Bingo.

1861
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:21,250
I wanted to shoot him...

1862
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:23,125
Boss...

1863
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,667
Look below.

1864
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,333
Huh?

1865
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:29,042
That's... He can't flee already...

1866
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:32,333
Good work... Irish...

1867
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:37,292
There's one more...

1868
01:39:39,292 --> 01:39:41,875
Hey! Get a hold of yourself! Hey!!

1869
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:47,792
You'll be fine.
They've missed the vital point.

1870
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:49,125
So long as we can get you treated as soon as

1871
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:50,667
they're taken care of...

1872
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,667
I get the picture...

1873
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:57,708
No wonder Belmot fell for you...

1874
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:59,250
Don't talk!

1875
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,833
Once I get your wound treated,

1876
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:02,458
you better be ready

1877
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,458
cause you're spitting out
the identity of your boss!

1878
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,750
Irish!!

1879
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:18,875
Shinichi Kudo...
keep pursuing them... forever...

1880
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,958
Irish!!

1881
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,958
He used Irish as a shield!!

1882
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:26,417
We can't afford to let him get down.

1883
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,083
Use the you know what.

1884
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:28,917
Roger.

1885
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:34,083
Damn!!

1886
01:40:50,792 --> 01:40:52,542
No good, Ran's below...

1887
01:40:59,542 --> 01:41:01,083
There he is, keep it up!

1888
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,125
Boss... what shall we do?

1889
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,125
Chianti, smoke him out.

1890
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,042
Okay

1891
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,625
Darn... What now...

1892
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:47,292
Tear gas?!

1893
01:41:50,542 --> 01:41:54,042
Here he comes... Corner him all the way up!

1894
01:42:17,792 --> 01:42:20,667
Phooey... we've cornered the mouse...

1895
01:42:20,917 --> 01:42:23,208
From above... Aim at him from above!

1896
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:25,167
There'll be no blind spot.

1897
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:26,042
Roger.

1898
01:42:33,042 --> 01:42:33,875
Damn!

1899
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:34,875
What now...

1900
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:36,875
If I keep this up, I'm a rat in a trap...

1901
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:42,000
Darn... What now...

1902
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:07,125
Now, let's see what he looks like...

1903
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:21,250
H, He jumped off!

1904
01:43:22,292 --> 01:43:24,292
He gave up thinking he couldn't flee.

1905
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,542
Go for it!!

1906
01:43:48,583 --> 01:43:49,750
We've been hit...

1907
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,542
Hey, what the hell's going on?!

1908
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:53,625
It, It's out of control!!

1909
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,500
We've got no choice... retreat...

1910
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,333
Roger.

1911
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,792
What the...

1912
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,458
Who the hell is he...

1913
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,917
Just as expected of Silver Bullet.

1914
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,083
He's pretty good...

1915
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:38,917
And suddenly there was a loud bang...

1916
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:41,625
Well...I'm embarassed...

1917
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,333
We're lucky no one was injured.

1918
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:44,333
I'm sorry!

1919
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:46,750
Okay, Ran,

1920
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:49,833
I think we'll be asking you
for the details at a later date,

1921
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:51,292
so when the time comes,
please help us, all right?

1922
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:52,250
Okay.

1923
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,667
They'll be dispatching a car

1924
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:56,333
to take you home so wait a while longer,
okay?

1925
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:57,792
Thank you very much.

1926
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,500
Are you really okay?

1927
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,375
Yep.

1928
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:04,333
Right, I'll go get us some drinks.

1929
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,917
Oh, don't worry about it...

1930
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:07,250
No problem at all...

1931
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:08,875
Thanks...

1932
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:10,542
Ran.

1933
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,417
Everything's okay now.

1934
01:45:13,417 --> 01:45:16,333
Shinichi said that...

1935
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,583
Oh, now that you mentioned it, Shinichi...

1936
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:20,208
Oh, well you see,

1937
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:22,125
He said
he had to go attend to another case...

1938
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:25,125
What! He left on his own again

1939
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:27,208
Yep... And...

1940
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:29,875
I'll bet he left saying,
"Don't tell anybody about me"

1941
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:31,750
or something like that, right?

1942
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,750
Oh, right,

1943
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,708
he says you can call him...

1944
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:40,042
I "can" call him?

1945
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:43,208
Oh, rather...
he was saying to please call him,

1946
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:44,208
I think it was...

1947
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:49,417
Well, I guess it's forgivable that
I got to at least hear his voice...

1948
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,792
Besides...

1949
01:45:51,792 --> 01:45:53,167
Talking of voices...

1950
01:45:53,167 --> 01:45:56,708
after all, there are people...
who only get to see each other once a year...

1951
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:55,250
It seems that no dead bodies were found

1952
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:57,333
in the helicopter that crashed.

1953
01:49:57,333 --> 01:49:58,333
Yeah...

1954
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:01,208
I'll bet they all escaped
just before the explosion...

1955
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:05,542
AI... So, Irish's identity remains unknown...

1956
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:09,250
I'll bet the police have nothing on him, too

1957
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,250
I can't tell them anything
about him either...

1958
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,792
But,

1959
01:50:14,792 --> 01:50:16,417
it's horrifying to think that

1960
01:50:16,417 --> 01:50:18,958
he was being confined for 10 days
in a place like this...

1961
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:21,792
It seems that Superintendent Matsumoto
didn't see the face

1962
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:23,167
of the one who abducted him either...

1963
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,625
Either way, thanks to the children,

1964
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:28,208
he was safely rescued.

1965
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,375
Yeah...

1966
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:32,833
After all, Irish died before he could tell

1967
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:34,000
where the place of confinement was...

1968
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:38,833
Irish...

1969
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:42,250
Shinichi Kudo...

1970
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,750
Keep pursuing them... forever...

1971
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:48,917
I sure will keep pursuing them...

1972
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,958
Until I crush those guys to a pulp!!
