On the hills of Mimuro,
where the tempests blow.

5
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:49,642
Autumn leaves form a woven brocade flowing

(on the waters of Tatsuta River.)
The same trump card as Master...

7
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,892
It is all thanks to you...

8
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,267
Ooka Momiji.

9
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:14,892
After today's TV recording,

10
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:17,309
I must extend my gratitude to you.

11
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:21,809
What? So early?

12
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:23,601
You're here already?

13
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,476
Ah, it's you?!

14
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,225
What is it?

15
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:29,767
N-No way!

16
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,392
The flowers of Naniwa Bay now blossom...
after lying dormant all winter.

17
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:06,392
Now that spring has come,
these flowers bloom.

18
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:15,809
The flowers are blooming.

19
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:21,766
(The leaves of the maple trees...)

20
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,808
(of Mount Mimuro...)
I had no idea karuta cards could fly.

21
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,726
Oh, excuse me.

22
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:28,476
Excuse me.

23
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:30,850
So lovely!

24
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,601
Dad! Please be quiet!

25
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:33,934
Isn't she a beauty?

26
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:35,183
Just like an idol.

27
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,726
She looks so good in kimono!

28
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,391
So, why are we watching
this karuta competition?

29
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:42,226
Because Mikiko told us to!

30
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:45,725
She said to stay at the waiting room.

31
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:50,308
But Uncle followed that pretty girl
right into the studio!

32
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,850
Who's Mikiko?

33
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,850
Didn't I introduce her just now?

34
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,726
The girl in glasses who is competing
with that pretty girl!

35
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:01,183
She's the captain of my school's karuta club.

36
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:02,683
I'm from that club too.

37
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,683
Kazuha, you're part of the karuta club?

38
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,725
Yes! Didn't you know?

39
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,433
Haven't they been to the toilet
for rather long now?

40
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:10,516
Sorry.

41
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:14,016
The studio entrance was closed.
I didn't know if it was okay to open it.

42
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,351
Excuse me.

43
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:16,975
We are currently in the middle of rehearsal,

44
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,433
(Even this life, )
so could you quiet down a bit?

45
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,226
R-Right.

46
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:27,933
that I would not be sorry to forfeit...

47
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,391
Whoa! So cool!

48
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:30,600
Hey, Kudo.

49
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:34,475
Did the old man forget that our purpose
for coming to Osaka is for the interview?

50
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:36,308
Ah, give him a break.

51
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,975
The children were whining that
they wanted to visit Osaka,

52
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:41,892
but the professor was busy
so he had to take them.

53
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:45,142
Speaking of which, where is that rich girl?

54
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,101
Oh, Sonoko...

55
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,142
She's down with a cold.

56
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,016
I never knew.

57
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:55,100
So Kazuha joined the karuta club.

58
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,100
I'm in both the Aikido club
and the Karuta club!

59
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:01,433
The Karuta club has so few new members.
it might be disbanded soon.

60
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:04,350
Hence I'm a zombie member
who put my name down,

61
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,558
and occasionally serve
as Mikiko's practice opponent.

62
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,934
A zombie club member... how weird.

63
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,726
It's so fun and lively in here.

64
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,309
I wonder if I'm in a cafÃ©.

65
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,309
S-Sorry!

66
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,559
DETECTIVE CONAN: THE CRIMSON LOVE LETTER

67
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,184
I am high school student detective,
Kudo Shinichi.

68
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,225
One day, at an amusement park

69
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:45,683
with my childhood friend
and classmate Mori Ran,

70
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,641
I witnessed
a suspicious-looking man in black...

71
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,934
...carrying out a deal.

72
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:53,433
Too engrossed in watching,

73
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,808
I failed to notice,

74
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,309
another of his accomplices...
approach me from behind.

75
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,142
That man forced a poison down my throat,

76
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,142
and when I woke up,

77
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,892
my body had shrunk!

78
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:14,683
If those men knew that
Kudo Shinichi was still alive,

79
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:18,476
they would target my life again
and endanger those around me.

80
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:23,433
Taking Professor Agasa's advice,
I hid my identity.

81
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:26,392
But when Ran asked for my name,
I spontaneously told her

82
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,850
it was 'Edogawa Conan'.

83
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,808
Because Ran's father is a detective,

84
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:34,726
I moved in with her family
to gather information on those men.

85
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:40,934
This is Hattori Heiji,
high school detective of the West.

86
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,433
Having inherited his father's
superior deductive reasoning

87
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:44,600
as chief of the Osaka Prefectural Police,

88
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,101
he has cracked many difficult cases.

89
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,892
He is one of the few
who know my true identity.

90
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:57,016
Toyama Kazuha is Hattori's childhood friend
and classmate.

91
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,516
What will become of them,

92
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:03,142
now that a love rival claiming
to be his future bride has appeared?!

93
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:09,642
Finally, the mysterious future queen.
Who exactly is she?

94
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,726
Even though my body has shrunk,
my brain is still unchanged.

95
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,976
I'm the one and only detective
who closes every case!

96
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:20,017
There is always only one truth!

97
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,351
(Nichiuri Television)

98
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:29,558
I'm here at the TV station
but am stuck in the waiting area!

99
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,475
I want to watch the live recording!

100
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,558
That's not possible.

101
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,808
Even Uncle Kogoro was making an angry fuss...

102
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:35,933
(Satsuki Association World of Karuta)
Sorry, everyone.

103
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,476
(Mr. Mouri Kogoro)
It's all my fault.

104
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,017
Oh, I know!

105
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:41,641
Shall we go souvenir shopping
when everyone gets back?

106
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,350
- Really?
- Do you mean that?

107
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:46,266
Yes. But only if you all be good
until the recording is over.

108
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,391
Of course!

109
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:48,351
Hurray!

110
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:49,725
Let's all go shopping together!

111
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,141
Hey, wait a minute.

112
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,683
Where's Conan?

113
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:54,059
Oh, speaking of Conan...

114
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,433
He's doing something on my behalf.

115
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,433
He's keeping an eye on my dad.

116
00:06:58,434 --> 00:06:59,891
Hey, boy!

117
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,059
Didn't I tell you to stay
in the waiting area?

118
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,600
But Ran told me to keep an eye
on the recording situation.

119
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,351
Yeah, right!

120
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,433
Please make way!

121
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:11,225
Move aside, please!
Kurata cards coming through!

122
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,184
Wow, the Karuta cards
for the Satsuki Association!

123
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,225
Those Karuta cards are so famous!

124
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,100
Tell me about it, Kazuha!

125
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:21,433
Those are the very same cards
used by the Satsuki Association

126
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:24,184
for the Finals of the
National Karuta Compeititon?

127
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,016
It's your dream to compete with those cards.
Right, Mikiko?

128
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,350
I'm not the only one.

129
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:31,308
In the Satsuki Association's
20-year history,

130
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,601
there is no one
who does not long for those cards.

131
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:37,141
Ah, if I could only
just touch those legendary cards once,

132
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:38,725
in a finals round...

133
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,891
Say...

134
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,476
Why are those cards used
only in the final round?

135
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,350
After so many rounds of intense competition,

136
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:47,058
they must have suffered
quite a bit of damage.

137
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,516
No wonder they are encased,
only to be used in the final round.

138
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,267
The rest of the time,
they are on display at the museum.

139
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,933
Still, isn't the security
a bit too heavy for just cards?

140
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,266
Not at all.

141
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,850
After last year's Satsuki Cup,

142
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,642
it was chaos when the karuta cards
were found missing.

143
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,350
As a result, even though the cards
were recovered at once,

144
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,308
the champion Yajima wanted
reinforced security,

145
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,892
and seems to have successfully
persuaded President Achiha into doing so.

146
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:15,476
I see. By the way, who are those two?

147
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:18,391
Are you an idiot, old man?

148
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,558
Don't you recognise your interviewers?!

149
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,684
Oh, that's right.

150
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,641
- As expected of the old man.
- And speaking of Satsuki,

151
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:24,891
shouldn't it be a horse?

152
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:28,226
Here it is, a write-up
on President Achiha Kensuke.

153
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,933
A magnate who built Achiha Properties
in a single generation,

154
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,100
also known as Naniwa's king of property.

155
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:37,016
Why would such a person
be interested in karuta?

156
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,975
Apparently, it is his only hobby.

157
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,766
And he seems to be rather good at it too.

158
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:46,391
But it says here that Achiha personally
would rather be a reader than a player.

159
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,141
W-Whoa! Who is this beautiful lady?

160
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:51,725
That's Achiha's wife, Satsuki.

161
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,766
Darn it, she's married!

162
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:57,725
Satsuki Association was originally founded
by Queen Satsuki.

163
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:01,058
Achiha gradually took over
and became the president.

164
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,891
Another interview topic could be...

165
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,851
Oh, this looks interesting.

166
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:10,933
Achiha would always wash his car the day

167
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:14,266
before his wife, Satsuki,
had an important match.

168
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,225
Because as the saying goes,

169
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,516
the secret to winning is
to make your car look good.

170
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,850
So, I'll be attending the interview
with this husband and wife pair?

171
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:23,642
No.

172
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:28,559
Satsuki died of an illness three years ago.

173
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:32,641
Only President Achiha will be present
at today's interview.

174
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:33,559
I... I see.

175
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:39,141
Hey, who is this tough looking guy?
He's always within Achiha's reach.

176
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,308
Ah, that would be...

177
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,809
...Achiha's former secretary, Kaieda Togo.

178
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:45,016
He's a highly capable person

179
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,100
who single-handedly manages
Achiha Properties's clandestine activities.

180
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,475
Wonder where he went
after retiring as secretary...

181
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:51,850
Wait a minute, Hattori!

182
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,475
Don't say such things if you have no proof.

183
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,350
The president would never do that!

184
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:57,391
That's right, Heiji!

185
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:00,016
Calm down... Those were just rumours.

186
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,476
The president has entered!

187
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,516
It's President Achiha. We've to greet him.

188
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:07,516
Mr President.
We will be counting on you today.

189
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:09,933
Indeed, I'll be counting on you too.

190
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:10,726
Yes.

191
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:11,766
Correct me if I'm wrong,

192
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,808
but will today's schedule
be the demonstration match

193
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,100
between Yajima and Momiji,

194
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:16,766
followed by the interview?

195
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:17,684
Yes.

196
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:22,016
When airing, we have last week's recording
with Yajima's help.

197
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:24,558
The special feature
on the Satsuki Association's Karuta

198
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,975
will promote Karuta on a nationwide basis.

199
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:31,683
Ah, I see the karuta cards meant
for the Satsuki Cup are already on display.

200
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,183
I'll be counting on you then.

201
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:33,976
Yes!

202
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,683
What an overwhelming presence.

203
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:38,516
Indeed.
As expected of Naniwa's property king.

204
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:41,517
Sorry. Can someone get in touch with Yajima?

205
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,558
It's almost his turn.

206
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,766
But I can't seem to contact him at all.

207
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,266
That's strange.

208
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:51,391
He said he'd be here an hour
before the recording goes live.

209
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:54,558
Yajima is a stickler for time and he's late?

210
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,475
Please ask Sekine to standby just in case.

211
00:10:57,476 --> 00:11:00,726
If anything happens,
he can stand-in for Yajima.

212
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,892
It... It can't be.

213
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,600
There's still time
before the recording starts.

214
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:23,559
Yes, there is!

215
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,766
Hey Heiji,
where are we going for okonomiyaki?

216
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,475
There's only one place
to go for okonomiyaki.

217
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:31,017
Indeed! Okonomiyaki is...

218
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,892
Sorry about that. Are you alright?

219
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:38,809
You were one of the karuta players
from just now!

220
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:41,017
This is fate...

221
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:47,517
I have waited to meet you...

222
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,351
My future husband.

223
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:51,601
Future...

224
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:52,517
Husband?!

225
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:57,351
I have some free time after the recording.

226
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:58,934
If you don't mind,
would you like to go for tea together?

227
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,808
She sure is huge!

228
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,600
W-Wait a second! What exactly are you...

229
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:03,517
No, wait...

230
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:04,891
Momiji!

231
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,641
Sorry, but please return to the waiting area.

232
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,851
Aww, but I was getting to the good part...

233
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:13,308
Actually, Yajima is late.

234
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,226
Yajima?

235
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:18,266
Well, he is after all
in-charge of this program

236
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,226
and must be held up by some matters.

237
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,767
Well then, see you around, Heiji!

238
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,767
Yeah, see you!

239
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,391
Who is she?!

240
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,100
That pretty lady!

241
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:30,350
She's beautiful, isn't she?

242
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,183
Unless I'm mistaken,
I heard her say she was... Momiji!

243
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,475
Like I said... I have no idea!

244
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,891
But she knew your name!

245
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,141
- Ran?
- I won't be angry, so tell me the truth!

246
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,975
- Let's go wait outside.
- You're angry already!

247
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,850
-Looks like something's going on.

248
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:42,642
Let's go!

249
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:45,850
- I'm not angry.
- What exactly is she mad about?

250
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:49,433
Well... maybe we did
meet each other somewhere.

251
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,391
See?! I was right! You knew each other!

252
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,100
I said I don't know her!

253
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:57,975
There's no way anyone could forget
meeting a babe like that.

254
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,934
A babe?!

255
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,934
Well, you're hard to forget too,
in a different way.

256
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,266
What?

257
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,850
What did you mean by that?!

258
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,100
Hey, hey.

259
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,892
Heiji, do you really not know that person?

260
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,600
Ooka... Momiji?

261
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,726
"High school champion
of the Satsuki Cup for two years running."

262
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,808
"Second-year student
of Kyoto Senshin High School."

263
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:21,767
"She is very likely
the future Karuta queen..."

264
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,141
Ooka Momiji?

265
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,309
The future queen?

266
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,516
(Osaka Prefectural Police)
Is this the warning?

267
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,642
Yes. It states "There will be an explosion
at Nichiuri Television."

268
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,308
What does this Karuta photograph mean?

269
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,351
It was sent as an email attachment.

270
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,434
I'm still not sure what it means.

271
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,016
And is Nichiuri Television aware of this?

272
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:46,308
I gave them a heads up.

273
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,517
What are your thoughts, Heizo?

274
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:51,683
It might be a prank, or an alert.

275
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,142
It's hard to tell
from the email alone, but...

276
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:57,601
...things could escalate
if it turns out not to be a prank.

277
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,016
We have received
an emergency evaculation alert

278
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:02,851
from the Osaka Prefectural Police.

279
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,350
- Kindly cease all activities and recordings,
- What's this announcement?

280
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,808
and evacuate the building using
the nearest emergency stairwells.

281
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,933
- I repeat.
- What?

282
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,850
An evacuation drill at this time?

283
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,475
Is something wrong?

284
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,683
It's from the police.

285
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:16,809
Any TV recording taking place?

286
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,558
Hey! Go check it out!

287
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,976
Y-Yes!

288
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,142
What's happening?

289
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:31,142
Kazuha!

290
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,184
Hurry up and get to the emergency exit!
You got that?!

291
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:35,183
Yup! What about you?

292
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,391
Not before I find out what's going on!

293
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,851
You just get out of here first!

294
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,559
Wait... Heiji!

295
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,975
That was close!

296
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:45,851
It's dangerous.

297
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,391
-Kid! Where do you think you're going?!

298
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:51,391
I left something in the studio...

299
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,433
Idiot!

300
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,809
Didn't you hear the announcement?

301
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,517
Sorry,

302
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,641
this is also my first time...

303
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,809
I've never done
an evacuation drill dressed in kimono...

304
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,975
This is bad. Let's evacuate quickly!

305
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,558
Calm down. What happened?

306
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,850
There was an explosion threat.

307
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:10,642
What?

308
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,808
President Achiha! It might be a hoax,

309
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,558
but let's get to safety
while confirming that.

310
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,642
Yes, you're right.

311
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:20,141
Everyone! Do as the announcement said
and get out of here!

312
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:20,934
Hurry!

313
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,434
Y-Yes!

314
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,475
What are you doing, Mikiko?

315
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,725
It's not safe here. Get out of here, quick!

316
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,308
Achiha, you too!

317
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:32,851
What are you doing? Get out of here, quick!

318
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,308
Everyone, please calm down and move along.

319
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,266
We are performing safety checks
within the building.

320
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:42,308
Everyone, stay where you are and wait.

321
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,558
What? Wait again?

322
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,391
-There's no connection...

323
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:48,058
We left dad alone and came out,

324
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:49,891
-I wonder if he's alright.

325
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:51,017
Ran!

326
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,183
Dad! Conan!

327
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:55,976
Hey, what exactly is going on here?

328
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,725
-Are they really

329
00:15:57,726 --> 00:16:00,100
doing an evacuation drill
without prior notice?

330
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:03,683
-Well, I asked the TV crew just now...

331
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,934
- Looks like there really was a bomb threat at this building.
- What's the matter? Conan...

332
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,891
You can't be serious.

333
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,433
By the way, where are Kazuha and Hattori?

334
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,392
What?

335
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,433
Weren't they with you guys?

336
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah...

337
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,266
I'm worried. I'll go look for them.

338
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,975
No, I'll go!

339
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,642
None of you are to leave this spot.

340
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,059
Got that?!

341
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:31,559
Darn it, an evacuation drill now
of all times!

342
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,141
Heiji!

343
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,476
Mikiko!

344
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,391
What did I tell you? Get out of here!

345
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:41,434
I know, but I was worried about you two!

346
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:45,976
Sorry, Kazuha!

347
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,517
I just can't leave the karuta cards behind!

348
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,726
Judging from the GPS coordinates
on the smartphone...

349
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,601
Hattori still hasn't left the building?!

350
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,683
You!

351
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:05,933
What are you doing?

352
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:08,142
Leave that behind and evacuate at once!

353
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:09,101
Darn it!

354
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,600
Mikiko!

355
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,683
Kazuha! Hattori!

356
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:15,308
Guys, you have no idea how dangerous this is.

357
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,184
I'm sorry!

358
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,225
I'm sorry!

359
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,559
Seriously...

360
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:22,391
I have three persons here at Studio 3.

361
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,683
Mikiko!

362
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,641
- Gosh, why did you do that?
- They are the last three.

363
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:27,141
- Sorry...
- Evacuate them at once.

364
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:30,058
- If the bomb threat was real,
- Understood!

365
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,059
it would make no difference anyway.

366
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,225
I don't know when it will explode.

367
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,601
We will wait for instructions remotely.

368
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,475
I'll leave it to you.

369
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,391
The remaining three
from the studio have started evacuating.

370
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,850
Is that everyone?

371
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,684
Yes!

372
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:45,976
Alright!

373
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,933
The search for the dangerous object
will now commence!

374
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,475
All units, prepare to enter!

375
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,767
Understood!

376
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,934
- They went in.
- Is there really a bomb?

377
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,976
It's probably just a prank.

378
00:17:58,476 --> 00:17:59,267
Over here, quick!

379
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:00,892
Over here!

380
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:10,976
It's for real?!

381
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,725
All units, back down!

382
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,891
All members, back down!

383
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:19,351
Get away from the building!

384
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,351
Mr President, hurry!

385
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:29,267
Danger!

386
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:30,642
Kazuha!

387
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,101
- Wow
- No! It's dangerous, stay down.

388
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,059
Darn it, where are they?!

389
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,309
Was Hattori still inside when it exploded?!

390
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,808
Kazuha!

391
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,016
You can't go!

392
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,266
It's not safe here.

393
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,391
Now, let's move.

394
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,600
It hurts.

395
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:53,225
Are you alright? Can you walk?

396
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,266
Y-Yes...

397
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,225
Good. Let's go, this way!

398
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:59,100
This way, you can go step-by-step...

399
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,183
Yes...

400
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,516
- More people are coming out!
- So there were people still inside!

401
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,267
They said there were two remaining...

402
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:15,517
What?!

403
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:18,601
Kazuha, over here!

404
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,351
Darn it!

405
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:25,642
Heiji!

406
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:27,767
That was close!

407
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,226
Run!

408
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,266
We can't go down...

409
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,683
Kazuha, over here!

410
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:41,183
- We've got to go higher!
- What's going on?! Aren't we going down?

411
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,391
If we can't find a way out,

412
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,476
we've got to go somewhere we can breathe!

413
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:48,476
No way. Hattori...

414
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,059
Did he climb up?

415
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,976
Darn... we didn't make it.

416
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,017
Let's go, Kazuha!

417
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,891
Kazuha!

418
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:06,809
Over here!

419
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:10,642
The roof top... Is it made of concrete?

420
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,517
Get nearer! We need to close in!

421
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:17,767
It's impossible!

422
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,392
Getting any nearer would be too dangerous!

423
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:21,517
Excuse me! Let me through!

424
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,558
Darn it!

425
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,434
The smoke is blocking my vision!

426
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:34,891
I can't do this alone... not by myself!

427
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,309
Kudo!!

428
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,892
We've got to take a chance.

429
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:43,601
It's do or die.

430
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:59,851
Come on!

431
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:02,517
What's that?

432
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,601
At last.

433
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,517
Hattori...

434
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,600
Wait, Heiji. Where are you doing?

435
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,850
Come on! This is the only way down!

436
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,600
Down... from here?

437
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,100
Stay right here, Kazuha. You got that?!

438
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:31,976
Wait, Heiji!!

439
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:33,641
Get down from here...

440
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:34,392
are you kidding me?

441
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,516
Hey, I'm ready whenever you are.

442
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:37,476
Ditto.

443
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:38,975
There's no time. I'll do this in one shot.

444
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,141
Right!

445
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:40,726
Kazuha!

446
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,225
You can't be serious.

447
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:43,766
Stop! I can't see...

448
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,308
Is this a joke?! Heiji!

449
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,058
Close your eyes and hold on!

450
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,141
What? Wh...?

451
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,809
Wait...

452
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:55,642
Thanks for this. See you at the bottom.

453
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:57,184
Yup.

454
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:07,309
Kudo!

455
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:16,226
Darn it!

456
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,142
Kudo!!

457
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,433
Don't tell me there's someone there. Quick!

458
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,016
I was right, there is!

459
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,351
Stretcher, get a stretcher over here!

460
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,434
Kazuha!

461
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,392
Heiji?

462
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:42,767
Darn it...

463
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:45,391
And that was the only way down from here.

464
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:48,642
Think! There has to be
another way out of this place.

465
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,142
A rescue helicopter!

466
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,308
No, it's impossible.

467
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:55,016
It can't even get close
with all the flames and smoke,

468
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:57,267
much less make a landing.

469
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,600
Hang on,

470
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,642
there's a river next to the TV station.

471
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,267
If I can somehow jump into that...

472
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,226
Alright!

473
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,267
No, I can't.

474
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:10,434
There's no more room
for the skateboard to accelerate...

475
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,933
This is bad.

476
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,308
My lungs feel like
they're on fire with even a tiny breath.

477
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:21,309
I need a plan... and fast!

478
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:28,434
Ran...

479
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:35,266
I can't simply give up...

480
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:40,101
There must be some room
for the skateboard to move... come on...

481
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,101
Over there!

482
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:46,434
What are you doing, Kudo? Come on!

483
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,850
That's...

484
00:23:56,851 --> 00:24:00,642
No mistake, it's Kudo. But what is he...?

485
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,391
I see!

486
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:04,809
So that's it!

487
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:09,434
Come on...

488
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:12,392
More speed...

489
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,516
Darn it... it's getting harder to breathe...

490
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,684
Just a little more!

491
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,433
It's falling!

492
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:28,392
Is this the maximum?!

493
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:30,392
Darn!

494
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,351
There wasn't enough acceleration!

495
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:34,892
Oh no, I won't make it!

496
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:41,725
We were waiting!

497
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,642
Here!

498
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,059
Hey Kudo, are you alright?

499
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,475
I guess...

500
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:04,308
Here, you dropped this.

501
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,559
Thanks.

502
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,016
Come to think of it...

503
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:08,350
Why did you bring that thing today?

504
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,351
Did you know that Nichiuri Television
was going to get bombed?

505
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,808
Of course not.

506
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,934
It's in case of an emergency.

507
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,266
And that emergency just happened to be today.

508
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,517
Looks that way.

509
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,475
Kazuha!

510
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:29,850
Ran!

511
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:30,851
Are you alright?

512
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:33,516
Yes. Except for breathing lots of smoke,

513
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:36,725
I don't recall much.

514
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:38,600
It's a relief that you're fine.

515
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,016
In any case, it's good that you're alright

516
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:40,851
Yup...

517
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:41,642
Ran,

518
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:43,725
I might have dropped the car keys somewhere.

519
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:44,808
I'm going to look for them.

520
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,891
Okay.

521
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,850
Come to think of it, where's Conan?

522
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:48,559
Right.

523
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,100
I thought he was at the evacuation centre...

524
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,516
Oh, it's Conan!

525
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:52,976
It is!

526
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:55,100
Conan! Where have you been?

527
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:57,183
We were so worried!

528
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,391
Hi, Kazuha.

529
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,766
Hey, Heiji!

530
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,350
Where have you been all this while?

531
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,100
Ah, well you see...

532
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:04,600
You too, Conan.

533
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,975
I was so worried.

534
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,391
Sorry.

535
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,016
By the way, where's Mikiko?

536
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:13,475
Apparently she injured her arm
and was taken to the hospital.

537
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,558
Her arm?

538
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,266
Hopefully it's nothing serious.

539
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,225
I found out which hospital she was sent to.

540
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:20,766
Shall we all go later?

541
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,392
Okay. Let's go!

542
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,391
Heiji.

543
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:26,392
Ootaki.

544
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,100
Thank goodness you're alright.

545
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,559
Sorry, Kazuha. Please go on without me.

546
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,517
I'll catch up.

547
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:35,100
Oh... Let's go, Ran.

548
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:37,850
Okay. Come on, Conan.

549
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:39,350
R-Right.

550
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:41,100
Don't get separated again.

551
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:41,934
Okay.

552
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,892
See you around, Conan.

553
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:47,975
Is it true that
the police received a bomb alert?

554
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:50,684
This is the email that the police received.

555
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,641
An attachment of a Karuta card?

556
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,933
There might be some connection between this

557
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:59,475
and the Karuta program they were recording...

558
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:02,308
That's the state of Nichiuri Television...

559
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:05,850
Looks like the investigation
will take some time.

560
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,766
Looks like it.

561
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:11,684
What exactly is the perpetrator's motive?

562
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:14,934
(Naniwa Police Hospital)

563
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,100
Thank you for your care.

564
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:20,266
Sure. Please take care.

565
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:21,975
Mr President, are you alright?

566
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:25,058
Oh, it's nothing. Just a few scratches.

567
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,433
That's a relief.

568
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:29,975
But why did this have to happen
right before the tournament?

569
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:32,392
Indeed, who would have known?

570
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:37,558
What a pity that this year's Satsuki Cup
has to be cancelled because of this.

571
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,933
We mustn't give in!

572
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,433
It's times like these that

573
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:43,516
we need to push forward
to preserve the Satsuki Club's image!

574
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,475
But the Karuta cards for the Satsuki Cup
have been burnt.

575
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:46,516
Without those Karuta cards,

576
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:48,600
the tradition of the Satsuki Cup
cannot be continued.

577
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,725
There's no need to worry about that.

578
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:51,975
The karuta cards are safe.

579
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,433
What?

580
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:54,766
Whatever do you mean?

581
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,141
Hiramoto took them
during the evacuation process.

582
00:27:58,142 --> 00:28:00,100
Mikiko did that?

583
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:02,516
The Karuta cards would have naturally
been destroyed in the fire,

584
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:03,683
but they are safe!

585
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,559
Is that the truth?!

586
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,183
Were the Karuta cards for the Satsuki Cup
really not destroyed in the fire?

587
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:12,350
T-The museum staff took the cards away
to check for damages and all...

588
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,433
Mr President,

589
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,350
the Karuta cards are safe,

590
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:16,726
so please calm down.

591
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:20,725
And I was sure that it was the end...
what great news!

592
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:24,975
And what about Mikiko who saved the cards?
How is she?

593
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:27,975
I heard that her life isn't in danger, but...

594
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:30,392
...it seems she's still under observation.

595
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:32,308
I see.

596
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,600
Mikiko sure is taking a long time.

597
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:37,350
The doctor said that
she just needed some first aid...

598
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,100
Thank you very much.

599
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:42,225
Mikiko! Your arm! Don't tell me...

600
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,809
Yeah. It's broken, most likely.

601
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,975
I guess it's karma.

602
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,016
No way...

603
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:50,600
I went back fort he karuta cards

604
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:53,100
and risked both Kazuha
and Hattori's lives in the process...

605
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,641
What do you mean?

606
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,600
Thank you, Mikiko.

607
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,725
You saved the Karuta cards

608
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:00,850
which are the pride
of the Satsuki Association.

609
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:05,891
As President, I cannot thank you enough.

610
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,225
But, Mr President!

611
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:09,516
I won't be able to participate in the event
with my arm like this...

612
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:13,266
It's a loss for the Satsuki cup that

613
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:16,516
someone with your capability can't take part,

614
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:20,183
but you really ought to focus
on getting better right now.

615
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,600
That's right.

616
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,600
There's always next year too, right?

617
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,558
That won't happen.

618
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,808
Unless I achieve good results
in this year's Satsuki Cup,

619
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,975
the Karuta club will surely be shut down.

620
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:34,476
I can't let the Karuta club
be shut down during my tenure...

621
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:35,851
Mr President.

622
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:38,141
The police are waiting.

623
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,101
It's about time.

624
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,683
Cheer up, Mikiko.

625
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,016
But...

626
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:44,017
Well it is true that

627
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:48,183
none of the other members
can play karuta except for us...

628
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:49,683
That's right, Kazuha!

629
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,016
You should compete!

630
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:54,308
Replace me as our school representative!

631
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,308
What? You can't just decide like that...

632
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:58,683
Kazuha, have you participated
in any tournament before?

633
00:29:58,684 --> 00:29:59,808
No, never...

634
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:02,350
But you have been practising
with me all this while.

635
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:02,976
Y-Yeah.

636
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:07,933
You have the strength
and your reflexes are quick.

637
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,433
Also, your never say die attitude
makes you undefeatable!

638
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,933
And you're really thick-skinned
in a weird kind of way.

639
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:16,016
Somehow, that didn't sound like a compliment.

640
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,433
When does the competition start?

641
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,850
The day after tomorrow.

642
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:21,933
It will be fine!

643
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:23,475
If we start training now,

644
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,976
Kazuha will make it somehow!

645
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,683
A beginner competing in the event
with the aim of becoming champion?

646
00:30:30,684 --> 00:30:35,100
Might as well just change Hyakkunin Isshu
to Iroha karuta.

647
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,808
Don't make fun of her.

648
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:41,100
I'm the one Kazuha's been practicing with,
so I know her strengths best!

649
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:42,766
Despite not having experience
in competitions,

650
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,851
her skills are top class, without a doubt!

651
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,517
Is she really that good?

652
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:52,850
Not to mention you
seem really close to Heiji.

653
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,433
What kind of relationship
do you two have exactly?

654
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:59,391
We've known each other
since we were kids! Heiji and I...

655
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:00,808
We're...

656
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,850
Sweethearts?

657
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,350
I could tell right away!

658
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:05,433
It's really obvious!

659
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:07,141
Stop interrupting!

660
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:10,850
Sounds like Poem 40 of the Hyakkunin Isshu
to me. (A poem about being in love).

661
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:13,058
Talk about childhood sweethearts.

662
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,434
Aww, how heartwarming.

663
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,058
I'll tell you what.

664
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,308
Whoever wins the event
the day after tomorrow,

665
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:23,016
will be the top candidate as Heiji's bride.

666
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:24,017
In other words,

667
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,641
she has priority over confessing to Heiji
and winning his heart.

668
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:27,516
How about that?

669
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:29,683
W-What are you trying to do?!

670
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,266
If you're serious about him,

671
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,933
you ought to be
motivated enough for this, right?

672
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,891
Kazuha,
you don't have to take her up on this.

673
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,141
I'll tell you one thing though.

674
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:41,309
I'm serious about him.

675
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,476
Wait!

676
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,891
I accept...

677
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:48,476
your challenge!

678
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,308
K-Kazuha!

679
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,184
I-Is she for real?

680
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,141
I hope your determination doesn't run out

681
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:55,808
before the competition date.

682
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,933
Likewise to you.
Don't burn out before our match!

683
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,475
I'll excuse myself then.

684
00:32:02,476 --> 00:32:04,141
I need to go to the nail salon,

685
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:06,684
and think about what to say to Heiji
during my confessoin.

686
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,558
What a scary lady.

687
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,059
Yeah.

688
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,850
I can't believe I saw that.

689
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,141
You're unbelievable as always.

690
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:19,516
Fancy speaking to Momiji that way!

691
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:20,642
What should I do?

692
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,226
I made a terrible promise...

693
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,016
I'm so sorry.

694
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:30,766
Oh no, it was my fault too.

695
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,933
Dad. Did you find the keys?

696
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,683
No, I seached everywhere.

697
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,684
But I just couldn't find them.

698
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:41,392
Guess I'll just have to duplicate them.

699
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,558
What's wrong, Conan?

700
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,641
The lady from earlier must have dropped this.

701
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:49,184
Really? Let me see.

702
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,391
No mistake, this belongs to Momiji.

703
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:53,141
Dad, I'll go give this back.

704
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:54,475
Eh? Is it someone you know?

705
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:55,850
Gosh, this is depressing.

706
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,600
What do you think I should do?

707
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,308
What do you mean by that?

708
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:00,975
It was kind of scary.

709
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:02,808
She was really pretty!

710
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,808
If Heiji got a confession from that girl,

711
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:07,351
he'd be head over heels in love for sure.

712
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:10,558
B-But the one who really suits him...
is Kazuha!

713
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,309
Really?

714
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,100
Really, really!

715
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,225
No time for that kind of talk now.

716
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,351
Training starts tonight!

717
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:22,683
This is my first time at a hospital.

718
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,975
It's so huge, I feel like I could get lost.

719
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,141
Ran. She's there. Over there!

720
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:28,391
Momiji!

721
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,351
Wait up!

722
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,101
Momiji, wait!

723
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:35,976
Oh, she left.

724
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,850
What should we do about this?

725
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,975
We know her name and school,

726
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,933
but to get her contact number...
It'd be quicker to look inside for it?

727
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,475
That's true.

728
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:46,391
Ran, let me see.

729
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:47,558
Okay.

730
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,016
Let's see, this is...

731
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:50,766
- A photo.
- This person...

732
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,642
Who is it?

733
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:55,267
Wait, there's another one.

734
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,808
It looks like a childhood photo.

735
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,808
It's Momiji, and...

736
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,850
Hattori?

737
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:04,601
They're doing a pinky promise.

738
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:08,350
I wonder what kind of promise.

739
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:10,517
A promise to get married?

740
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,808
Even at that young age?

741
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,016
That can't be right, can it?

742
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:18,100
Actually,
that's the sort of thing he would do.

743
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:19,559
Knowing that guy...

744
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,184
That's Heiji's bike.

745
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,601
We must keep that photo a secret, okay?

746
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:30,058
Especially from Kazuha!

747
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,101
Yes.

748
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,517
Wow. Did you both come out to welcome us?

749
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:44,100
What's up with her?

750
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,850
Ran. Have you delivered the item?

751
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,392
Y-Yeah.

752
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,559
You're late.

753
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:52,891
Huh? Found anything?

754
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:56,808
No, the Osaka Prefectural Police
are still in a state of chaos.

755
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:00,475
Ootaki will contact us
once they've gathered all the information.

756
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:01,351
Mr President,

757
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:03,475
it seems like something important.

758
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,516
Would you take this call?

759
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,850
Oh. Sure.

760
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,225
Good grief.

761
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,516
What's gotten into Ran?

762
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,184
Ah... what,
from the Kyoto Prefectural Police?

763
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:13,767
Yes.

764
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:16,601
And what about Yajima?

765
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:17,476
What?

766
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:18,392
He was murdered?!

767
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,266
- Okay.
- I understand.

768
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:23,934
I'll cancel eveything and be right there.

769
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:30,601
Thanks for the hard work.

770
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,225
Just a minute kids,

771
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:36,933
this place is off limits.

772
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,141
We're with Mouri Kogorou.

773
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:40,558
What nonsense did you say?

774
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,517
Let those kids through.

775
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,725
Long time no see, the pair of you.

776
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:48,559
Detective Ayanokouji!

777
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:52,350
The victim was Yajima Toshiya.

778
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,183
He was the son
of a distinguished sake-making family.

779
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,267
It seems he lived alone in this mansion.

780
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,808
The time of death is estimated at 6 am.

781
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:02,850
His body was discovered at 2 pm,
8 hours after he died.

782
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:05,683
Oh, please watch your step.

783
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:07,683
It looks like they made quite a mess in here.

784
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:10,558
Was it a robbery?

785
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,058
Looking at the crime scene,

786
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,350
it is definitely a murder case.

787
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:17,142
Yeah, we think so too.

788
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,475
Someone broken in
with the intention of theft.

789
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,891
And Yajima happened to be at the scene.

790
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:27,141
On the spur of the moment,
the culprit killed Yajima...

791
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:29,642
...with the Japanese sword
he had planned to steal.

792
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,225
But why...?

793
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,516
From the looks of it, the victim seemed
to be practicing karuta when it happened.

794
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,058
That seems to be the case.

795
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:39,766
What...? Why are you all here?!

796
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:40,891
Hey, Inspector.

797
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:43,559
Let me check out the crime scene.

798
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,933
Well, the Criminal Identification Unit
is done here,

799
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,266
so be my guest.

800
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,016
Why is that allowed?!

801
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:50,266
However,

802
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,266
we will be taking the murder weapon with us.

803
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,100
Yes, no problem.

804
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,350
Please assist them as far as they need.

805
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,184
Right.

806
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,516
We'll wait outside,

807
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,642
so let us know if you find anything.

808
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,766
What do you think?

809
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,183
I can't really tell yet.

810
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:12,266
His right hand...

811
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,766
I see you noticed it too, Kudo.

812
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:19,100
It seems like
a bloodstained item was removed from it.

813
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,766
Speaking of bloodstained items in this room...

814
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,350
The karuta cards.

815
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,766
The culprit noticed the victim
left his dying message

816
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,475
and deliberately slipped that card
into the rest of the bloodstained cards.

817
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:31,475
Retrieving that card will be a problem.

818
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,267
Leave that to me.

819
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:36,434
I know someone good at this sort of thing.

820
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:39,266
What is that about?

821
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,308
That remote control,
judging from its blood stains,

822
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,892
should have been right beside the victim
when the murder happened...

823
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:45,725
Excuse me.

824
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,766
Is it alright if I turn on the television?

825
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:48,933
Yes, go ahead.

826
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,016
Thanks.

827
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,808
Could the victim have been
using the remote control

828
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,183
right before he was killed?

829
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,184
What could have been showing at the time?

830
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:58,683
It's Ooka Momiji.

831
00:37:58,684 --> 00:38:00,933
Yajima was probably watching this...

832
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,642
...right before he was attacked!

833
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,141
What's the matter?

834
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:06,100
Looks like videos of old tournaments.

835
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,350
Yes.

836
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:12,683
The 15th to 20th Satsuki Cup.

837
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:15,141
Why was Yajima watching these videos?

838
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:16,433
In karuta,

839
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:19,058
the level of competition heightens quite a bit
by the time they reach the finals.

840
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:21,725
From different skill sets
to card sequence placed,

841
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:24,891
one can learn a lot just by watching.

842
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:27,933
This might have nothing to do
with the murder case.

843
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:28,892
But...

844
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:31,350
But, but, but...
You're nothing but a nuisance!

845
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,725
You too, get going!

846
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,808
- Wait, Uncle!
- Enough of your detective games!

847
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,225
- Sorry about this, guys.
- What are you doing?

848
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:39,350
-Put me down!

849
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,309
Alright, alright. I'll do it so let me go!

850
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,475
And now for the news.
Today, at Osaka Prefecture, Osaka City,

851
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:53,059
- Not this again... how worrying.
- a big explosion took place at Nichiuri Television around 1 pm.

852
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:56,141
Ai, why did you turn it off?

853
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:58,891
If you worry every single time
this news comes on,

854
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,350
you'd be ill in no time.

855
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,433
But...

856
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,850
You got in touch with the kids, right?

857
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:07,559
But I haven't heard from Shinichi.

858
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:10,808
Look.

859
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,100
(Edogawa Conan Incoming Call)
Speak of the devil.

860
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,309
Let me speak to him when you're done.

861
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:17,058
What have you been so busy

862
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,850
with that you didn't even contact us?

863
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:21,808
The Professor was really worried.

864
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,141
Sorry, sorry.

865
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:25,141
There's so much going on here right now.

866
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:26,850
So, what do you need?

867
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:30,058
I just sent some photos to your computer.

868
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:33,476
I need you to check on them,
they're photos of Karuta cards.

869
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,558
First the bombing incident,
now bloodstained Karuta cards?

870
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,559
I need you to identify the one card

871
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,850
from the pile the victim was holding
in his hand when he was murdered.

872
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:46,058
You're good at this sort of stuff,
aren't you?

873
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,392
Honestly, I ought to...

874
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,975
One of the photos is of a person.

875
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:54,766
Could you also find out
whatever you can about that person?

876
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,350
Is this person active in the Karuta scene?

877
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,892
Yes, I suspect so.

878
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:02,433
Alright,
I'll do my best so give me some time.

879
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,225
Great! I'm counting on you then.

880
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:05,059
Bye!

881
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,059
Oh, wait! The Professor wants to...

882
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:09,976
Given the situation,

883
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:13,184
it looks like the key members of
the Satsuki Association are being targetted.

884
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:15,725
We need to shadow two particular individuals.

885
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:17,558
I'll keep an eye on Achiha.

886
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,516
I think we're staying at the same hotel.

887
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:23,309
I'll keep watch on Ooka Momiji then.

888
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:27,225
Wait a minute. Who are you?

889
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:29,850
I'm from the Satsuki Association.
Let me through.

890
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:32,516
Wait a minute, I need to verify that.

891
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:33,975
Sekine!

892
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:36,308
Where have you been?

893
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,058
I tried to contact you again and again.

894
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,725
I'm sorry, Mr President.

895
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:41,683
I had too much to drink last night

896
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:45,183
and fell asleep without realising
that my phone was out of battery.

897
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:46,558
Honestly...

898
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,475
When I woke up,

899
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,600
I saw the news on a bomb explosion
at the TV station.

900
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:55,766
So I contacted the association
and they told me you were at Yajima's place.

901
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:56,933
They also said you were looking for me,

902
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,683
so I rushed over
and it looks like chaos here.

903
00:40:58,684 --> 00:41:02,141
So many policemen too.
What happened to Yajima?

904
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:04,058
I'm sorry to say that

905
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:05,559
Yajima was murdered.

906
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:09,933
It appears to be the work of a robber

907
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,891
He was killed with a Japanese sword
from the corridor.

908
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:12,975
A Japanese sword?

909
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:14,058
No way.

910
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,350
Mr Achiha, who is this?

911
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:17,975
Pardon me.

912
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,558
I'm a member of the Satsuki Association.
I work as a photographer,

913
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,641
my name is Sekine Kouji.

914
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:25,141
Sekine is Yajima's biggest rival.

915
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:27,308
The final matches of the Satsuki Cup

916
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:29,808
over the last two years were
between them both.

917
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,891
Well, I lost two years running

918
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:34,309
and just as I thought
I'd finally beat him this year...

919
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,891
I'll never be able to spar with him again.

920
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,891
So, will the tournament proceed as planned?

921
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:43,641
About that,

922
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:45,016
I'm still at a loss what to do.

923
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,766
Mr President, you can't give up.

924
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:50,641
If the Satsuki Cup is called off
because of Yajima's death,

925
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,725
he would have been beaten in vain.

926
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,141
We'd all be ultimate losers!

927
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:57,183
Sekine, you ought not to say
such disrespectful words.

928
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,184
I see.

929
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,933
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

930
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,933
I'm from the Kyoto Prefectural Police.

931
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:06,475
Could you spare me some time
for two or three questions or so?

932
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:09,100
Of course. I'll do my best to co-operate.

933
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:10,350
This way please, then.

934
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:11,516
Right.

935
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:14,350
- Mouri, I need to return to Osaka soon.
- Hey Kudo,

936
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:16,308
- I think I know who did it.
- Really?

937
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,642
- Me too.
- I'll go with you.

938
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:20,808
Yajima's killer is probably
who we think it is.

939
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,308
But it doesn't seem like
the same person was responsible

940
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,600
for the television station bombing,

941
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:27,225
which was probably targetting
the Satsuki Association instead.

942
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:28,433
Exactly.

943
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:29,434
To be safe,

944
00:42:29,435 --> 00:42:33,516
we'll have to keep tabs
on Achiha and Momiji like we agreed.

945
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,684
Yeah.

946
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:39,225
(Hotel New Otani)

947
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,184
Number One!

948
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,558
Number Two!

949
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,308
You're both cheating! Wait for me!

950
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:47,058
What a big room!

951
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,516
Sonoko booked this for us.

952
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:52,475
You see, she really wanted to join us.

953
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:56,100
That's why she booked a hotel
located near to the TV station.

954
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,684
One would expect no less
of the Suzuki Corporation.

955
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,892
Oh, right.

956
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,183
thought you'd be spending the night training,

957
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:06,266
so I gave instructions for supper
to be prepared for you.

958
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,226
Wow, thanks.

959
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:11,976
Gosh, why am I doing this?

960
00:43:12,684 --> 00:43:16,184
It was the sight of you
supporting your friend with so much energy.

961
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,059
Well, it's no big deal!

962
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:22,225
Now, it's training time!

963
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:23,725
We'll help too!

964
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,600
Please let us know how we can help.

965
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,391
I'll do my best to support you!

966
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:29,226
You guys...

967
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,516
Thank you all so much.

968
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:32,392
Oh, someone's calling.

969
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,600
Who is it?

970
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:34,766
It's the Professor...

971
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,225
I want to speak to him!

972
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:37,683
We'll all speak to him!

973
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,016
Yes, let's.

974
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,433
Please go ahead with your training, ladies.

975
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,976
We'll be over there
so we don't get in your way!

976
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:47,725
Just when they promised us
their full support...

977
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,267
They meant this?

978
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,766
Oh, I can see each of you!

979
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,934
Has anything happened since?

980
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:55,726
We're all safe.

981
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:57,350
We're already at the hotel!

982
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,183
In that case, it's perfect timing.

983
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:00,600
-Don't tell me...

984
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,766
The moment you've all been waiting for!

985
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,726
The Professor's Quiz Corner!

986
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,726
Is that why you called?

987
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:09,475
Okay, let's start!

988
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:14,183
Competitive Karuta has been compared
to a certain Japanese tradition,

989
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,141
one that is labour intensive.

990
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:18,225
Which of the following is it?

991
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:19,808
1. Harvesting tea leaves.

992
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:21,808
2. Kite flying.

993
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,683
3. Making Japanese mochi.

994
00:44:23,684 --> 00:44:25,642
4. Harvesting rice.

995
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,059
It must be the harvesting of tea

996
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,558
since it's similar to picking out
and stacking up the Karuta cards.

997
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,308
Kite Flying (Tako Age)?
I want some Takoyaki...

998
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:35,266
One can play foul in Karuta ("otetsuki")
so it has to be making Japanese mochi (mochi tsuki)?

999
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:37,100
Your final answer?

1000
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,891
The answer is 4, harvesting rice.

1001
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:39,933
Aww, Ai!

1002
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,350
The action of cutting rice from the fields

1003
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:43,142
is like card swiping in karuta.

1004
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:45,059
It's exactly like Karuta!

1005
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,183
Aww, I thought I had all of you.

1006
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:49,350
Hey, kids.

1007
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:52,350
You're travelling now,
so don't stay up too late.

1008
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,976
Okay!

1009
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:56,266
I'm hanging up then.

1010
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:57,516
Okay!

1011
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:59,850
It's so late at night.

1012
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:00,975
A lot happened today...

1013
00:45:00,976 --> 00:45:02,433
They're late, Dad and the others.

1014
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,933
- I wonder if Heiji is with them.
- The sky turned dark so quickly!

1015
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:07,892
If you're worried, why not give him a call?

1016
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:09,976
You're right.

1017
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,141
What's up, Kazuha?

1018
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:17,683
What's up? indeed!

1019
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:20,641
Where are you wandering around at this time?

1020
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:21,850
What? Kyoto?

1021
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,266
What's going on?

1022
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:26,100
Sorry but something came up
so I can't take you back today.

1023
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:27,558
You've got to go home by yourself.

1024
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,058
What's that supposed to mean?

1025
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,975
I thought you were practising with me
for Karuta training.

1026
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:32,892
Training?

1027
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:36,850
I'll be replacing Mikiko...
in the Karuta competition..

1028
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:39,391
But you've never taken part
in a Karuta competition.

1029
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:41,850
Precisely, that's why I've got to train.

1030
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:46,141
Weren't you really good at Karuta
when we were kids?

1031
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,391
Now that you mention it...

1032
00:45:47,392 --> 00:45:51,266
I once took part in a Karuta competition
during elementary school.

1033
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:55,391
I was so surprised when you won, Heiji!

1034
00:45:55,392 --> 00:45:57,891
That was so long ago, I hardly remember it.

1035
00:45:57,892 --> 00:46:00,351
But I remember!

1036
00:46:00,684 --> 00:46:03,058
When Mikiko asked me
to help recruit new members,

1037
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,767
you were the first one I thought of.
I remember all of that.

1038
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,183
Right. Are you done talking about the past?

1039
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,558
I've to hang up soon.

1040
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,641
What's with that attitude?!

1041
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:16,725
Do you have to hang up soon
because you dislike talking to me?

1042
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:18,891
That's not what I said.

1043
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:21,475
Right. I'll be just fine without you, Heiji.

1044
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:23,100
Huh? What was that about?

1045
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,809
I've had enough, and you're a jerk!

1046
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,517
Darn it, what's his problem?

1047
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:34,184
What's up with her?

1048
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,184
No choice then.

1049
00:46:39,726 --> 00:46:42,642
Hi, it's me. I need your help.

1050
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:45,184
(Ooka)
Yup, that's right. I owe you one then.

1051
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:49,058
I'm so tired.

1052
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,350
Welcome back, Uncle.

1053
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:51,391
Good grief.

1054
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,850
Who would have thought
we'd come all this way to Osaka

1055
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,976
only to get caught up in that incident?

1056
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:59,850
Dad? Where's Conan?

1057
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:02,975
He said he wanted a ride back,
and we drove back together, but...

1058
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:04,808
When we got to the hotel,

1059
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:07,767
he said he had something
to tell President Achiha.

1060
00:47:09,017 --> 00:47:11,808
Gosh, that Conan.

1061
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,850
If the culprit is who we think it is,

1062
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:16,559
then his next target tonight
would be President Achiha.

1063
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:24,766
What's up, Ran?

1064
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,600
Are you done with your errand?

1065
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:27,476
Y-Yeah!

1066
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,600
Then please go back to your room, okay?

1067
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:31,766
After what happened, I can't help worrying.

1068
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,351
Yup, I got that. I'll be there soon.

1069
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:41,516
Great.

1070
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:43,891
Now, even if he steps outside,
I can trail him.

1071
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,642
That person... unless I'm mistaken...

1072
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:49,392
What is she doing here?

1073
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:53,934
But we promised

1074
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:59,850
That was amazing!

1075
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:01,350
- Truly amazing!
- I knew I wasn't good enough

1076
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:02,516
to be their practice partner!

1077
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:04,433
- Hey, that was dangerous!
- It's as fast as Kamen Yaiba!

1078
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,434
- Just a little closer, and...
- C'mon, just a bit more...

1079
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:07,558
- I'm back!
- Oh, Conan!

1080
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,184
I brought a worthy opponent.

1081
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,142
Who is it?

1082
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,391
Heiji's mum?

1083
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:19,475
Heiji called me.

1084
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:21,183
So I rushed over.

1085
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:22,601
But why?

1086
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:28,308
I've come to assist Kazuha.

1087
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:30,100
You're about to start karuta training,
aren't you?

1088
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:31,933
T-That's right, but...

1089
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:34,058
I'll be your partner.

1090
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:37,933
As a former Queen,
I might not be of much help, but...

1091
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:39,266
Former Queen?

1092
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:41,600
It was a request
from Heiji himself after all,

1093
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:45,141
so I'll teach you everything I know.

1094
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:47,225
But as time is limited,

1095
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:49,641
practice will be intensive.

1096
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:51,767
Are you up for it?

1097
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:55,684
Yes! I am in your debt!

1098
00:49:02,642 --> 00:49:04,141
I knew you'd show up.

1099
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,308
Inspector Ayanokouji.

1100
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,309
It would appear that great minds think alike.

1101
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:13,016
The little detective isn't with you?

1102
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:15,475
He's keeping tabs on President Achiha.

1103
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:16,850
I see.

1104
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:18,850
You guys make a great team.

1105
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:22,475
Indeed, although I'm regretting
making Momiji my choice.

1106
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:27,517
To think she's living in such a big house...

1107
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:36,892
Thanks for coming all this way.

1108
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,975
I am in the service of Young Mistress Momiji.

1109
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:43,016
My name is Iori.

1110
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:45,726
How about a rest and some tea?

1111
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,476
So you were worried about me
and came all this way...

1112
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:58,267
My future husband.

1113
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:11,891
That's why I said, you were doing it wrong.

1114
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:13,433
Darn.

1115
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:16,142
Looks like he hasn't left the hotel.

1116
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,850
That was a great attempt from you.

1117
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,100
To be honest,
I didn't think you could go this far.

1118
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:26,266
Now then, shall we take a break?

1119
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:28,350
Not yet... I don't need one!

1120
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:30,976
Rest is also an important part of training.

1121
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:36,017
I'll be having some porridge then.

1122
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,476
Kazuha.

1123
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,476
Are you alright?

1124
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,016
Let her sleep.

1125
00:50:47,017 --> 00:50:49,600
She hasn't slept a wink. Amazing work.

1126
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,766
How did Kazuha do?

1127
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,933
Her potential way exceeded
what I expected of her.

1128
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:55,891
While she can easily get into the top four,

1129
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:59,308
entering the final championship
may prove difficult.

1130
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,059
No way...

1131
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,101
Hear me out. I'm not done.

1132
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:07,558
I said it would be difficult,

1133
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,475
but not impossible.

1134
00:51:09,476 --> 00:51:14,433
After all, the keys to competitive karuta...
are mental strength and focus.

1135
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:16,683
The girl possesses these qualities.

1136
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:19,308
With her indominable spirit

1137
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,476
...and pure competitive streak,

1138
00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:23,891
she too, has a chance of winning.

1139
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:26,559
Kazuha's spirits would be dampened
if she saw this.

1140
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:31,891
I'll make this brief,

1141
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:33,600
so bear with me.

1142
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:37,016
Darn it, it's almost time
for the lottery results.

1143
00:51:37,017 --> 00:51:39,475
So, what is it?

1144
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:42,516
It's regarding Yajima's murder.

1145
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,725
Wasn't that the work of a burglar?

1146
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,059
Was it really?

1147
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,600
According to my speculation,

1148
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:51,391
it was a planned murder commited
in cold blood.

1149
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:55,266
Ridiculous! Yajima wasn't a likeable person,
no doubt.

1150
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:58,141
But to suggest that someone hated him enough
to murder him, is just...

1151
00:51:58,142 --> 00:51:59,142
What about you?

1152
00:51:59,143 --> 00:52:00,516
Don't be stupid!

1153
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,392
Why would I...

1154
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:02,559
Sekine.

1155
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:06,391
You lost the Satsuki Cup
for two years running.

1156
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:09,476
And both times, you lost to Yajima.

1157
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:12,933
Let's say Yajima were to disappear.
You would then...

1158
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,641
Stop, stop. This is absurd.

1159
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:16,808
I want to win, obviously.

1160
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:20,808
But to kill my rival for that purpose?
It's ridiculous!

1161
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:24,058
Anyway, the police have classified
this case as burglary, so what's this about?!

1162
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,141
There are a few reasons.

1163
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,266
First of all,
ransacking is almost a given in a burglary.

1164
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,058
But in the case,

1165
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:35,059
the culprit did not touch anything
related to karuta.

1166
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:38,891
Could he have been in a hurry
to leave the murder scene?

1167
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:40,266
Indeed,

1168
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:41,808
but my speculation...

1169
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:45,350
is the culprit's emotional attachment
to things related to karuta,

1170
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:48,350
and an inherent inability to destroy them.

1171
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:51,891
Detectives really do
think of the oddest things.

1172
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:55,809
Well, speculate all you like.

1173
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:57,850
It has nothing to do with me.

1174
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:59,850
- Darn it.
- It has nothing to do with me.

1175
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:01,558
Ah, wait.

1176
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:02,517
What now?

1177
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:05,226
The annex's corridor has creaky flooring.

1178
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,433
It makes these creaky noises.
Do you remember that?

1179
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:09,933
And what about it?

1180
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:11,600
Given such a disturbance,

1181
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:15,016
Yajima would have realised
at once if someone entered the annex.

1182
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:17,975
But there were no signs
of dispute found on the body.

1183
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:18,976
I see.

1184
00:53:18,977 --> 00:53:20,350
I guess you're implying that

1185
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:22,600
the intruder was someone
Yajima was familiar with.

1186
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:23,850
Well, you're wrong.

1187
00:53:23,851 --> 00:53:27,766
Even during practice,
karuta requires intense concentration.

1188
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:31,351
The minute you start to focus,
you won't hear such noises.

1189
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:34,350
And that's why Yajima was never
aware of the intruder,

1190
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,600
and was killed.

1191
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:37,308
That is not possible.

1192
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:40,892
Yajima was dealt a fatal blow
to the centre of his head.

1193
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:45,891
If he had continued playing karuta
unaware that someone had entered,

1194
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:50,016
the wound would have been
to the back of his head, not the side.

1195
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:50,934
In other words,

1196
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:53,558
unless Yajima knew the culprit,

1197
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,016
such a blow would not have been possible.

1198
00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:59,933
The culprit
is someone well-versed in karuta,

1199
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:02,225
acquainted with Yajima and had no alibi
at the time of the crime.

1200
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:03,226
Not to mention also,

1201
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:05,726
this person would stand to gain
from Yajima's death.

1202
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:08,391
Well, how curious.

1203
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:09,684
Everything points to me.

1204
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:11,641
Then again,

1205
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:14,517
all that you have said
are mere speculations, no?

1206
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:18,267
In order to make me the culprit,
you need evidence.

1207
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,016
Sekine, time's up.

1208
00:54:21,017 --> 00:54:22,183
Please get ready.

1209
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:26,558
Okay, I'll be right there.
What a shame, it's time.

1210
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,309
Bye then.

1211
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,141
Just one last question.

1212
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,392
This is annoying. What?

1213
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,308
I can't quite get
this conversation out of my head.

1214
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:37,351
I'm not sure if you remember it, though.

1215
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:40,475
If the Satsuki Cup is called off

1216
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,600
because of Yajima's death,
he would have been beaten in vain.

1217
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:44,183
We'd all be ultimate losers!

1218
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:46,641
Indeed, I said that.

1219
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,933
Normally, upon knowing that
the murder weapon is a katana,

1220
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:51,558
one would think of slashing
and stabbing as the causes of death.

1221
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:54,476
Even so, you mentioned the phrase "beaten".

1222
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:57,725
Only the culprit would know
that the katana used for the murder was rusty

1223
00:54:57,726 --> 00:55:00,016
and therefore impossible to unsheath.

1224
00:55:00,017 --> 00:55:02,933
How did you know that
he was beaten to death?

1225
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:06,058
T-That's because I saw
the body at crime scene.

1226
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:07,017
Isn't it obvious?

1227
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:11,059
Just before you arrived,
the body was fully covered up.

1228
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:15,226
There was no way
you could have seen it up close.

1229
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:19,766
W-Well, somehow I did.

1230
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:24,516
Judging from the blood stains and stuff,
I concluded that he was beaten, okay?

1231
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:27,641
Whatever it is,
I have nothing to do with the murder!

1232
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,684
Seriously, how rude.

1233
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:33,725
Now, let's see how far he can go.

1234
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:35,808
All that's left...

1235
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:37,808
...is the tournament venue.

1236
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,975
Well,
judging from the interrogation just now,

1237
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:42,308
it looks like this case will be a handful.

1238
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:45,434
Gosh, this place is just huge.

1239
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,266
And what's that structure
in the middle of the cliff?

1240
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,766
That's Satsuki Hall.

1241
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:50,933
Satsuki?

1242
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:51,934
Yes.

1243
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:55,891
President Achiha had it built
in honour of his wife,

1244
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:57,891
hence the name.

1245
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:59,141
I see.

1246
00:55:59,142 --> 00:56:02,433
This cliff can be accessed only once a year.

1247
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:04,975
Moreover, the only ones allowed in the hall
are the karuta cards reader,

1248
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:07,100
President Achiha and the two finalists.

1249
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:09,141
The system is such that the match

1250
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:12,058
will be broadcast live across the river
to a spectator's area

1251
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:16,141
via cameras and microphone
within the competition venue.

1252
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:18,226
It's elaborate, to say the least.

1253
00:56:18,684 --> 00:56:21,641
In the competition venue,
the air conditioning system

1254
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:24,766
keeps the temperature
and humidity at a relative constant,

1255
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:29,516
and the building itself is using
the latest sound proofing technologies

1256
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:31,766
that completely blocks out
all external sounds.

1257
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:36,434
Indeed a venue created solely for karuta,
a pinnacle of competition venues...

1258
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,516
I'm hungry

1259
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:46,891
Let's go for a buffet

1260
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:48,808
I want cake

1261
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:51,183
I'll go for some sightseeing then.

1262
00:56:51,184 --> 00:56:52,641
Yeah. Have fun!

1263
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:53,642
Okay.

1264
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:54,808
Ran

1265
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:56,516
Let's go play

1266
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:57,766
Ah, see you later then!

1267
00:56:57,767 --> 00:56:58,392
Yeah.

1268
00:56:58,393 --> 00:56:59,725
Take care

1269
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:00,808
Sorry for the wait-

1270
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:02,767
The souvenirs are going to get sold out soon

1271
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:05,100
Let's resume practice

1272
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:06,850
Wait a moment.

1273
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,600
If you don't have some sleep,

1274
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:10,766
you're not going to last
till the actual competition.

1275
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,016
I'm fine!!

1276
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:14,225
D-Don't tell me, Kazuha!

1277
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:17,851
You are training with the former queen,
Shizuka san?

1278
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,933
That's right.

1279
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:22,308
Amazing! With this, maybe... maybe!

1280
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:25,975
Then, let's return to the room
and resume practice,

1281
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,516
If you really want to practice this much...

1282
00:57:28,517 --> 00:57:30,684
how about I be your opponent?

1283
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:34,976
I don't think this girl will be able to last
till the finals, either way.

1284
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:38,017
What did you say?!

1285
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:41,350
Kazuha, rest.

1286
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:42,184
Shizuka san...

1287
00:57:42,185 --> 00:57:43,767
I'll be your opponent.

1288
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:45,767
You dissatisfied with me as your opponent?

1289
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:48,808
Why would the former Queen,
Ikenami Shizuka san,

1290
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:50,600
for such a girl...

1291
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:53,766
With this, let's have a game

1292
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:55,725
If you say so...

1293
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:57,517
Please

1294
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,433
Where's Achiha san and Sekine san?

1295
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:08,308
It seems that after this,
they will be going to the competition

1296
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,142
venue Achiha Association Hall
to have a rehearsal for tomorrow.

1297
00:58:10,726 --> 00:58:12,891
They will be travelling
with the escort of the police,

1298
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:14,808
so there shouldn't be any worries there

1299
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:17,850
but the problem's, as expected,
after they enter the Achiha Association Hall.

1300
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:19,266
What about Ms. Momiji?

1301
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,433
Don't worry.

1302
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:23,892
That person lives in Kyoto too,
so everyone's travelling together.

1303
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,726
Sorry, it's a call.

1304
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:30,101
Regarding that man
in the photo you entrusted me with....

1305
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:31,933
I've found out his identity.

1306
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:33,683
What?! Really?

1307
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:36,100
Yeah. The content may be rather shocking...

1308
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:39,350
I've mailed you the details,
so do check it out later.

1309
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:40,309
Thank you!!

1310
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,891
And...
how is it going with the karuta cards?

1311
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:45,683
I've just transferred it
to the analysing software.

1312
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:46,933
As expected of the Professor.

1313
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:50,891
We should have the answer
in about an hour or so.

1314
00:58:50,892 --> 00:58:54,684
Great. Inform me as soon as possible
when the analysing is complete on your side!

1315
00:58:57,892 --> 00:58:59,101
Seriously...

1316
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:03,559
Nagoro Shikao...!!

1317
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:07,391
I have had fun for the first time
in a long while.

1318
00:59:07,392 --> 00:59:09,183
Thank you.

1319
00:59:09,184 --> 00:59:10,766
Shall we return, Iori?

1320
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:11,559
Yes.

1321
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,601
Even so, you sure have guts...

1322
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:16,683
Getting shocked by this level

1323
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:18,476
and entering the competition regardless...

1324
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:22,891
Remember this well. My name is Momiji!

1325
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,433
Unlike you, a mere leaf, I'm different!

1326
00:59:25,434 --> 00:59:26,850
Huh?! Leaf?!

1327
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:29,100
That's enough!

1328
00:59:29,101 --> 00:59:33,891
Even if my opponent is an amateur like you,
I will not hold back.

1329
00:59:33,892 --> 00:59:36,141
Afterall, I've let my guard down
beside another amateur in the past

1330
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,559
and experienced humiliating defeat.

1331
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,392
I don't want to experience
such regret ever again!

1332
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:45,601
Which if why if I'm going to do it,
I'll do it with full force at my best!

1333
00:59:45,851 --> 00:59:47,766
T-That's exactly what I expect!

1334
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:51,100
Well, let's put this karuta business aside.

1335
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:53,600
Are you sure it's fine for you to be here?

1336
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,975
The president would be worried, wouldn't he?

1337
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:59,891
Thank you for the concern.
That's right but I will be fine.

1338
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:02,141
Afterall, the famous detective of the West,

1339
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:04,891
Hattori Heiji, is with me...

1340
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,766
By that, what do you mean?

1341
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:12,101
Oh, haven't you heard of anything?
Heiji kun is my bodyguard.

1342
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:15,433
Yesterday too, without a wink of sleep,

1343
01:00:15,434 --> 01:00:18,476
he stood by the entrance of my house,
guarding me......

1344
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:21,850
Well, I'll be off soon.

1345
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,559
I'm looking forward
to the tournament tomorrow.

1346
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:26,934
Oh dear,

1347
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:29,141
it seems that there's more to Heiji
than it meets the eye, too...

1348
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:30,725
Wait a minute, Kazuha...

1349
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:31,517
Are you okay?

1350
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:32,766
Heiji!!

1351
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:35,725
I don't know what kind of relationship
you have with that girl

1352
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:38,725
but I'll give you a thorough beating
through the karuta tournament!

1353
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:41,101
Just you wait, Heiji!!

1354
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:44,601
Yes! Nicely put!

1355
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,808
What's up, Hattori?

1356
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,850
No, I'm not really sure but just now,

1357
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:52,433
I had the chills.

1358
01:00:52,434 --> 01:00:53,891
Caught a cold, maybe?

1359
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:56,891
The cold? It's not anything as cute as that...

1360
01:00:56,892 --> 01:00:59,392
Something more dreadful, perhaps...

1361
01:01:01,351 --> 01:01:02,809
Hey! It's here!

1362
01:01:03,684 --> 01:01:05,183
President Achiha...

1363
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:06,725
Ooka Momiji...

1364
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:07,975
And also Sekine...

1365
01:01:07,976 --> 01:01:09,517
Seems like everyone's here.

1366
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:31,851
Urgh, don't tell me?!

1367
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:34,851
Sekine's car is...

1368
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:42,141
So... how is Sekine's condition?

1369
01:01:42,142 --> 01:01:43,850
There was a call from the hospital.

1370
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:46,225
It seems like his consciousness
is not returning.

1371
01:01:46,226 --> 01:01:49,016
Whether he'll survive is a 50-50 battle...

1372
01:01:49,017 --> 01:01:53,516
Was Ooka kun,
who was caught in the explosion, fine?

1373
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:56,225
It seems that she did not suffer
from any injuries, but Just in case,

1374
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:58,391
we had her go through an examination

1375
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:00,891
at the hospital with Iori san,
who was driving.

1376
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:03,558
As it has boiled down to this,

1377
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:06,141
let's hear what you have to say
about the situation...

1378
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:07,642
Achiha san!

1379
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,475
The explosion at Nichiuri Televison...

1380
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,850
that too,
was aimed at the Satsuki Association

1381
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:15,476
which is what we think...

1382
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,184
Hey, old man...

1383
01:02:18,642 --> 01:02:20,684
This... Nagoro Shikao san, who's that?

1384
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:21,975
Little boy!!

1385
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,433
Where did you get that photo from?!

1386
01:02:23,434 --> 01:02:24,891
From this wavering...

1387
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,559
it seems that you have an idea?

1388
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,891
If you know him,

1389
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:30,683
mind telling us everything from the start?

1390
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:32,059
Achiha san!

1391
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,933
In Kyoto, there's a karuta association known

1392
01:02:35,934 --> 01:02:37,766
as the Nagoro Association...

1393
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:40,308
Made up of a small number of elitists,

1394
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:42,016
in an association with under 20 members,

1395
01:02:42,017 --> 01:02:44,559
they conducted tough trainings every month.

1396
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:48,601
Nagoro Shikao san was its leader.

1397
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:51,016
He had superb skills,

1398
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,933
and it was said that
he was close to obtaining the rights

1399
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:55,766
to challenge the current Master, yet...

1400
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:58,141
His obsession with winning was so strong,

1401
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:00,391
honestly, even just watching
from the sidelines

1402
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:02,684
it is difficult to say that
he played beautiful karuta.

1403
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:04,850
Hey! Darn it!

1404
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:06,766
I was faster just now!

1405
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:08,059
Give me that card!

1406
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:10,141
How was that a foul?

1407
01:03:10,142 --> 01:03:11,684
Where are you looking at?

1408
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:14,766
And Nagoro, 5 years ago,

1409
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:18,351
challenged the then-president,
Satsuki to a game

1410
01:03:18,851 --> 01:03:21,892
with the condition that
the loser disband his association.

1411
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:23,516
What's with that?

1412
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:25,183
He's out to destroy the association.

1413
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:26,850
But from Satsuki san's point of view,

1414
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,225
there was no need
to accept the challenge, is there?

1415
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:33,058
In order to prevent Satsuki
from rejecting his challenge,

1416
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,850
Nagoro kun leaked the information
to the media beforehand.

1417
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,100
Satsuki Association,
fearing the Nagoro Association,

1418
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:40,183
avoided the challenge.

1419
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:41,266
I see.

1420
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:43,225
So they were forced into a situation
where they couldn't do anything

1421
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:44,891
but to accept it.

1422
01:03:44,892 --> 01:03:47,766
So what happened to the match?

1423
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,517
The match did not take place.

1424
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:54,767
Nagoro did not appear
at the designated time.

1425
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:59,475
In the end it was taken as a forfeit,
and Satsuki became the winner.

1426
01:03:59,476 --> 01:04:03,933
Despite pulling the media in
and creating much commotion,

1427
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:08,933
he ran away on the day of the match itself
and disgraced the karuta community.

1428
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:11,516
He then disappeared
from the stage of karuta.

1429
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:15,600
So what happened to
Nagoro and the Nagoro Association?

1430
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,683
Nagoro Association was dissolved
due to the lack of a president,

1431
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:21,600
and Nagoro himself
remains missing till today.

1432
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:22,476
Don't tell me?!

1433
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:25,433
The case this time stems
from Nagoro Association's revenge

1434
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:27,016
against the Satsuki Association...

1435
01:04:27,017 --> 01:04:28,058
I don't know...

1436
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:29,266
Only, at that time,

1437
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:32,725
the one who pushed the dissolvement
of the Nagoro Association the most was

1438
01:04:32,726 --> 01:04:34,892
Yajima kun, who was murdered.

1439
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:36,516
What?! Really?

1440
01:04:36,517 --> 01:04:38,600
For us, the Satsuki Assocation,

1441
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:42,350
we seeked to avoid conflicts,
carrying on smoothly but...

1442
01:04:42,351 --> 01:04:43,933
even that was unfufilled...

1443
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:46,641
So, what happened to the members
of the dissolved Nagoro Association?

1444
01:04:46,642 --> 01:04:47,642
Of course,

1445
01:04:47,643 --> 01:04:50,850
we made it such that if they wanted to,

1446
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,350
they could have joined
the Satsuki Association.

1447
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,891
Eventually, two joined, though...

1448
01:04:53,892 --> 01:04:56,017
No way those two were...

1449
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,516
Ah... It's Ooka kun and Sekine kun.

1450
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:02,641
Two people who were caught
in the explosion just now?

1451
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:04,891
Yes. Ooka kun, especially,

1452
01:05:04,892 --> 01:05:08,016
inherited lots of techniques
through Nagoro kun,

1453
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:09,725
polishing her skills...

1454
01:05:09,726 --> 01:05:12,225
A few of her best cards
were exactly that of Nagoro's.

1455
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:15,975
In fact, the six cards
which paint pictures of autumn leaves,

1456
01:05:15,976 --> 01:05:18,058
both of them never did let escape.

1457
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,309
She is indeed someone
who can be said to be Nagoro's best disciple.

1458
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:24,726
Why did Nagoro's strongest cards
included autumn leaves?

1459
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:28,558
I heard it's due to his name being Shikao.

1460
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,641
Deer meat, huh...

1461
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:32,476
That's right,
we call deer meat "momiji" too, don't we?

1462
01:05:33,017 --> 01:05:35,600
The disciple he doted
on joining the Satsuki Association

1463
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:37,475
and doing very well there

1464
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:40,266
probably displeased him quite a bit

1465
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:42,850
That may be right

1466
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,183
but what's the point

1467
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:47,558
of sending an explosion notice all the way
at this point of time?

1468
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:51,600
We don't know the reason
why he kept silent for 5 years, too.

1469
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:54,391
Perhaps that mail containing
the explosion notice

1470
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:56,267
was to draw attention to his own return?

1471
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:59,183
Which means that,
for this string of incidents,

1472
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:00,433
we should investigate along the lines

1473
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:03,767
of the revenge of Nagoro Shikao
against the Satsuki Association...

1474
01:06:05,642 --> 01:06:06,976
Pardon me.

1475
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:08,766
What? Yes, yes.

1476
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,183
It'd be easier to establish a common

1477
01:06:10,184 --> 01:06:13,351
investigation unit
with the Kyoto Prefectural Police, it seems.

1478
01:06:13,976 --> 01:06:15,392
What did you say?!

1479
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:18,725
Chief!
After investigating Sekine san's phone,

1480
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:21,766
it seems that a strange mail was received
just moments before the explosion!

1481
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:23,100
Strange mail?!

1482
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:24,850
The sender is unknown,

1483
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:28,600
only an attachment file with a karuta card.

1484
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:30,184
What does the karuta card say?!

1485
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:35,058
"This time around, couldn't even bring
the sacred streamers, Offering Hill."

1486
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,975
"But if this brocade of leaves,
is to the gods' liking."

1487
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:39,642
That's Nagoro's forte card!!

1488
01:06:41,892 --> 01:06:43,433
What's the matter, Hei chan?

1489
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:44,851
There's something
I have to confirm right away!

1490
01:06:45,476 --> 01:06:47,017
Momiji is in danger!!

1491
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,142
Lori san?

1492
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:52,391
That voice, Hattori sama I suppose?

1493
01:06:52,392 --> 01:06:53,725
Yeah. Quick,

1494
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:58,058
check if Momiji's phone had received an email
from an unknown sender!

1495
01:06:58,059 --> 01:06:58,976
An email?

1496
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,309
What's the matter, Iori?

1497
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,433
Hattori sama is on the line.

1498
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:04,601
From Heiji kun!?

1499
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:06,184
Let me speak to him, Iori!!

1500
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,683
Momiji? Check your email right away

1501
01:07:09,684 --> 01:07:12,101
Email... Why all of a sudden...

1502
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:13,600
That aside,

1503
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:16,559
I'm so happy to receive a call from you,
Heiji kun!!

1504
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:19,517
Oh!? What's with this email...

1505
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:21,391
There's only an attachment file...

1506
01:07:21,392 --> 01:07:22,891
Is it a picture of a karuta card?!

1507
01:07:22,892 --> 01:07:25,141
Wow! How did you know that?

1508
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,808
Which poem is it! Read it out for me!!

1509
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,351
Um, okay...

1510
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:30,850
"It's the autumn leaves
of the hills of Mimuro,"

1511
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,433
"where the tempests blow..."

1512
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:34,141
Momiji!! Hey listen!!

1513
01:07:34,142 --> 01:07:36,558
Do not stay alone tonight!!

1514
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:37,725
Don't go back home either!!

1515
01:07:37,726 --> 01:07:39,766
Come over to
Osaka Prefectural Police immediately!

1516
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:40,808
Got it?!

1517
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,516
I cannot listen to that

1518
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:43,934
even if it is a request coming from you,
Heiji kun.

1519
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,225
In order to prepare
for tomorrow's Satsuki Cup, I cannot.

1520
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:48,975
This isn't the time to be saying that!

1521
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:50,767
There's a chance that
you are being targeted!!

1522
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:53,183
I'll be fine.

1523
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:55,433
Because Heiji kun will be there for me.

1524
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:58,267
You will keep me safe, won't you?

1525
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:02,391
Because I haven't forgotten that promise...

1526
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:03,933
Promise?!

1527
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:05,309
See you

1528
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:08,891
That idiot, she hung up...

1529
01:08:08,892 --> 01:08:12,476
It seems that she received the karuta email
as well huh...

1530
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:13,767
Otaki!!

1531
01:08:13,768 --> 01:08:16,725
Strengthen Ooka Momiji's
police escort immediately

1532
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:17,851
Yes sir!!

1533
01:08:19,392 --> 01:08:23,516
Which means Yajima san is the only one
who was murdered without prior warning...

1534
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:25,558
There was message about a karuta card

1535
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,350
at Yajima san's murder scene as well,
wasn't there?

1536
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:30,808
So that means... the real culprit Nagoro,

1537
01:08:30,809 --> 01:08:32,933
after murdering Yajima san...

1538
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:36,475
left behind his own forte card
before leaving the scene,

1539
01:08:36,476 --> 01:08:40,559
but Sekine came after
and disguised his work even further!

1540
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:42,016
I see...

1541
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,850
so through the message that
was left behind at the crime scene,

1542
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,850
Sekine confirmed that
the murderer was Nagoro,

1543
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:50,433
and in order to conceal
his former master's crime,

1544
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:53,266
he ransacked the house to make
it look like it was robbed...

1545
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:54,267
So you're saying that

1546
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:58,058
Sekine kun got to the crime scene
before the police?

1547
01:08:58,059 --> 01:09:00,808
Yeah. That possibility is quite high...

1548
01:09:00,809 --> 01:09:04,725
Actually,
I got someone to analyze the crime scene

1549
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:07,433
From the way the blood
got onto the karuta cards...

1550
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,226
Alright!!

1551
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:12,600
we should be able to figure out
how they were lined up during the murder...

1552
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:13,851
Look at the Television

1553
01:09:14,226 --> 01:09:15,226
On the right hand side,

1554
01:09:15,227 --> 01:09:18,183
the cards that were stained
with Yajima san's blood

1555
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:19,558
as they were left on the floor...

1556
01:09:19,559 --> 01:09:22,516
then... the clean cards
on the left hand side and,

1557
01:09:22,517 --> 01:09:26,558
the cards that became covered in blood
as they were mixed together afterwards...

1558
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:29,433
And then, judging from the slight

1559
01:09:29,434 --> 01:09:31,308
distortion in the way
the blood was transferred,

1560
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:33,684
the card that
Yajima san was made to hold is...

1561
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:36,016
Number 32!!

1562
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:37,809
Harumichi no Tsuraki...

1563
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:42,016
"A wattle dam, laid seemingly by the wind,
across the mountain stream."

1564
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:44,476
"Autumn leaves trapped in the current,
unable to work themselves free."

1565
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:45,851
Just as I thought,

1566
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:49,183
Nagoro's forte card was there
at Yajima san's place.

1567
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,266
Look at this.

1568
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:52,184
These are the cards that have been used
in the crimes at this point.

1569
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:55,559
From the top left
there's Nichiuri Television,

1570
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:57,434
Yajima san,

1571
01:09:58,267 --> 01:09:59,517
Sekine san,

1572
01:10:00,184 --> 01:10:02,559
followed by Momiji san
which was just identified earlier...

1573
01:10:03,226 --> 01:10:05,350
What these cards have in common is the

1574
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:06,642
inclusion of the words
"momiji" (autumn leaves)...

1575
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:10,725
I thought so,
these are all Nagoro's forte cards...

1576
01:10:10,726 --> 01:10:11,601
Yea

1577
01:10:11,602 --> 01:10:13,100
I guess this means that

1578
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:16,309
there's no mistake in looking
at Nagoro Shikao as the true culprit.

1579
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:19,558
I suspected as much but......

1580
01:10:19,559 --> 01:10:21,850
to think that
it really is Nagoro kun's doing...

1581
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:22,851
What's worrying is that,

1582
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:26,308
so far the cards all have portrayals
of scenes with autumn leaves,

1583
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:28,766
and in total
there are six of such cards in karuta.

1584
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:30,016
What are you getting at?

1585
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,976
It means that there are still
two more cards left.

1586
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:35,600
If he is trying to appeal his own crimes
by using karuta cards,

1587
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:40,684
then he wouldn't leave things unfinished
by leaving out two cards now, would he?

1588
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:43,308
Don't tell me,
there are others besides Ooka kun

1589
01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:46,641
The question is who are the targets
for the remaining 2 cards...

1590
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,891
If we don't identify them quickly...

1591
01:10:47,892 --> 01:10:50,641
it will be difficult
to prevent Nagoro's crime...

1592
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:52,350
As expected. If it's you guys,

1593
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:55,475
it is likely that you'd be able
to stop Nagoro kun before the police can.

1594
01:10:55,476 --> 01:10:59,184
Yeah. But for that, we need more information.

1595
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:02,808
Hey, what happened
between you and Nagoro san 5 years ago?

1596
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,058
Well, that's...

1597
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,725
There was something right?

1598
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:07,476
I'm not letting you deny
that nothing's happened!!

1599
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,516
You're right...

1600
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:10,933
I couldn't say anything before,

1601
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,559
but if it's you guys I guess it's fine...

1602
01:11:12,809 --> 01:11:15,683
Come over to my hotel room after this.

1603
01:11:15,684 --> 01:11:19,059
I'll talk in detail about
what happened that day.

1604
01:11:20,892 --> 01:11:22,975
Everyone, wait a moment okay.

1605
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:24,975
I'm going to pass this to Momiji san.

1606
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:26,433
- Okay!
- We'll be waiting!

1607
01:11:26,434 --> 01:11:27,267
Roger!

1608
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:28,767
My lady.

1609
01:11:28,768 --> 01:11:31,225
There was a call from the police earlier.

1610
01:11:31,226 --> 01:11:33,392
It is regarding additional police protection
around the house.

1611
01:11:33,684 --> 01:11:35,433
Okay. Go ahead.

1612
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:36,642
Excuse me...

1613
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:38,308
You must be Momiji san, right?

1614
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:40,017
My name is Mouri, I contacted you earlier.

1615
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:42,683
Oh... it was you.

1616
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:46,141
Thank you very much
for coming all the way here to return it.

1617
01:11:46,142 --> 01:11:47,766
Not at all. Here.

1618
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:50,641
This belongs to you, right?

1619
01:11:50,642 --> 01:11:52,683
Oh my!! Thank you!

1620
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,391
This is sort of like
a good luck charm of mine.

1621
01:11:55,392 --> 01:11:58,391
I was wondering how tomorrow's match
will go without this,

1622
01:11:58,392 --> 01:12:00,226
but now I'm sure I'll be alright somehow.

1623
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:01,933
Perhaps to you

1624
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:05,391
it would be like sending salt to the enemy,
wouldn't it?

1625
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:06,559
Not at all.

1626
01:12:07,226 --> 01:12:08,226
That girl...

1627
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:10,851
I hoped she practiced until her fingers hurt

1628
01:12:11,309 --> 01:12:12,725
What pretty nails.

1629
01:12:12,726 --> 01:12:16,017
Oh, these are for protecting my fingers.

1630
01:12:16,434 --> 01:12:18,641
One's fingers are one's life in karuta,

1631
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:21,266
that's why I always have it
on outside of practice.

1632
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:22,766
I see.

1633
01:12:22,767 --> 01:12:24,016
Oh... and...

1634
01:12:24,017 --> 01:12:26,851
I wanted to know who to contact
so I ended up looking inside...

1635
01:12:27,934 --> 01:12:29,767
And then... in the picture...

1636
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:32,434
You mean this picture?

1637
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,808
This person here in the picture is...

1638
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,183
It's Heiji kun.

1639
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:38,350
I thought so...

1640
01:12:38,351 --> 01:12:41,100
This was from a karuta competition
when we were kids,

1641
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:44,183
when I lost to Heiji kun...

1642
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:47,892
Heiji kun said to me as I was crying
after I had lost...

1643
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:51,808
Don't cry...

1644
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:55,142
The next time we meet,
I'll take you as my wife so just you wait!!

1645
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:57,267
R Really?

1646
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:58,892
Yeah...

1647
01:12:59,434 --> 01:13:00,809
It's a promise...

1648
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:04,141
So he really proposed?!

1649
01:13:04,142 --> 01:13:07,350
And that's why,
Heiji kun is my future husband.

1650
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:10,225
But, considering that
you were still kids at the time...

1651
01:13:10,226 --> 01:13:12,225
It doesn't matter
if you're a child or an adult!!

1652
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:15,725
Once a man says something,
he shouldn't turn on it that easily.

1653
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:16,976
Am I wrong?

1654
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:21,726
To be able to read the thoughts
of the girl you love is really something

1655
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:24,100
I guess so...

1656
01:13:24,101 --> 01:13:25,683
Because the current is swift,
even though the rapids,

1657
01:13:25,684 --> 01:13:28,308
blocked by a boulder are divided,
like them, in the end,

1658
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:30,642
we will surely meet, I know.

1659
01:13:31,476 --> 01:13:32,892
Though we are apart,

1660
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:35,642
as long as our hearts are connected...

1661
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:37,976
Despite having believed in that I...

1662
01:13:39,351 --> 01:13:41,183
Please tell this to Happa chan...

1663
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:42,726
H Happa chan?

1664
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:46,433
I won't let anyone have the cards
that I am targeting.

1665
01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:48,059
I was taught as such by my teacher.

1666
01:13:49,309 --> 01:13:50,767
Momiji san...

1667
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:52,476
Ran!!

1668
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,308
What are you spacing out for?

1669
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:56,933
You've been a little off

1670
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,641
ever since you can back
from sightseeing in Osaka.

1671
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,891
Sorry...

1672
01:13:59,892 --> 01:14:01,516
That aside, how's everything going?

1673
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:03,808
Well...

1674
01:14:03,809 --> 01:14:05,975
I was given some homework by Shizuka san

1675
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:09,059
to pick out my forte cards
in order to win but...

1676
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:12,142
I can't seem to settle
on one card over another...

1677
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:14,559
Is that troubling you so much?

1678
01:14:15,642 --> 01:14:18,433
Hyakunen Isshu are love poems, aren't they?

1679
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,766
Instead of thinking about winning,

1680
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:22,433
I think that if you stay true
to your own feelings

1681
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:23,851
you will be able
to choose pretty quickly...

1682
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:25,976
Love huh...

1683
01:14:26,601 --> 01:14:29,476
If it were me... I think I'd go with this...

1684
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:31,850
As I was wondering,
whether or not I had seen it by chance.

1685
01:14:31,851 --> 01:14:33,392
Murasaki Shikibu

1686
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:36,266
It's a poem about finally
being able to meet a friend,

1687
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:38,100
but who is gone in a fleeting moment...

1688
01:14:38,101 --> 01:14:42,641
Yes. He goes off somewhere the moment
I thought I'd finally get to see him...

1689
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:45,308
Even though there is so much
I want to talk about...

1690
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:47,226
I see... In that case

1691
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:50,017
I shall go with...

1692
01:14:51,976 --> 01:14:56,725
"Even though I hide it, it shows
all over my face, such is my longing."

1693
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:59,517
"So that people ask me
âWhat are you thinking about?â"

1694
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:02,433
A love poem about being unable
to completely conceal one's feelings,

1695
01:15:02,434 --> 01:15:03,892
this might be perfect for you...

1696
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:06,641
Though,
it'll also be obvious to Momiji san as well.

1697
01:15:06,642 --> 01:15:09,351
Anyway, I wonder how she can be
so full of confidence.

1698
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:12,267
As though she's already engaged to Heiji.

1699
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,600
Don't you think so as well?

1700
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:15,767
Y Yeah...

1701
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,516
I can't tell her that

1702
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:22,059
Hattori kun proposed to Momiji san
when they were kids...

1703
01:15:23,684 --> 01:15:24,642
What?

1704
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:28,225
Nagoro came to challenge Satsuki san
the day before the match!?

1705
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:29,350
Is that really true?

1706
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:32,141
Yeah. It happened while I was away...

1707
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:33,350
The article in that scrapbook,
Even though it was recorded that

1708
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:37,725
Nagoro kun ran away from the match
against Satsuki because he was afraid...

1709
01:15:37,726 --> 01:15:40,183
the truth is that
he actually came by the day before.

1710
01:15:40,184 --> 01:15:41,975
But why the day before?

1711
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:42,767
I don't know...

1712
01:15:42,768 --> 01:15:45,516
You wouldn't know why
unless you asked Nagoro himself,

1713
01:15:45,517 --> 01:15:46,558
but perhaps his intention was

1714
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,475
to use Satsuki Association's karuta cards
to win,

1715
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:52,558
at least that was what Satsuki had said...

1716
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:54,391
Well did he use them?

1717
01:15:54,392 --> 01:15:56,558
But Satsuki Association's karuta cards

1718
01:15:56,559 --> 01:15:58,892
are normally kept in the museum, aren't they?

1719
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:04,058
There wasn't any case of theft at the time.
They were indeed in our custody.

1720
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,141
But without the reader
the match couldn't have happened, could it?

1721
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:10,433
There're plenty of cassette tapes
on the shelf right?

1722
01:16:10,434 --> 01:16:14,350
A long time ago people used those
to practice karuta.

1723
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:16,433
And so, how'd the match go?

1724
01:16:16,434 --> 01:16:18,476
The result was a complete victory
for Satsuki.

1725
01:16:19,059 --> 01:16:21,850
Apparently Nagoro couldn't even
move his hands or feet...

1726
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:23,433
I returned home

1727
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:25,975
just as he dashed out
of the doorstep pale faced,

1728
01:16:25,976 --> 01:16:28,726
I remember him leaving
as though he was running away.

1729
01:16:29,309 --> 01:16:32,433
That was the last I ever saw of him.

1730
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:35,517
Why didn't you tell this to the police?

1731
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:37,975
I was afraid that it would leak to the media

1732
01:16:37,976 --> 01:16:39,851
and Association members if I had done so.

1733
01:16:39,976 --> 01:16:41,850
Regardless of the significance
of the karuta that was used,

1734
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:44,808
if it were known that
they had been used for some personal contest,

1735
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,558
there would have been a revolt
amongst the Association members.

1736
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:50,641
Well, I guess that excuse isn't
completely unrelatable but...

1737
01:16:50,642 --> 01:16:53,975
It wasn't that I didn't trust the police...

1738
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,016
- It looks as if Nagoro kun had the upper hand...
- There's something out of place about this picture...

1739
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,350
- You guys are the only ones I can count on.
- Achiha san's car is really something...

1740
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:01,641
- In order to prevent any more casualties...
- Achiha san's car is really something...

1741
01:17:01,642 --> 01:17:04,641
please stop Nagoro's crimes
as soon as possible.

1742
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:06,309
Yeah, leave it to us!!

1743
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:10,767
Ran chan, two isn't enough.

1744
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,892
Can you put in another two for me?

1745
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:15,975
My brain needs some sugar.

1746
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:18,684
O Okay. Were you... able to hear that?

1747
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:20,559
...This girl...

1748
01:17:21,226 --> 01:17:22,226
This is really bad...

1749
01:17:22,227 --> 01:17:23,891
I still can't use the kakoi te
and watari te well enough,

1750
01:17:23,892 --> 01:17:26,601
and I can't read the flow
of the game as well!

1751
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,517
At this rate...

1752
01:17:28,892 --> 01:17:31,808
Heiji...
Heiji will be taken away by that her.

1753
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:33,142
What's wrong Kazuha?

1754
01:17:33,434 --> 01:17:35,058
Making a scary face like that...

1755
01:17:35,059 --> 01:17:37,433
H Heiji!!

1756
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:39,016
Did you have a fight with someone?

1757
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:40,433
Oh shut up, you idiot!!

1758
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:42,975
You're that person's bodyguard right?

1759
01:17:42,976 --> 01:17:44,433
Go back to her then!

1760
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:45,434
Hey...

1761
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:47,975
I just thought
I'd take a break from that old lady

1762
01:17:47,976 --> 01:17:49,975
and have a game with you...

1763
01:17:49,976 --> 01:17:52,350
You know,
I've never lost a game of karuta to you...

1764
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,641
That was back in elementary school!

1765
01:17:54,642 --> 01:17:56,558
You wouldn't stand a chance against me now!

1766
01:17:56,559 --> 01:17:57,933
Hey Hattori kun.

1767
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:59,516
Don't you remember anything

1768
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:02,516
from that karuta competition you were in
back in elementary school?

1769
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:05,641
Like say, a girl whom you beat at
during that competition...

1770
01:18:05,642 --> 01:18:07,933
Oh yeah! That's it! Kazuha!

1771
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:09,558
It was back during that karuta competition!

1772
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:12,475
The one which you joined on the spur
of the moment and won?

1773
01:18:12,476 --> 01:18:14,516
Yeah. At that time, there was a girl who lost

1774
01:18:14,517 --> 01:18:16,558
and was crying really badly right?

1775
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,851
That was Ooka Momiji!

1776
01:18:19,309 --> 01:18:20,516
I see! That girl...!

1777
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:22,933
And so... Hattori kun, don't you remember?

1778
01:18:22,934 --> 01:18:23,809
About?

1779
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,891
Say, a promise you made
with Momiji san at the time...

1780
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:30,308
I think I said something
like try harder next time...

1781
01:18:30,309 --> 01:18:31,934
Anyway Heiji, you better hurry back!

1782
01:18:32,517 --> 01:18:34,808
You have to keep her safe right?

1783
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:36,141
Oh, the police are on that...

1784
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:37,309
Oh just go already!

1785
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:39,726
If she gets hurt before the competition...

1786
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:42,226
we wouldn't be able to have our match...

1787
01:18:43,434 --> 01:18:46,141
I see...
In that case I'll be on my way then...

1788
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:47,017
Mom!

1789
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:48,476
I'll leave the rest to you!

1790
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:55,101
"Even though I hide it,
it shows all over my face."

1791
01:18:56,101 --> 01:19:00,059
"Such is my longing,
so that people ask me..."

1792
01:19:05,726 --> 01:19:07,017
Nagoro sensei...

1793
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:11,184
Please lend me your strength
this year as well...

1794
01:19:17,642 --> 01:19:19,309
Please watch over me.

1795
01:19:20,142 --> 01:19:21,559
Satsuki.

1797
01:19:29,851 --> 01:19:34,225
(Achiha Kaikan)
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms,

1798
01:19:34,226 --> 01:19:37,267
But for winter.

1799
01:19:39,226 --> 01:19:46,434
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.

1800
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:52,100
Here comes spring,

1801
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:56,767
now the flower blooms

1802
01:20:02,892 --> 01:20:05,058
Kazuha oneesan She got it!!

1803
01:20:05,059 --> 01:20:07,058
She's really in a different league
from the others.

1804
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:08,475
You could tell that right away.

1805
01:20:08,476 --> 01:20:09,142
Yea.

1806
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:12,350
- That's... an Aikido uniform right?
- I wish Conan were here to see this...

1807
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:13,975
It can't be helped.

1808
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:17,016
It seems he had to go somewhere
with Heiji oniisan.

1809
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:18,100
Ah! That's right.

1810
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:20,308
I'll send Conan kun
that picture of Genta kun

1811
01:20:20,309 --> 01:20:22,183
we took over
at the souvenir shop a while ago

1812
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,642
Yes, I knew that.

1813
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:28,600
Looks like it has started...

1814
01:20:28,601 --> 01:20:29,392
Yeah.

1815
01:20:29,393 --> 01:20:31,475
Well if the security is this perfect,

1816
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:33,475
I figure even Nagoro
wouldn't be able to get in

1817
01:20:33,476 --> 01:20:35,808
Yeah. Including Nagoro...

1818
01:20:35,809 --> 01:20:38,308
anyone who did not register
as a staff beforehand

1819
01:20:38,309 --> 01:20:40,684
- will not be allowed in.
- This way.

1820
01:20:41,309 --> 01:20:43,725
Background checks had been flawless as well.

1821
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:46,059
Yeah. We're not going
to let Nagoro do as he pleases.

1822
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,267
What's the matter Hattori?

1823
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,976
Nah, it's nothing.

1824
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:52,642
Who's this?

1825
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:55,101
Oh, it's just Mitsuhiko...

1826
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,850
Oh man, what is that Genta doing...

1827
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:00,142
grabbing on to so much senmaizuke at once...

1828
01:21:01,476 --> 01:21:02,767
I see...

1829
01:21:08,726 --> 01:21:11,892
(MAP)

1830
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:18,976
(Firing Alarm System)

1831
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,267
As expected!
The first one to finish is Momiji!

1832
01:21:30,726 --> 01:21:32,141
Where is Kazuha?

1833
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,725
I think she hasn't showed up yet.

1834
01:21:33,726 --> 01:21:35,475
Isn't that her?

1835
01:21:35,476 --> 01:21:37,558
Yes, it's Kazuha!

1836
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,850
Yes!!

1837
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,683
Way to go! Kazuha chan!

1838
01:21:40,684 --> 01:21:44,351
She's gotten through the first round,
what a good start...

1839
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:53,184
Sekine san? Sekine san!!

1840
01:22:38,226 --> 01:22:39,726
Thank you very much.

1841
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:42,100
Who would've thought that
she'd make it to the finals...

1842
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:45,726
Yes. What a surprise
to find someone with such level of skill...

1843
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:50,891
You think she can win?

1844
01:22:50,892 --> 01:22:52,017
Of course!!

1845
01:22:52,517 --> 01:22:55,517
Way to go, Kazuha!
At this rate you're gonna win!!

1846
01:22:56,017 --> 01:22:57,809
I wonder if Kazuha chan realizes that...

1847
01:22:58,059 --> 01:23:02,601
If Momiji san wins,
she's going to confess to Heiji kun.

1848
01:23:03,184 --> 01:23:04,725
She's trying hard...

1849
01:23:04,726 --> 01:23:05,642
Kazuha...

1850
01:23:05,643 --> 01:23:07,766
Looks like she's finally
going up against Momiji san.

1851
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:08,767
Yeah...

1852
01:23:08,768 --> 01:23:09,892
What?!

1853
01:23:10,101 --> 01:23:12,308
Sekine san regained consciousness?

1854
01:23:12,309 --> 01:23:15,517
Ah, I see... that's the way it is huh...

1855
01:23:15,976 --> 01:23:16,851
Understood.

1856
01:23:16,852 --> 01:23:18,266
I'll leave things here
to Kyoto Prefectural Police

1857
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:19,433
and head over right away.

1858
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:21,183
Has Sekine san woken up?

1859
01:23:21,184 --> 01:23:22,475
Yeah.

1860
01:23:22,476 --> 01:23:25,225
Also it seems that Hei chan's deductions
were on the mark.

1861
01:23:25,226 --> 01:23:28,225
But why was Sekine san over
at Yajima san's place?

1862
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:32,808
It seems that lately,
Yajima san has been looking up on Nagoro...

1863
01:23:32,809 --> 01:23:34,600
Realizing that Sekine san thought that

1864
01:23:34,601 --> 01:23:39,933
keeping watch on Yajima san
would lead him to his former master...

1865
01:23:39,934 --> 01:23:43,016
But later, having sensed something was amiss

1866
01:23:43,017 --> 01:23:44,641
he found Yajima's body...

1867
01:23:44,642 --> 01:23:45,808
I'm afraid so...

1868
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:50,225
I'm heading back to Osaka
to question Sekine san directly

1869
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:53,350
Understood. Please leave things here to us.

1870
01:23:53,351 --> 01:23:54,101
Sure.

1871
01:23:54,102 --> 01:23:56,476
Ah! Hold on, I'm going with...

1872
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:02,017
This ends here...

1873
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:04,308
Though, why is there dynamite here?

1874
01:24:04,309 --> 01:24:07,059
There wasn't any need to set up...

1875
01:24:07,559 --> 01:24:08,434
What?! No?!

1876
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:12,225
- Hey, what is that smoke?
- A fire?

1877
01:24:12,226 --> 01:24:14,641
No, a fire would've
triggered the fire alarm system...

1878
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:15,725
I couldn't have been an explosive,
could it...

1879
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:17,142
Hey hey this isn't funny.

1880
01:24:17,726 --> 01:24:19,601
Something's causing a commotion.

1881
01:24:20,392 --> 01:24:22,266
Hey! Is there something
in the forest to the west?!

1882
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,558
O Over there there's...
only an old storage pen.

1883
01:24:25,559 --> 01:24:27,266
The security cameras,
did they pick up anything?

1884
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:29,683
That location is outside the facility
so there aren't any cameras.

1885
01:24:29,684 --> 01:24:30,892
What?!

1886
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,516
Oi! Don't tell me that smoke is...

1887
01:24:33,517 --> 01:24:34,809
Ah, let's go!!

1888
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:42,851
It's Satsuki Hall, that's where we're headed.

1889
01:24:46,142 --> 01:24:48,058
What is this smell?

1890
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:51,933
Recently the elevator has been
under maintenance

1891
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:54,516
so the smell is probably coming
from the lubricating oil that was used...

1892
01:24:54,517 --> 01:24:55,517
Does it bother you?

1893
01:24:55,518 --> 01:24:57,850
Oh no, no at all.

1894
01:24:57,851 --> 01:24:59,558
I must be a little on edge.

1895
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:02,684
This is so exciting, how do you feel?

1896
01:25:03,309 --> 01:25:07,266
I didn't think
I'd really make it all the way here

1897
01:25:07,267 --> 01:25:08,516
so I'm excited

1898
01:25:08,517 --> 01:25:09,601
but it's a little different for you,
isn't it?

1899
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:12,684
Not at all, I feel as though my heart
might spring out of my mouth.

1900
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,141
I wonder

1901
01:25:16,142 --> 01:25:19,726
how my dear Heiji kun's reaction will be like
when I finally confess to him...

1902
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:24,142
I won't lose.
I cannot lose, no matter what...

1903
01:25:25,934 --> 01:25:28,100
You cannot get any closer!

1904
01:25:28,101 --> 01:25:29,266
What in the world happened here?

1905
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,309
Inspector!!

1906
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:31,891
Was it really blown up?

1907
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:33,975
Yes. There is one victim.

1908
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:35,933
The body was badly disfigured...

1909
01:25:35,934 --> 01:25:38,766
It's not possible
to identify the victim right away.

1910
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:40,225
I see...

1911
01:25:40,226 --> 01:25:42,016
The question is when, and how

1912
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,850
Looks like bomb was set up here...

1913
01:25:43,851 --> 01:25:45,516
And, based on the circumstance

1914
01:25:45,517 --> 01:25:47,808
it is also possible that
the victim was carrying the bomb...

1915
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:48,809
What?!

1916
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,350
Could it be that
Nagoro had the wrong target?

1917
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:51,850
Retrieve the body immediately
and start an autopsy.

1918
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:52,934
Yes sir.

1919
01:25:55,267 --> 01:25:57,101
Inspector Ootaki, what happened?

1920
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:00,934
What's the matter, Kudo?

1921
01:26:01,059 --> 01:26:03,350
Hattori, look at that.

1922
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:04,600
What is this?

1923
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:05,392
A ring?

1924
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,226
Yeah, possibly the victim's...

1925
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:09,725
Both of you, what's wrong?

1926
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:12,558
Look at this ring.
It could be a lost article.

1927
01:26:12,559 --> 01:26:14,433
What a burly ring...

1928
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:16,975
Yeah, judging from the size it may not...

1929
01:26:16,976 --> 01:26:18,851
A huge ring... Wait a second...

1930
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:22,726
Kaieda Tougo!!

1931
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:26,309
Kaieda? Isn't that
Achiha san's secretary (bodyguard)?

1932
01:26:26,684 --> 01:26:28,141
Yeah. There's no mistake.

1933
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:31,391
This ring was worn by Kaieda on his thumb.

1934
01:26:31,392 --> 01:26:34,058
That means...
that Kaieda guy is the real culprit!!

1935
01:26:34,059 --> 01:26:34,851
No...

1936
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:36,975
If we didn't find this ring,

1937
01:26:36,976 --> 01:26:40,516
that body over there might've been
mistakenly identified as Nagoro's...

1938
01:26:40,517 --> 01:26:41,267
Which means...

1939
01:26:41,268 --> 01:26:44,851
This explosion was set up
as a ploy to stage Nagoro's death...

1940
01:26:45,726 --> 01:26:46,642
Hold on.

1941
01:26:46,643 --> 01:26:49,808
Assuming that Nagoro is dead at this point,

1942
01:26:49,809 --> 01:26:52,183
doesn't that means that
the two remaining karuta cards

1943
01:26:52,184 --> 01:26:54,683
have already been sent?

1944
01:26:54,684 --> 01:26:56,058
Not two.

1945
01:26:56,059 --> 01:26:58,850
I got a call from Ootaki earlier,

1946
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:03,391
we got President Achiha's secretary
to verify his email

1947
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:06,350
and apparently he received
a karuta email this morning.

1948
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:09,516
That means there's only one card left...

1949
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:11,766
- One card remaining...
- No way!? All that's left are finals before everything's over.

1950
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:13,642
- and the finals...
- Is something about to happen again?

1951
01:27:14,267 --> 01:27:15,309
I see!!

1952
01:27:15,809 --> 01:27:20,101
Since Achiha san's received the email,
that means there is one target left.

1953
01:27:20,642 --> 01:27:23,225
And the killer would made his move

1954
01:27:23,226 --> 01:27:24,892
after the card has been decided
at the finals.

1955
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,101
Don't tell me?!

1956
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:29,225
Inspector!!
Check Toyama Kazuha's phone right away!!

1957
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:30,516
G Got it...

1958
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:32,308
But why is this happening?

1959
01:27:32,309 --> 01:27:35,475
Why is the last card being left out?

1960
01:27:35,476 --> 01:27:36,351
That's because,

1961
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:38,892
the person to receive it
wasn't decided until the finals!

1962
01:27:40,017 --> 01:27:41,892
Don't tell me,
the target is at the finals venue...

1963
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:44,976
Satsuki Hall,
where the three of them are gathered!

1964
01:27:45,476 --> 01:27:47,101
Apologies to the both of you

1965
01:27:48,684 --> 01:27:53,642
Please do your best
and show us a splendid competition.

1966
01:27:54,059 --> 01:27:55,934
Let's have a good match.

1967
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:59,183
Naniwa Bay

1968
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:00,391
Ready go!

1969
01:28:00,392 --> 01:28:02,433
All the best!!

1970
01:28:02,434 --> 01:28:05,267
Kazuha chan, show us your true strength.

1971
01:28:09,309 --> 01:28:09,851
How was it?

1972
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:12,225
Was there a karuta email?

1973
01:28:12,226 --> 01:28:14,266
Yes. About 15 minutes ago,

1974
01:28:14,267 --> 01:28:16,142
with Nagoro's forte card.

1975
01:28:16,642 --> 01:28:18,059
So it came after all huh.

1976
01:28:18,684 --> 01:28:20,766
- We have to stop the finals immediately!!
- Darn it!!

1977
01:28:20,767 --> 01:28:21,517
You hear?!

1978
01:28:21,517 --> 01:28:22,434
This way Kudo!!

1979
01:28:22,435 --> 01:28:23,725
Hey, where to?

1980
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:25,101
It'll be faster on a bike!!

1981
01:28:25,351 --> 01:28:28,100
What!? Stop the finals?

1982
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:29,559
Yes sir, understood.

1983
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:31,809
Contact the venue immediately.

1984
01:28:37,059 --> 01:28:38,267
What?

1985
01:28:39,434 --> 01:28:40,850
A tremor...

1986
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,642
There's no need to worry,
continue with the match.

1987
01:28:46,017 --> 01:28:47,891
What happened?

1988
01:28:47,892 --> 01:28:49,475
Is it broken?

1989
01:28:49,476 --> 01:28:51,641
- It was getting to the good part...
- Power Outage?

1990
01:28:51,642 --> 01:28:53,184
no, the visuals are still on

1991
01:28:53,892 --> 01:28:55,600
Not good!! It's already begun!!

1992
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:58,059
Ah. Hold on tight!!

1993
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:04,641
How are you gonna get to Satsuki Hall!

1994
01:29:04,642 --> 01:29:06,600
Trust me!! I have a plan!!

1995
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:07,601
Hey, don't tell me?!

1996
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:12,975
Even when the gods,

1997
01:29:12,976 --> 01:29:14,266
I see...

1998
01:29:14,267 --> 01:29:16,101
Happa chan didn't even move.

1999
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:19,059
Is she giving up on her forte card...

2000
01:29:24,142 --> 01:29:26,975
Why is it burning so intensely?

2001
01:29:26,976 --> 01:29:29,725
There must be some kind of propellant.

2002
01:29:29,726 --> 01:29:31,641
Hasn't the fire department arrived?

2003
01:29:31,642 --> 01:29:33,183
Due to the narrow roads within the park

2004
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,976
the fire trucks aren't able to get in...

2005
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:38,601
And the firefighting equipments
are down as well huh

2006
01:29:39,517 --> 01:29:41,351
Looks like there's really nothing
that can be done huh...

2007
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:10,266
Hattori! Do you still think that
Nagoro san is behind all of this?

2008
01:30:10,267 --> 01:30:13,350
No. There can only be one person

2009
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:16,516
who could've set up Kaieda
as a registered staff

2010
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:18,226
and handed him the bomb.

2011
01:30:18,976 --> 01:30:20,934
President Achiha Kensuke!

2012
01:30:21,309 --> 01:30:24,558
He wanted to end his own life
while bringing along the other two with him

2013
01:30:24,559 --> 01:30:27,559
I won't let such a thing happen!

2014
01:30:28,309 --> 01:30:30,808
There, hardest spot to reach...

2015
01:30:30,809 --> 01:30:32,641
Momiji san knows that as well.

2016
01:30:32,642 --> 01:30:35,101
That is where my forte card is...

2017
01:30:36,309 --> 01:30:38,059
You want to take this card right?

2018
01:30:38,684 --> 01:30:40,391
If so won't hand it over.

2019
01:30:40,392 --> 01:30:42,559
As long as I protect
this victory will be mine.

2020
01:30:43,184 --> 01:30:45,266
I'll take it. For sure I will.

2021
01:30:45,267 --> 01:30:46,892
I have to no matter what...

2022
01:30:50,559 --> 01:30:52,517
Argh it's so loud!

2023
01:30:52,851 --> 01:30:55,725
Get all these distracting noise
out of my head!

2024
01:30:55,726 --> 01:30:57,058
What's wrong Kazuha?

2025
01:30:57,059 --> 01:30:58,683
Making a scary face like that...

2026
01:30:58,684 --> 01:31:00,767
Did you have fight with someone?

2027
01:31:01,934 --> 01:31:03,266
Please excuse me.

2028
01:31:03,267 --> 01:31:03,851
Go ahead.

2029
01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:07,433
That's right,

2030
01:31:07,434 --> 01:31:09,642
I shouldn't be starting a fight... I can't!

2031
01:31:10,267 --> 01:31:11,725
The sound of the air conditioner,

2032
01:31:11,726 --> 01:31:13,516
the sound of the kimono,

2033
01:31:13,517 --> 01:31:15,141
the sound of touching the cards,

2034
01:31:15,142 --> 01:31:16,641
all these subtle noise and my heartbeat...

2035
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:24,226
everything is harmony. Come within me...

2036
01:31:27,851 --> 01:31:29,517
Thank you.

2037
01:31:29,976 --> 01:31:31,642
I will catch the real sound!

2038
01:31:33,434 --> 01:31:35,808
If I hear you pine for me,

2039
01:31:35,809 --> 01:31:37,641
I shall return to you.

2040
01:31:37,642 --> 01:31:42,684
Even though I hide it,

2041
01:31:52,767 --> 01:31:55,850
The series of crimes
which have been staged to look like revenge

2042
01:31:55,851 --> 01:31:58,433
against the Satsuki Association
by Nagoro san,

2043
01:31:58,434 --> 01:32:00,642
was all part of the scenario planned
by Achiha san.

2044
01:32:00,892 --> 01:32:02,475
Five years ago, Nagoro,

2045
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:04,850
who was going up
against Satsuki san in the competition,

2046
01:32:04,851 --> 01:32:07,892
somehow decided to show up the night
before to have a prelude match.

2047
01:32:08,559 --> 01:32:10,308
According to Achiha san,

2048
01:32:10,309 --> 01:32:12,266
the result was a victory for Satsuki,
except...

2049
01:32:12,267 --> 01:32:14,058
There is something inconsistent
on that point.

2050
01:32:14,059 --> 01:32:16,101
Because of the picture
in the article we saw at the hotel?!

2051
01:32:16,642 --> 01:32:19,183
Yeah. In Achiha san's introductory articles,

2052
01:32:19,184 --> 01:32:21,933
it said that
the car had always been spotless on the day

2053
01:32:21,934 --> 01:32:24,141
before Satsuki san's competition,

2054
01:32:24,142 --> 01:32:25,976
but that wasn't the case in that picture.

2055
01:32:26,184 --> 01:32:28,975
If the car hadn't been cleaned the day
before such an important competition,

2056
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:31,351
that would mean he knew that
Nagoro wasn't going to show up.

2057
01:32:34,726 --> 01:32:37,267
It seems like I'm much faster than you.

2058
01:32:37,642 --> 01:32:40,059
No, I'm the one that was faster.

2059
01:32:40,767 --> 01:32:45,559
Whoever was faster,
I think you'd know that best yourself.

2060
01:32:47,601 --> 01:32:51,017
I never thought that the match
would last till the tiebreaker round...

2061
01:32:54,267 --> 01:32:56,183
That prelude match five years ago...

2062
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,350
Assuming that Satsuki san had lost,

2063
01:32:58,351 --> 01:33:00,142
wouldn't that become a motive for the crime?

2064
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:03,016
Yeah. In order to protect the honor
of the Satsuki Association,

2065
01:33:03,017 --> 01:33:04,726
Nagoro had to be silenced.

2066
01:33:05,017 --> 01:33:08,350
And, looking at the karuta images
left behind in the evidence...

2067
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:11,642
Yajima san had found out
about Achiha san's crime!

2068
01:33:12,101 --> 01:33:14,850
But, what kind of evidence
would that karuta make...

2069
01:33:14,851 --> 01:33:18,934
If Nagoro san's bloodstained karuta
had been carelessly picked up...

2070
01:33:19,559 --> 01:33:21,058
I see! The fingerprints!!

2071
01:33:21,059 --> 01:33:23,809
I didn't realize it myself
until I saw a certain picture but,

2072
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:27,684
I believe that Achiha san's fingerprints
would be on that karuta.

2073
01:33:28,017 --> 01:33:30,100
That's why Yajima proposed
the idea of the special feature

2074
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:32,226
on Satsuki Association
to the television station

2075
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:36,559
He was trying to preserve the image
of Satsuki Association's karuta as evidence!

2076
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:37,851
Yeah.

2077
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:39,641
That's why the bombing
at Nichiuri Television

2078
01:33:39,642 --> 01:33:42,017
and Yajima san's murder
were carried out at the same time.

2079
01:33:42,226 --> 01:33:45,016
So that was the case... but why?!

2080
01:33:45,017 --> 01:33:49,891
What did the Achiha Association
and even the finals have to be involved?

2081
01:33:49,892 --> 01:33:52,516
If Nagoro san's body were
to be found in Satsuki Hall,

2082
01:33:52,517 --> 01:33:54,226
the venue where the finals are being held...

2083
01:33:54,476 --> 01:33:55,558
Indeed...

2084
01:33:55,559 --> 01:33:57,059
that would be
the most suitable hiding place...

2085
01:33:57,642 --> 01:34:01,101
So all this had been planned out
right from the start huh...

2086
01:34:01,309 --> 01:34:03,391
Even if the plan to frame Nagoro san

2087
01:34:03,392 --> 01:34:05,017
as the culprit had been
carried out perfectly,

2088
01:34:05,434 --> 01:34:07,391
if Nagoro's body being found later...

2089
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:10,267
it would all be... for nothing huh

2090
01:34:10,684 --> 01:34:11,934
I see it!!

2091
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:19,183
Having seen the heartless morning moon.

2092
01:34:19,184 --> 01:34:20,433
With people, well...

2093
01:34:20,434 --> 01:34:21,351
A void card...

2094
01:34:21,352 --> 01:34:23,391
That's bad! The flames have spread
all the way over there...

2095
01:34:23,392 --> 01:34:24,725
We gotta get off quick!

2096
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:25,975
But, what now...?!

2097
01:34:25,976 --> 01:34:27,184
Also, if we don't put that out...

2098
01:34:27,809 --> 01:34:29,391
There isn't time to hesitate!

2099
01:34:29,392 --> 01:34:32,308
Just think of a way to put out the fire!

2100
01:34:32,309 --> 01:34:33,516
Hey don't tell me...

2101
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:34,517
No way!?

2102
01:34:34,518 --> 01:34:36,767
Let's go! Kudo!

2103
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,017
Go!

2104
01:34:53,642 --> 01:34:54,642
What?!

2105
01:35:00,309 --> 01:35:02,142
Yeah, all the way!

2106
01:35:04,976 --> 01:35:06,601
Hurry! Please make it!

2107
01:35:07,767 --> 01:35:09,016
-What?! A fire...!?

2108
01:35:09,017 --> 01:35:10,559
Don't come over! Get inside!

2109
01:35:10,809 --> 01:35:12,726
- Heiji!
- Why are you here?

2110
01:35:16,017 --> 01:35:17,641
Oi! The rapids are changing direction!

2111
01:35:17,642 --> 01:35:18,267
It's a miracle!

2112
01:35:18,268 --> 01:35:19,350
-The flames are being extinguished!

2113
01:35:19,351 --> 01:35:21,517
W What is happening?

2114
01:35:24,476 --> 01:35:27,475
Whew, looks like we made it somehow...

2115
01:35:27,476 --> 01:35:29,559
As expected, Kudo...

2116
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:32,475
Heiji kun, what is happening?

2117
01:35:32,476 --> 01:35:34,766
It's dangerous here,
didn't I tell you to go inside?

2118
01:35:34,767 --> 01:35:36,433
Conan kun too?

2119
01:35:36,434 --> 01:35:39,058
What in the world happened?
Whats with the both of you?

2120
01:35:39,059 --> 01:35:42,226
Well, I suppose it'll be faster
if you ask Achiha san.

2121
01:35:42,601 --> 01:35:44,141
What is the meaning of this?

2122
01:35:44,142 --> 01:35:46,266
The two of you, get behind me.

2123
01:35:46,267 --> 01:35:48,975
Eh?! Why is there a need to step back?

2124
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:51,225
Hey, Achiha san. This karuta...

2125
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:53,350
It's going to look bad on you
if we investigate it, wouldn't it?

2126
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:54,558
Heiji,

2127
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:57,225
what are the two of you saying
since a moment ago?

2128
01:35:57,226 --> 01:36:01,767
The answer to the recent string of crimes
lies with that old man.

2129
01:36:01,976 --> 01:36:03,683
The origin of the crimes...

2130
01:36:03,684 --> 01:36:07,642
Started about a year ago,
when Momiji won at this very location...

2131
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:08,684
At that time,

2132
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:10,891
the stack of cards that Momiji collected

2133
01:36:10,892 --> 01:36:15,684
during the match was extremely similar
to that of Nagoro's...

2134
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:19,183
Indeed, my forte cards are
the same Nagoro sensei's

2135
01:36:19,184 --> 01:36:21,808
because I was taught
my attacking style of karuta by him... but...

2136
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,266
Unless there's really such a coincidence...
you can't possibly...

2137
01:36:24,267 --> 01:36:26,476
But such a coincidence really happened..

2138
01:36:27,142 --> 01:36:30,600
has to do with the black marks on the side
this Satsuki Association's karuta.

2139
01:36:30,601 --> 01:36:32,433
The deceased Yajima san

2140
01:36:32,434 --> 01:36:35,809
had found out the truth behind the stain that
showed up all of a sudden five years ago...

2141
01:36:36,184 --> 01:36:38,641
What in the world are those black marks?

2142
01:36:38,642 --> 01:36:40,641
The fingerprint of the person
who held this karuta card

2143
01:36:40,642 --> 01:36:43,059
with his hand stained
with Nagoro san's blood.

2144
01:36:43,392 --> 01:36:45,558
A trace of blood
belonging to Nagoro sensei...

2145
01:36:45,559 --> 01:36:48,725
Nagoro san, who has been missing
since five years ago,

2146
01:36:48,726 --> 01:36:50,475
was actually murdered at the time.

2147
01:36:50,476 --> 01:36:52,475
N No way...

2148
01:36:52,476 --> 01:36:54,392
And the owner of that fingerprint is...

2149
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,767
Nagoro san's killer.

2150
01:36:58,517 --> 01:37:01,517
I concede. I shall confess everything...

2151
01:37:01,976 --> 01:37:04,266
In exchange...
Satsuki Association's karuta...

2152
01:37:04,267 --> 01:37:06,851
Please don't turn it in as evidence...

2153
01:37:07,142 --> 01:37:08,725
To the Satsuki Association that karuta is...

2154
01:37:08,726 --> 01:37:10,351
So that's why...

2155
01:37:10,892 --> 01:37:13,475
There was something
I couldn't understand before but...

2156
01:37:13,476 --> 01:37:15,267
after seeing you like this now I get it.

2157
01:37:15,642 --> 01:37:19,100
The fingerprint on this karuta...
isn't yours, am I right?

2158
01:37:19,101 --> 01:37:22,141
No, it's mine! There's no mistake about it!

2159
01:37:22,142 --> 01:37:23,725
Indeed!

2160
01:37:23,726 --> 01:37:27,558
Kaieda and yourself were behind
the recent string of crimes but...

2161
01:37:27,559 --> 01:37:31,141
the Nagoro san's murder five years ago...

2162
01:37:31,142 --> 01:37:32,434
wasn't because of you!

2163
01:37:33,059 --> 01:37:34,642
It's Satsuki san, isn't it?

2164
01:37:44,767 --> 01:37:48,809
I understood everything
after I witnessed that scene...

2165
01:37:49,059 --> 01:37:53,226
Nagoro issued a challenge...
and Satsuki had lost...

2166
01:37:56,559 --> 01:38:00,767
They used the cassette
I kept of myself as the reader...

2167
01:38:01,184 --> 01:38:03,726
You understand what that means right?

2168
01:38:04,434 --> 01:38:07,641
Satsuki had used that tape
for practice countless of time.

2169
01:38:07,642 --> 01:38:10,683
Of course, aside from the reading patterns,

2170
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:14,851
Satsuki would have to some extent memorized
the order of the cards being read out...

2171
01:38:16,059 --> 01:38:19,225
Regardless of the overwhelming advantage
that she had,

2172
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,559
Satsuki lost...

2173
01:38:21,851 --> 01:38:26,141
Nagoro's ability was
beyond our wildest imagination...

2174
01:38:26,142 --> 01:38:29,308
I wonder how much fear Satsuki
must have felt...

2175
01:38:29,309 --> 01:38:34,101
She was sure to face a crushing defeat
in the match the following day...

2176
01:38:34,309 --> 01:38:38,601
That fear drove her to resort to crime...

2177
01:38:39,101 --> 01:38:40,600
Ever since then,

2178
01:38:40,601 --> 01:38:43,183
Satsuki began
to lose all emotion as a person...

2179
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:46,975
And grew further away
from Satsuki Association's administration.

2180
01:38:46,976 --> 01:38:50,767
Two years later she died of an illness.

2181
01:38:51,434 --> 01:38:55,142
This is the truth. Please understand.

2182
01:38:56,434 --> 01:38:57,267
Stop!

2183
01:38:57,268 --> 01:38:58,350
Achiha! Don't!

2184
01:38:58,351 --> 01:39:00,184
It's all Nagoro's fault.

2185
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:03,225
If that man didn't humiliate Satsuki...

2186
01:39:03,226 --> 01:39:04,266
Such a thing wouldn't have...

2187
01:39:04,267 --> 01:39:06,101
It's because he didn't want
to humiliate her!

2188
01:39:06,684 --> 01:39:09,809
That's why Nagoro sensei went
over a day before, right??

2189
01:39:10,559 --> 01:39:13,600
There was something that
I had asked Nagoro sensei previously

2190
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:17,267
"Why do you despise
the Satsuki Association so much?"

2191
01:39:17,976 --> 01:39:22,434
Despise...? I see,
so that's how it looks like...

2192
01:39:23,059 --> 01:39:26,267
If I didn't
then I wouldn't be able to challenge her...

2193
01:39:26,517 --> 01:39:30,851
All I want is to win and be praised by her...

2194
01:39:32,017 --> 01:39:34,517
by my first love...

2195
01:39:35,351 --> 01:39:36,767
F-first love...?

2196
01:39:37,184 --> 01:39:38,308
That's right.

2197
01:39:38,309 --> 01:39:42,434
Nagoro sensei admired Satsuki
and started karuta...

2198
01:39:43,017 --> 01:39:45,350
However, because of a condition in his eyes
he was told by his doctor that

2199
01:39:45,351 --> 01:39:48,017
he could only continue karuta
for no more than a year...

2200
01:39:48,267 --> 01:39:51,934
I think that's
why he played karuta so aggressively...

2201
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:54,976
because he didn't have much time left...

2202
01:39:55,392 --> 01:39:58,100
So... he challenged Satsuki the day before

2203
01:39:58,101 --> 01:40:01,059
in order to avoid defeating her
in front of everybody...

2204
01:40:01,642 --> 01:40:04,100
And also because he hoped
to request upon Satsuki Association

2205
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:06,391
to take in his students including myself

2206
01:40:06,392 --> 01:40:09,726
when he could no longer continue
to be our mentor...

2207
01:40:10,142 --> 01:40:12,141
Without knowing that, Satsuki san...

2208
01:40:12,142 --> 01:40:15,184
ended up killing Nagoro san...

2209
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:18,351
N No way...

2210
01:40:21,684 --> 01:40:25,434
W What have I done...

2211
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:35,392
What now!

2212
01:40:35,976 --> 01:40:36,892
Kazuha!

2213
01:40:40,684 --> 01:40:41,892
Kazuha!!

2214
01:40:42,267 --> 01:40:43,308
Are you alright?

2215
01:40:43,309 --> 01:40:44,391
Yea.

2216
01:40:44,392 --> 01:40:46,184
But I can't stand up right...

2217
01:40:51,142 --> 01:40:53,516
Everyone quick, into the elevator!

2218
01:40:53,517 --> 01:40:54,809
Momiji! Hurry! Go!

2219
01:40:55,934 --> 01:40:57,558
Quick, get up and go!

2220
01:40:57,559 --> 01:40:59,725
I'm fine, just leave me and go...

2221
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:01,183
Idiot!!

2222
01:41:01,184 --> 01:41:03,101
I can't possibly let you die now!!

2223
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:04,767
Momiji san!

2224
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,434
Hurry, get on!

2225
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:09,933
Kazuha!!

2226
01:41:09,934 --> 01:41:11,766
Climb up over here!

2227
01:41:11,767 --> 01:41:12,559
O Okay...

2228
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,059
Grab on!

2229
01:41:14,434 --> 01:41:16,517
Darn it... just a little more...

2230
01:41:17,892 --> 01:41:19,184
Gotcha!

2231
01:41:20,976 --> 01:41:21,767
W What?!

2232
01:41:27,809 --> 01:41:29,016
Please...

2233
01:41:29,017 --> 01:41:30,642
Don't fall yet!!

2234
01:41:37,309 --> 01:41:38,767
Darn it!

2235
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,267
What?!

2236
01:41:49,309 --> 01:41:51,184
As if I'll let you!

2237
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,600
Are you alright? We're going now!

2238
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:09,226
That was close...

2239
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:10,892
Hattori!

2240
01:42:15,434 --> 01:42:16,891
This is bad, it's going to collapse!

2241
01:42:16,892 --> 01:42:18,476
We have to move away!

2242
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:26,725
Eh?! Wait... How come?

2243
01:42:26,726 --> 01:42:28,892
Why is it going away?

2244
01:42:29,142 --> 01:42:30,101
Heiji

2245
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:31,059
Kazuha, get on!

2246
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,350
-This girl here is fine.

2247
01:42:33,351 --> 01:42:35,142
Someone still in there.

2248
01:42:35,726 --> 01:42:38,059
Please. Make it out somehow!

2249
01:42:44,017 --> 01:42:45,391
Heiji! Over there!

2250
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:46,351
Ok

2251
01:42:47,267 --> 01:42:48,891
What's the matter Heiji?

2252
01:42:48,892 --> 01:42:50,725
Hold on tight

2253
01:42:50,726 --> 01:42:52,016
Don't tell me,

2254
01:42:52,017 --> 01:42:54,308
you're planning to jump all the way
to the other side of the wall?

2255
01:42:54,309 --> 01:42:56,350
Good guess... Exactly...

2256
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:57,559
No... No way!

2257
01:42:57,726 --> 01:43:00,267
What are you thinking! It's too far away!

2258
01:43:01,101 --> 01:43:02,308
Say, Heiji

2259
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:04,558
Isn't it better to drop into the pond?

2260
01:43:04,559 --> 01:43:05,434
That's impossible!

2261
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:06,891
If we fall from this height

2262
01:43:06,892 --> 01:43:09,142
the water surface would be
as hard as concrete

2263
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,558
Hang on really tight!!

2264
01:43:12,559 --> 01:43:13,767
If you let go of that hand...

2265
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:16,392
I won't forgive you

2266
01:43:17,184 --> 01:43:18,226
Got it!!

2267
01:43:22,726 --> 01:43:24,309
As if I'd die

2268
01:43:26,101 --> 01:43:29,434
in such a place!!

2269
01:43:32,601 --> 01:43:33,434
That's?!

2270
01:43:33,434 --> 01:43:34,351
Hattori?!

2271
01:43:34,559 --> 01:43:35,975
There's something that I...

2272
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:38,434
have yet to say to Kazuha!!

2273
01:43:40,767 --> 01:43:41,892
That bike...

2274
01:43:45,184 --> 01:43:48,059
Reach!

2275
01:43:59,184 --> 01:44:00,601
Heiji...

2276
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,351
Kazuha!

2277
01:44:14,434 --> 01:44:16,851
Are you okay? Kazuha...

2278
01:44:17,892 --> 01:44:18,767
Y... Yea...

2279
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:22,726
...I think I've had enough of escaping acts...

2280
01:44:27,101 --> 01:44:28,684
...Those two...

2281
01:44:29,059 --> 01:44:31,350
For a moment I was worried
how it'd turn out...

2282
01:44:31,351 --> 01:44:32,767
By the way Heiji

2283
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:35,516
What was that thing that you had to tell me?

2284
01:44:35,517 --> 01:44:38,100
What do you mean?

2285
01:44:38,101 --> 01:44:41,933
Didn't you say that you couldn't die
before you told me something?

2286
01:44:41,934 --> 01:44:43,391
You must have misheard.

2287
01:44:43,392 --> 01:44:44,142
Definitely not!

2288
01:44:44,143 --> 01:44:47,391
I've honed my hearing
through karuta training.

2289
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:49,808
Hey if you have a problem with me tell me!

2290
01:44:49,809 --> 01:44:51,183
Hey wait up!

2291
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:52,308
What?!

2292
01:44:52,309 --> 01:44:56,267
Hey wait up!

2293
01:48:41,142 --> 01:48:43,516
Thanks for visiting me!

2294
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:45,684
I'm the one who should be thanking you...

2295
01:48:46,267 --> 01:48:48,392
By the way,
what happened to the karuta club?

2296
01:48:48,809 --> 01:48:51,391
The school recognised the efforts
of the club put in

2297
01:48:51,392 --> 01:48:55,184
when we got into the finals,
so they decided not to shut down the club

2298
01:48:55,476 --> 01:48:58,351
Even though
I ended up losing at the last moment...

2299
01:49:01,226 --> 01:49:02,433
Kazuha chan... Eh?

2300
01:49:02,434 --> 01:49:03,766
Ran chan! Come here for a sec...

2301
01:49:03,767 --> 01:49:05,683
I wonder what's up with them?

2302
01:49:05,684 --> 01:49:08,601
Hey what... a secret talk huh...

2303
01:49:09,017 --> 01:49:09,976
Really?

2304
01:49:09,977 --> 01:49:11,641
Yeah really. It's all good,

2305
01:49:11,642 --> 01:49:13,433
because I was able
to win the "shinoburedo" card

2306
01:49:13,434 --> 01:49:16,184
I see! So you ended up
targeting that card after all!

2307
01:49:16,434 --> 01:49:18,725
No no, it's not just the poem.

2308
01:49:18,726 --> 01:49:21,391
Look, the name of the person
who recited that poem!

2309
01:49:21,392 --> 01:49:24,391
Taira no Kanemori!
The only person in the Hyakunin Isshu

2310
01:49:24,392 --> 01:49:27,642
whose name is written
with the same initial kanji as Heiji's!

2311
01:49:27,934 --> 01:49:31,059
I can't see it any other way
except as Heiji's card now...

2312
01:49:31,934 --> 01:49:35,142
I'll send an image of that card
to Heiji later~

2313
01:49:35,392 --> 01:49:37,684
This is my feelings towards him.

2314
01:49:38,309 --> 01:49:39,975
Sending "shinoburedo"

2315
01:49:39,976 --> 01:49:41,476
to confess one's feelings?

2316
01:49:42,059 --> 01:49:43,851
That's against the rule!

2317
01:49:44,226 --> 01:49:45,391
Momiji san!?

2318
01:49:45,392 --> 01:49:47,142
Did you hear that?

2319
01:49:47,809 --> 01:49:50,350
I have good ears, unlike you...

2320
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:51,517
Well if it isn't Momiji!

2321
01:49:52,226 --> 01:49:53,975
What are you doing in a place like this?

2322
01:49:53,976 --> 01:49:56,684
As promised, I came to confess my feelings...

2323
01:49:57,226 --> 01:49:58,516
In the first place,

2324
01:49:58,517 --> 01:50:01,016
I was the one
who was confessed to by Heiji kun...

2325
01:50:01,017 --> 01:50:03,183
Huh? What does that mean?

2326
01:50:03,184 --> 01:50:05,975
This is... the photo as proof!

2327
01:50:05,976 --> 01:50:07,308
They joined little fingers...

2328
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:09,600
He definitely made a promise there...

2329
01:50:09,601 --> 01:50:12,641
If you break it
you have to swallow a thousand needles...

2330
01:50:12,642 --> 01:50:15,891
H Hey wait!
What kinda promise was that anyway?

2331
01:50:15,892 --> 01:50:16,933
The next time we meet,
(Kondo autara, )

2332
01:50:16,934 --> 01:50:18,559
I'll take you as my wife so just you wait!
(yome ni toru sakai, mattokeya!)

2333
01:50:20,184 --> 01:50:23,476
This guy... getting his
embarrassing moment caught again...

2334
01:50:24,059 --> 01:50:25,391
Or perhaps...

2335
01:50:25,392 --> 01:50:28,142
are you trying to take it
as an old story which never happened?

2336
01:50:29,267 --> 01:50:31,100
Ahh! I remember now!

2337
01:50:31,101 --> 01:50:33,016
This was what I said at that time!

2338
01:50:33,017 --> 01:50:36,183
Don't cry...
We can have another match next time!

2339
01:50:36,184 --> 01:50:37,558
But the next time we meet...
(...kondo autara)

2340
01:50:37,559 --> 01:50:41,350
I'll brush up my skill and wait!
(moto TSUYOME NI TORU SAKAI, ude migaite MATTOKEYA)

2341
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:42,226
Meaning...

2342
01:50:42,227 --> 01:50:43,725
"YOME NI"
(I take you..)

2343
01:50:43,726 --> 01:50:44,934
"TORU SAKAI"
(...as my wife?)

2344
01:50:45,559 --> 01:50:47,100
Hey my opponent was a lady

2345
01:50:47,101 --> 01:50:48,516
so I had to take care not to hurt her,

2346
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:50,726
that's why I played really nice

2347
01:50:51,101 --> 01:50:53,558
Iori... we're going!

2348
01:50:53,559 --> 01:50:54,851
Yes my lady.

2349
01:50:55,226 --> 01:50:58,683
Look, I'll leave it at that
and give it a break for today but...

2350
01:50:58,684 --> 01:51:01,726
I'll never let anyone take away
a single card that I target...

2351
01:51:02,434 --> 01:51:04,517
I'll have you remember that...

2352
01:51:05,726 --> 01:51:07,017
Kazuha chan...

2353
01:51:09,934 --> 01:51:10,975
What...

2354
01:51:10,976 --> 01:51:13,101
She just wants to play karuta
with Kazuha again, doesn't she?

2355
01:51:20,059 --> 01:51:21,184
I'm sorry, were you asleep?

2356
01:51:21,767 --> 01:51:24,558
Sonoko, you're pretty familiar
with Hyakunin Isshu right?

2357
01:51:24,559 --> 01:51:26,892
Yea. I play karuta with my family on
during the new year.

2358
01:51:27,434 --> 01:51:31,016
I sent Shinichi an image
of the "meguriaite" card and,

2359
01:51:31,017 --> 01:51:33,726
I got the "sewohayami" poem as reply...

2360
01:51:33,934 --> 01:51:37,016
what was the meaning again?
It slipped my mind...

2361
01:51:37,017 --> 01:51:40,225
"Even though now
I am separated from my beloved,

2362
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:42,683
someday surely let's meet again"

2363
01:51:42,684 --> 01:51:45,141
It's an extremely romantic poem
recited by Emperor Sutoku.

2364
01:51:45,142 --> 01:51:46,350
There you go~

2365
01:51:46,351 --> 01:51:47,892
Ah!! Hey Sonoko~!!

2366
01:51:48,934 --> 01:51:51,309
Hey come on, don't you forget that.
