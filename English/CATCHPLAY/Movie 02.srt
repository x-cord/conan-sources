1
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,250
Mom?!

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,709
Stay away, Ran!

3
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,542
Just a dream...

4
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:11,894
Eh? You dreamed I was shot?

5
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,894
Is that why you called me
so early in the morning?

6
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:17,727
Oh, come on, I was worried!

7
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:22,727
Sometimes even lawyers get people
who have grudges against them...

8
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:26,560
You're just being paranoid, Ran.

9
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,560
It's because of all
those crimes you've seen

10
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:32,268
that you have dreams like that.

11
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,975
But I'm glad you're all right!

12
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:40,501
Oh, yeah! You were a little younger
in my dream, you know!

13
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,501
My! How rude! I'll have
you know I'm still young!

14
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:53,975
Oh, I'm sorry! Please forgive my rudeness!

15
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,834
Very well, then!

16
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,501
Okay, so 7:00 tonight, right?
Dad and Conan-kun can't wait, either!

17
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,918
I wonder... Does she remember?

18
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,393
Conan-kun...

19
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,975
What's goin' on? Why're you up so early?

20
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:36,393
Oh, no reason. Sorry for waking you up.

21
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:40,975
Oh, it's tonight! Our dinner date
with Ran's mom...

22
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,999
Man, I can't stand that lady...

23
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:02,810
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi.

24
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:06,894
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

25
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:10,417
where I witnessed a suspicious deal
with a man dressed in black!

26
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,975
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

27
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,999
that I didn't notice a second man
sneak up from behind me!

28
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,894
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

29
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,975
...my body had shrunk!

30
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,975
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

31
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,975
putting all the people around me in danger!

32
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:36,560
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

33
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:40,976
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,975
To get information on the men,

35
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,560
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

36
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:50,727
Yes. This guy is Ran's father...

37
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:55,975
...and the now-incredibly
famous detective, Mori Kogoro.

38
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,975
But he's really a bonehead detective...

39
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:02,375
...and you all know who's really
solving the crimes, right?

40
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:08,000
The secret behind that is in
the two gadgets Dr. Agasa made for me!

41
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,685
The first... is this!

42
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,626
The Stun-Gun Wrist-Watch!

43
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:19,643
Pressing the button while using
the aiming device on the cover

44
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:24,975
will launch a tranquilizer needle
that can knock a person out instantly!

45
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,292
Next is the Voice-Changing Bow-Tie!

46
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,975
By adjusting the dials on the back,

47
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:35,209
I can produce all types of voices,
from children to adult!

48
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,918
For offensive items, I have
the Power Assisted Kick Shoes!

49
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,975
They use electricity and magnetic fields
to stimulate my feet muscles

50
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,975
and maximize my kick power!

51
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,834
To chase down criminals, I have
the Turbo-Engine Skateboard!

52
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:59,393
And an unexpectedly sweet item
are these Elasticity Suspenders!

53
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:02,501
One press of a button, and the rubber
will expand or contract!

54
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,918
It's a really unique gadget!

55
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:23,268
I can't ID the men in black yet,
but other cases won't wait for me!

56
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,643
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

57
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,292
There is always only one truth!

58
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,667
"Mori Kogoro-Beika Street, Beika City"

59
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,143
Genta-kun! You're gonna eat that one, too?!

60
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,059
Who cares how many I eat?!

61
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,976
This one's a Black Choco Bar!
It's got a grownup taste!

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,976
Oh?! Really?!

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,685
Yeah, right.

64
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,999
Geez, what's taking him so long?

65
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:33,975
Look! Look!

66
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:34,268
"You two are a perfect match!"
Look! Look!

67
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,975
"You two are a perfect match!"
Conan-kun and I are a perfect match!

68
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:37,727
Conan-kun and I are a perfect match!

69
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,477
A-are you sure that game's not broken?!

70
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,185
B-but more importantly, Genta-kun!

71
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:47,250
Card fortune-telling is
obviously a pack of lies!

72
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,685
Now let's check Conan-kun's!
His birthday is...

73
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,975
Hey, now.

74
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,125
Don't be tellin' people's fortunes
without their permission.

75
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,626
"You and the girl of your heart
are rapidly approaching!"

76
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,959
It must be talking
about me and Conan-kun!

77
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,250
"An 'A' is in your future"

78
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,975
- An "A" is in your future?
- An "A" is in your future?

79
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,059
"A"?!

80
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,976
Oh, geez. How old of a game is that thing?

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,685
Hey. What does "A" mean?

82
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,477
The letter A, you see,
is the one before the letter B...

83
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,477
So it means fried shrimp!
("AB" sounds like "ebi" which is shrimp)

84
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,042
Oh. So it doesn't mean "kiss".
(It actually does mean "kiss")

85
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,602
Sorry! Sorry! I overslept! ...Huh?

86
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:40,810
...Geez! What took you so long, Doc?!

87
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,584
Sorry...

88
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,727
Awesome!

89
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,959
Look at all the planes!

90
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,976
I hear you can even play a
helicopter flight simulator here!

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,018
- That sounds like fun!
- Yeah!

92
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,975
Too bad!

93
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,393
Why's that, Conan?

94
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:13,143
It says here only fifth graders
and up can do the flight simulator!

95
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,435
Aww, that's no fun.

96
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:19,999
Sorry. I played it to death
when I got into 5th grade.

97
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,560
In that case, how about I tell
you all an interesting story?

98
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:30,018
Hey. We're in for a long story
if we don't stop him now.

99
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,643
Leave it to me.

100
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,975
The "Pegasus" from Greek mythology is-

101
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,768
Tadah! And now for a quiz!

102
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,477
Huh? What're you doing?

103
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,975
Three people who were born
on New Year's Day, April Fool's Day,

104
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,310
and Children's Day all
got together and formed a club!

105
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,143
So, what was their club's name?

106
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,685
Here's a hint: it's a flying animal,
much like the Pegasus!

107
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,999
A flying animal?

108
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,975
Oh? You figured it out, Conan-kun?

109
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,602
Of course! You just need to
add their birthdays, right?

110
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,268
- Eh?
- Birthdays?

111
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:10,852
January 1st, April 1st,
May 5th... October 7th?

112
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:13,975
Yep! October 7th!

113
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:18,685
It's the Tonakai (Reindeer)!
(to = 10, na =7, kai = club)

114
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,685
And they fly while pulling
a sled on Christmas, right?

115
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,375
Correct! You're so smart, Conan-kun!

116
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,501
Hey! Isn't that Shishido Eimei?!

117
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,059
- So cool!
- So cool!

118
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,876
"Mori Detective Agency"

119
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,935
- Thank you!
- Next, please!

120
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,209
"To Mori Ran"

121
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,810
Alright! Here you go!

122
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:06,185
Thank you so much! I'm a
big fan of yours, Nishina-san!

123
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,626
Please continue to write
lots of delicious books!

124
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,768
That's a unique comment. Thank you.

125
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:18,101
He's even hotter than he is in pictures!

126
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,852
His type is my favorite!

127
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,375
You're so silly, Sonoko...

128
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,999
- What a reckless driver!
- Isn't that...

129
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,685
It is Osanai Nana, the model!

130
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,018
I have no interest in women.

131
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,626
Let's get some tea!

132
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,059
What time do you have
dinner with your mom?

133
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,226
7:00.

134
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,894
Did you set it up again this time too?

135
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:58,768
Yeah.

136
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,976
You sure have it rough, too.

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,685
What was it, ten years ago
when your mom left?

138
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,518
Yeah. When I was seven...

139
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,975
...I remember them having a big argument.

140
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,393
Apparently they split
because of personality conflicts.

141
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,709
And then in no time flat...

142
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,334
...your mom began to flourish
as a lawyer, right?

143
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,975
In contrast, your dad quit his job
as a police detective,

144
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,143
and became a lousy private eye instead.

145
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,999
Wha?

146
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:39,435
Yeah! Your dad's suddenly
all famous and stuff now,

147
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,542
but I bet he would've ruined himself
by now had you not been there.

148
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:52,975
I don't think so, but my mom
was really with-it in that regard.

149
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,894
I'm back!

150
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:56,268
Welcome back!

151
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,393
Huh? He's still not ready?

152
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:04,143
He went to play mahjong
during lunch and just got back now!

153
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:08,975
Geez! Why do I hafta eat dinner with Eri?!

154
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:13,643
Please quit complaining
and get ready already.

155
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,975
I'm here at the house
of Asahi Katsuyoshi-san,

156
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,727
owner of Aqua Crystal,

157
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:25,042
the aquatic recreation center opening
today by the Toto Bay!

158
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,975
Conan-kun.

159
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,751
I'll change too!

160
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,560
Sorry, Mom! We ran a little late!

161
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:47,292
That's all right. I'm sure "someone"
was busy playing mahjong.

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,560
She's as sharp as ever.

163
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,976
I gotta watch what I say around this lady...

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,268
Hello, Conan-kun!

165
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:58,709
H-hello!

166
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,976
You're so scatterbrained, Tsuji-san!

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,975
Oh! Long time, no see, Mori-san!

168
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,935
Oh! Tsuji-san!

169
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,268
Who's Mori?

170
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,435
You know, the detective.

171
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,560
- The famous detective?!
- Mori Kogoro?!

172
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,393
Yes. I am detective Mori Kogoro.

173
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,975
Oh, Tsuji-san! Let me introduce my family!

174
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,768
This is my wife Eri,
and my daughter Ran.

175
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,727
And that's Conan, the mooch.

176
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:29,185
Isn't there any other way to say that?!

177
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,975
I'm Tsuji. I played with Mori-san
in a pro-amateur golf tournament.

178
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,393
That reminds me, Tsuji-san.

179
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:38,059
Doesn't the All-American Open
begin next Thursday?

180
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:43,059
Yes! I basically practiced an
entire year for this one tournament!

181
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,727
This year, I will make it
to the top ten for sure!

182
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,975
I look forward to it!

183
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,393
But sometimes it's important
to take a breather,

184
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:55,000
so I thought I might take the girls
out for a flight tomorrow.

185
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,518
Tsuji-san here also owns and
pilots his own helicopter, you see.

186
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,602
Say! I'm planning to fly
the following Thursday, too!

187
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,975
Why don't you come along?

188
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,975
Wow! Really?!

189
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,975
Sounds wonderful!

190
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,059
Yay!

191
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:16,560
No, uhh, flying isn't really my thing,
so maybe some other time.

192
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:20,852
Oh? That's too bad.

193
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,501
He's no fun.

194
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,393
That man's name is Sawaki-san,

195
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,083
and he's known my mom and dad
since they were young.

196
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,810
What's that grape badge for?

197
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,975
That's the symbol of a sommelier.

198
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:49,918
Oh, a sommelier is someone like
Sawaki-san who specializes in wine.

199
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,268
What's that around his neck?

200
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,975
That's a "tastevin".
It's for taste-testing wine!

201
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,393
Whoa, you really know your stuff.

202
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,685
I read about it in Nishida-san's books!

203
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,393
For example, red wine is
best at room temperature,

204
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,976
and white wine and rosé are best chilled!

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,810
It's true that many people say that,

206
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:14,459
but a wine's best temperature is
really up to personal preference.

207
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,976
Excellent.

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,975
Light red wine is actually
quite delicious when chilled.

209
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:33,685
The key is that a wine's astringency
is diminished when cooled.

210
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:34,894
Really?

211
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,101
Still, I can't believe you're old enough

212
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,143
to be interested in that sort of thing now.

213
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:44,975
That just means that
we've gotten that much older.

214
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,292
That's for sure.

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
They seem to be getting along well now!

216
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,501
Oh, Conan-kun! Your mouth's all messy!

217
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,018
N-no, that's okay...

218
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,334
Come on, now! Don't move!

219
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,310
"An 'A' is in your future"

220
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,975
"An 'A' is in your future"
An "A" is in your future?

221
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:18,751
An "A" is in your future?

222
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,975
Sheesh! Kids are such a pain!

223
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,292
Urgh!

224
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,975
That was delicious.

225
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,268
The wine and food here tastes
just like it did back then!

226
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:39,351
Say. Do you remember?

227
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,018
When we first came to
this restaurant 15 years ago,

228
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:45,268
you gave me a present.

229
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:49,477
Yeah. Your favorite Zigoba chocolates.

230
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:53,185
And then we ate them all on a bench
at Beika Park on our way home.

231
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:55,250
Oh, that's right.

232
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,125
Towako-san!

233
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,810
Who's he?!

234
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,393
Isn't that Peter Ford?

235
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,685
You know. He often
hosts TV shows and stuff.

236
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,351
Dammit! What's she doing with him?!

237
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,685
Who's Towako-san?

238
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,975
She runs a hostess club in Ginza.

239
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,999
She's been extra generous whenever I've-

240
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,685
I should be going now.

241
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,810
Already? I thought we might
have some coffee back-

242
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,268
I'm sorry. I still have work to finish.

243
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,810
Thank you for the meal.

244
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,810
Mom!

245
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,167
Mom!

246
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,959
Dad!

247
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,975
Towako-san disappeared somewhere!

248
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,999
The old guy never learns...

249
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,975
Come on in.

250
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,518
"Megure Juzo"

251
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,477
"Megure Juzo"
"Megure Jusan"?

252
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:19,975
"Megure Jusan"?

253
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,351
It's read "Juzo".

254
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,143
Oh!

255
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,975
Oh, Genta-kun!

256
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,435
So Inspector Megure's name is Juzo, huh?

257
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:34,375
Oh, Mori-kun! You came all this way?
And everyone else, too?

258
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,268
We were all just about to go hiking.

259
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,560
Inspector. How is your injury?

260
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:46,518
Luckily, it missed a vital spot,
so there's no danger to his life,

261
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,185
but they say he'll need to
stay here for a few days.

262
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,560
Hey, Inspector.

263
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:54,393
Why do you always have a hat on?

264
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,976
Oh, uh, does it really matter?

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,059
- I bet he's barely got hair!
- He could have huge bumps!

266
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,976
We believe a handgun-type
crossbow was used.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,976
We're investigating this
from two directions:

268
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,226
whether he was attacked specifically,
or just for fun as he passed by.

269
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,976
Hey, old inspector guy!
Didn't you have a gun?!

270
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,477
And you still let him get away?

271
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,643
Of course he wouldn't have
a gun on him while jogging!

272
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:30,768
Plus, even if I had had one, I'm a
horrible shot, unlike Mori-kun here.

273
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,975
Eh?! My dad is good with guns?!

274
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,185
Enough to have been one of
the best shots on the entire force!

275
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,518
I guess everyone's good at something...

276
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:47,685
However, something odd was found
where the crossbow was fired.

277
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,101
Here it is.

278
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,310
- What is it?
- It looks like a Western sword.

279
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:55,975
Huh?! I've seen this somewhere before!

280
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,417
But where?

281
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,975
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

282
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,167
That's a pretty broach.

283
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:31,268
Here is your schedule for today, Sensei.

284
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,351
And I found this in the mailbox downstairs.

285
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,975
Oh, Zigoba!

286
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,518
Those are your favorite
Swiss chocolates, aren't they?

287
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,268
Ah! So he...

288
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:47,393
But I don't see the sender's name...

289
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,375
It's all right. I know
who's responsible for it.

290
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,083
Wow!

291
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:05,125
Water! Water...

292
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,584
Sensei!

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,143
How's my mother?!

294
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,685
Rest easy!

295
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:24,101
We flushed her stomach immediately,
so there's no danger to her life!

296
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,393
Thank goodness...

297
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,976
Was it poison, then?

298
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,834
Yes. We believe it was
agrochemical in type.

299
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,975
Mom!

300
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,018
Mom...

301
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,268
Ran...

302
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,852
Eri...

303
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,560
You're here too, dear?

304
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,852
Are you okay, lady?

305
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,185
Even you, Conan-kun?

306
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,768
Thank you. I'm okay now.

307
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:54,685
Just to be safe, she should
probably stay here for today.

308
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,709
Sounds good to me.

309
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:03,435
Still, first the inspector, and now Eri...
Is this just coincidence?

310
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,975
Incidentally, I hear she collapsed
the moment she ate some chocolate?

311
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:10,685
Yes. It was apparently
in the agency's mailbox.

312
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,101
Zigoba!

313
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,268
A-and... this paper flower!

314
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,393
You don't mean...
the same person did this?!

315
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,852
Huh? That flower...

316
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:23,727
Where?! Where have I seen it?!

317
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:28,768
But why would someone so cautious
eat poisoned chocolate?

318
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah. The old man got Ran's mom
mad at dinner the other night.

319
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,518
Apparently she mistook it as his apology.

320
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,059
Ah.

321
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,584
Here you are! Repairs complete!

322
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,209
Who pulled this prank?!

323
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:52,125
Doc! Don't open it!

324
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,250
Doc!

325
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:04,975
I'm fine! Go after him, Shinichi!

326
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:05,999
But!

327
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,268
Go, Shinichi! Go after him!

328
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,375
Got it!

329
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,935
Which way did he go?!

330
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:33,435
Ayumi and Genta live
down this left street...

331
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:34,792
Alright!

332
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,975
Oh, Conan-kun!

333
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,059
A black off-road motorcycle?

334
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,417
What's a black pot-holed motorcycle?

335
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:53,560
That's it! That's the
off-road motorcycle, Genta-kun!

336
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:54,810
C- Conan!

337
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:55,852
Roger that!

338
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,250
So he did turn left!

339
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:04,935
Conan-kun! He just turned right,
toward Beika Station!

340
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:05,852
Roger that!

341
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,584
Alright! I gotta beat him there!

342
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,209
Yes! Found ya!

343
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,334
Oh, no, you don't! I'm not
letting you get away!

344
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,810
Are you okay, lady?!

345
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,667
Thank you!

346
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,351
What's this?

347
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:57,250
That's it! I figured it out!

348
00:24:58,292 --> 00:24:59,727
Playing cards?

349
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:00,393
Yeah.

350
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,477
The culprit is doing these crimes
to match the pictures on the cards.

351
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:08,768
Inspector Megure was attacked first,
and his name is Juzo, right?

352
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,976
It's written as "thirteen",
thus the King of Spades!

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,125
Doesn't this king's sword look
like the one found at the scene?

354
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,143
Next, Ran's mother's name, Kisaki,
means "Queen" in English.

355
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,560
Hence the Queen of Spades.

356
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:31,709
This queen's flower is the same one
that was on the chocolate box!

357
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,101
He's right! They're the same!

358
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:38,268
But how are Dr. Agasa
and "eleven" related?

359
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:40,810
The doc's name is Agasa Hiroshi,

360
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,894
and the "shi" in his name
is a combination of 10 and 1!

361
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,059
Hence the Jack of Spades.

362
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:50,459
"Jack" originally refers to soldiers,
thus this sword-like object...

363
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,975
They're the same! No doubt about it!

364
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:59,268
But why playing cards? And why spades?

365
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,976
Spades refer to death.

366
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,685
Similarly, hearts refer to love,

367
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:08,602
diamonds refer to money,
and clubs refer to happiness.

368
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:12,976
Then is the culprit planning to
follow the playing cards in order

369
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,143
and kill people with the
numbers 13 to 1 in their names?

370
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:20,209
More specifically, people connected to you.

371
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,852
But who would do this?

372
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,685
Our only clue was the
motorcycle's license plate number,

373
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,209
but it turned out to be stolen.

374
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,685
Inspector!

375
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,310
What are you doing here?

376
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:40,727
I heard that first Eri-san was attacked,
then Dr. Agasa too...

377
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:43,059
But what about your wound?

378
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,602
It's been sewed up! I'm fine!

379
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:50,643
I heard everything. The culprit
is most likely Murakami Joe.

380
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,894
Murakami Joe?!

381
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,560
Who is he?

382
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:58,268
A maverick gambling dealer.

383
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,976
He committed a murder ten years ago,

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,975
and was just released
one week ago on parole.

385
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,976
A gambling dealer?

386
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,894
A person who deals out cards
to gambling patrons.

387
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,584
This is Murakami Joe, 10 years ago.

388
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,560
Murakami, huh...

389
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:21,560
It's true that I wouldn't be surprised
if he held a grudge against me.

390
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,894
Why's that?

391
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:24,975
Because I arrested him.

392
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:29,268
Hold on! It's only natural
that policemen arrest criminals!

393
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:31,185
That's true, but...

394
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:34,477
Actually, I have heard
about that incident.

395
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,560
If I'm not mistaken, after he was
taken to the police station...

396
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:41,975
Shiratori-kun! We don't
need to hear the story!

397
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:46,435
But why wouldn't Murakami Joe
come straight after me?

398
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,975
He could deal with me directly...

399
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:54,501
Probably to make you suffer.
So as to ruin you slowly but surely.

400
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:01,975
Say, is there anyone you know
with a "ten" in their name?!

401
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:05,393
They might be the next person
to be attacked!

402
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,310
Ten... “Juu”... “To”...

403
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,999
Towako-san!

404
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,975
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

405
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,310
Oh! Mori-sensei!

406
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:34,810
Towako-san!

407
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,975
You're all right!

408
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,292
"All right?" Did something happen?

409
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,284
Umm, Shiratori-san. What were you
going to say back at the hospital?

410
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:51,201
You know, about that Murakami guy!

411
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:55,576
Oh. Well, I guess I'll tell you
since you could find out easily enough.

412
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,160
I heard this from a superior officer.

413
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:02,241
Ten years ago, when Mori-san
was a police detective,

414
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:04,118
he and Inspector Megure-

415
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,241
Or was he still an
assistant inspector back then?

416
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:11,725
In any case, the two of them
arrested Murakami Joe for murder.

417
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:19,409
While they were interrogating him
at the police station,

418
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,659
Murakami said he wanted
to use the restroom.

419
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:28,242
Mori-san and the inspector
ordered an officer to take him there,

420
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,241
then took a smoke break
in front of the interrogation room.

421
00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:36,433
Just then, you and your mother
arrived to bring a change of clothes.

422
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,683
That's when it happened.

423
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:47,951
Murakami managed to steal
the officer's gun in the restroom.

424
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:50,160
I remember.

425
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:52,265
Just then, I...

426
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,241
Get a car ready!

427
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:08,391
This woman and I have a
rendezvous at the ends of Hell!

428
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:10,993
Mom!

429
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,058
Ran! Stay away!

430
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,242
Mori-kun.

431
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,367
What's on your mind?

432
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:41,266
Oh, nothing!

433
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:49,534
You're saying he shot her?!

434
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,743
I had forgotten until just now!

435
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,701
It must've been something
you didn't want to remember.

436
00:30:56,725 --> 00:31:00,534
But... But why would Dad shoot her?!

437
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,826
He must've been really
confident about his skill.

438
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,367
Confident he could miss the hostage
and hit only the criminal...

439
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,725
But the bullet missed
and hit your mother instead.

440
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:16,951
Apparently, the fact he shot
without concern for the hostage

441
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,325
caused quite some trouble for him
at the police station, too...

442
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:24,641
I believe it was soon afterward
that your father left the force.

443
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:39,659
Hello?

444
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:41,451
Hey, Ran! Been a while!

445
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:43,118
Shinichi?!

446
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:45,325
Dr. Agasa filled me in on everything.

447
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,160
Sounds like some bad stuff is going down.

448
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:52,993
It's much more than "bad"!
Where are you?! Come back right away!

449
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:58,743
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a case here.
I won't be back for a while.

450
00:31:58,767 --> 00:31:59,868
Oh...

451
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:02,325
Don't get all glum on me!

452
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:05,993
But the doc and the inspector
gave me a summary of what's up,

453
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,576
so if I figure anything out,
I'll call right away!

454
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,034
Tell me. Would you shoot, Shinichi?

455
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:18,265
I found out why my mom really left my dad.

456
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:24,241
The Kogoro-san shot your mom, huh...

457
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:30,241
I don't care how confident he was...
I can't believe what he did.

458
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:33,784
You would never do anything
like that, right, Shinichi?!

459
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:37,743
Good question... I dunno.

460
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:41,451
But even if it's a fact
that your dad shot your mom,

461
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:45,409
are you sure that equals
the truth behind it?

462
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:48,241
What do you mean?!
That doesn't make sense!

463
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:51,118
Anyways, that's all I can say.

464
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:52,576
Cheer up, Ran!

465
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,034
Later!

466
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:55,325
Strongly...
Wait!

467
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,409
Strongly...
Shinichi?! Shinichi?!

468
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:01,325
Strongly...

469
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:06,784
Gently...

470
00:33:06,808 --> 00:33:08,767
Gently...
The truth...

471
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:25,951
Inspector! I'll watch the emergency exit!

472
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:28,184
Wait! Mori-kun!

473
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:34,725
He gets really fired up when
there's a pretty woman involved...

474
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:52,808
The old guy never came home...

475
00:33:55,265 --> 00:34:02,725
Still, why would Murakami Joe leave
clues that point straight to him?

476
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:07,701
Is he trying to challenge
the old guy and the police?

477
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:13,576
But how did Murakami research
his acquaintances from behind bars?

478
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,433
He even knew Ran's mother's
favorite brand of chocolate...

479
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,683
"Tsuji Hiroki"

480
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,241
Tsuji Hiroki...

481
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:27,451
Tsuji...

482
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:28,784
"Ten"
Tsuji...

483
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:29,641
"Ten"

484
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,826
Tsuji Hiroki? The pro golfer?

485
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,617
Yes! Conan-kun noticed it,
but Tsuji's name has a "ten" in it!

486
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,076
Tsuji...

487
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,241
She's right! There is one!

488
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:46,241
I called his home, but he left
for the heliport 30 minutes ago!

489
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:47,242
Got it!

490
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:51,451
Contact the station and have them
send someone to keep watch here.

491
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes, sir!

492
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:59,308
Conan-kun! Let's go, too!

493
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:06,241
Let's go, Mori-kun!

494
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:08,808
Go? To get breakfast?

495
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,600
Dad!

496
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:28,576
Hey, you! What're you doing here?!

497
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,701
Don't give us that!
We're involved in this too, you know!

498
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:34,892
I'm your daughter!

499
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:41,241
So, people connected to Mori-san
are being attacked one by one?

500
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:44,241
Yes. Counting down from 13.

501
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:47,826
And since you're #10,
you're in danger now!

502
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,826
Anyways, it'd be wise to
cancel your flight for today.

503
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,241
I'll be fine!

504
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:57,076
If you're that worried, why don't
you and Mori-san come with me?

505
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,241
No, flying isn't really-

506
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,826
Incidentally, where is
your flight to today?

507
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,617
Toto Airport. With other places
along the way, though.

508
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:08,241
When did you submit your flight plan?

509
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:12,201
Hmm... The day before yesterday,
at the Aviation Bureau.

510
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,118
Inspector.

511
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:17,076
There's a chance Murakami
is lying in wait at Toto Airport.

512
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,409
Alright! You head for
Toto Airport in the car!

513
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:21,784
Yes, sir!

514
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:26,617
Mori-kun! Just to be safe,
we're going to ride the helicopter, too!

515
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:30,118
Ran-kun! I know how you feel,
but this is as far as you go.

516
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:32,241
But!

517
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:34,367
Fine.

518
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:38,076
Inspector! I'd prefer to go
with Detective Shiratori in the car!

519
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,951
Are you trying to run away on your own?!

520
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,933
I, uhh, need to use the restroom!

521
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:53,076
I- Inspector! I don't want to die too!

522
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,325
Get in! If you die, we'll die together!

523
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,349
So we are gonna die!

524
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,641
Well, I'm off.

525
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:19,241
Conan-kun. We should get going-

526
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,265
Huh? Where are you?!

527
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:23,933
He couldn't be!

528
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,617
One sheep! Two sheep!

529
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:32,909
Is that an anti-crashing spell?

530
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,492
- Conan-kun!
- When did you get in here?!

531
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:40,367
I always wanted to try sitting
next to a pilot's seat!

532
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,743
Welcome to my cockpit!

533
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,826
We're scheduled to fly over your place
on Beika Street, you know!

534
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,784
Yay! That's great!

535
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,868
We have no choice.
We can't exactly go back now.

536
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:53,808
But if you cause any trouble,
I'm tossin' you out!

537
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:12,325
Nothing seems out of the ordinary...

538
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,659
Whatcha lookin' at?

539
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:17,225
You're in a helicopter here!
Take a look outside!

540
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,367
Is something the matter?

541
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,993
Not at all.

542
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:27,241
Say, you applied some eyedrops earlier.
Do you always use them?

543
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:33,241
Yeah, when I'm driving, or when
I'm piloting my helicopter.

544
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:35,241
Beika Street's coming up now!

545
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:36,683
So it is!

546
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:42,160
Mori-kun! There's your place, too!

547
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,850
I don't wanna look!

548
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:55,868
What's wrong?!

549
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,617
It's too bright! I can't open my eyes!

550
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:58,993
Say what?!

551
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:01,034
Wait! Were those eyedrops-!

552
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:02,808
- Does that mean...
- Does that mean...

553
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:08,184
Mister! We're drifting to the left!

554
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,534
M- Mori-kun! Do you know how to fly?!

555
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:16,325
Of course I don't!

556
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,659
We can't stay in the air like this!

557
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:22,160
I gotta find a place we can land!

558
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:24,409
Teitan Elementary! Alright!

559
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:25,617
Huh?!

560
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:27,241
I'm gonna land us in the schoolyard!

561
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,534
You handle the pedals
and corrective measures!

562
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:33,284
Wha?! You idiot! No! Stop!
Are you trying to kill us?!

563
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:37,409
Don't worry! I did lots of flight simulator
practice when I was a kid!

564
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:39,951
B-but you still are a kid...

565
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:42,534
Tsuji-san! We're gonna crash
if we don't do something now!

566
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:43,933
Help me out!

567
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,241
Alright! Let's do it!

568
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,076
A-are you serious?!

569
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,617
Elevation, 300 feet!
Speed, 40 knots! Go ahead!

570
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,475
H-here goes!

571
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,241
Elevation, 200 feet! Speed, 30 knots!

572
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,975
Press the right pedal 10 degrees!

573
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,933
The schoolyard is dead-ahead!
Distance, 500 feet!

574
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:15,784
Hey, Genta! Do you read me?! Genta!

575
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:16,909
Conan?!

576
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:20,659
I'm about to emergency land a helicopter!
Get everyone out of there!

577
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:22,391
Helicopter?

578
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:29,242
Everyone! Run! A helicopter's
about to crash!

579
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,892
Like hell it's gonna crash!

580
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:36,993
We're spinning left!
Hit the right pedal hard!

581
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,265
Oh no! We're in a downwash!

582
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:50,451
It really did crash!

583
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:52,975
Is Conan-kun in there?!

584
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,058
I'm alive!

585
00:40:58,265 --> 00:40:59,617
Conan-kun!

586
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:01,349
Are you all right, Tsuji-san?!

587
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:05,784
The fuel is leaking!

588
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:07,225
- What?!
- What?!

589
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,160
It exploded!

590
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,492
Aren't helicopters expensive?!

591
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:26,241
Don't just the rotors alone
cost 10 million yen?

592
00:41:26,265 --> 00:41:28,265
How many boxed eel lunches is that?

593
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:37,534
I'm glad everyone is all right.

594
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:37,701
"Agasa Hiroshi"
I'm glad everyone is all right.

595
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:39,241
"Agasa Hiroshi"
But, Doc! Conan's unfair!

596
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,325
But, Doc! Conan's unfair!

597
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:44,743
He got to pilot a real helicopter
all by himself...

598
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,784
That's not the issue here!
We just about died, you know!

599
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,325
About that...

600
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,659
Tsuji-san's vitamin eyedrops had
been switched with dilation drops.

601
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,325
Dilation drops?

602
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:02,325
Medicine used to open up the pupils
to treat pseudomyopia and such.

603
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:06,241
Ah. So that's why the sunlight
overwhelmed his eyes...

604
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:10,909
Except the ones Tsuji-san used are
to treat something called "iritis".

605
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:13,034
Iritis?

606
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:14,975
How are they different?

607
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:21,534
Pseudomyopia drops take effect
in 5 minutes, and don't last long.

608
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:27,784
Conversely, iritis drops take a
half hour to work, and last a long time.

609
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:29,534
A long time?

610
00:42:29,558 --> 00:42:34,325
It varies per person, but they usually
dilate the eyes for 10 to 14 days.

611
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:35,534
That long?!

612
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:39,242
Then what about Thursday's
All-American Open?!

613
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:44,034
He probably has no choice but to cancel...

614
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:47,325
Say, when did the culprit
switch the eyedrops?

615
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,367
About that...

616
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:52,784
This morning, after Tsuji-san
took his car out of the garage,

617
00:42:52,808 --> 00:42:56,241
he apparently applied
his eyedrops in the car.

618
00:42:56,265 --> 00:43:00,242
Immediately after, he heard glass break,

619
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:06,034
so he left the eyedrops on the
center console and went back inside.

620
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:10,076
Apparently, a rock had been
thrown through a window.

621
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,241
A rock?

622
00:43:11,265 --> 00:43:13,576
That's what happened to Dr. Agasa!

623
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,160
However, Tsuji-san figured
it was just some kid's prank,

624
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,659
so he had the maids
take care of it and left.

625
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,993
There's no question that
the culprit threw the rock!

626
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:28,534
And Tsuji-san's eyedrops were switched
while he was in the house!

627
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:31,241
Yes. Most likely.

628
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:32,308
Inspector.

629
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:37,241
There is no doubt that
Murakami Joe is responsible.

630
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:39,241
We found this.

631
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:41,641
The 10 of Spades...

632
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:46,118
Mori-kun! "Nine" is the
next one to be attacked!

633
00:43:46,142 --> 00:43:49,242
Do you know anyone with
a "nine" in their name?!

634
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:53,826
- I can't think of anyone. I do know an "eight" though.
- Eight?

635
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,409
Sawaki-san, a sommelier.

636
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:55,993
"Sawaki Kohei"
Sawaki-san, a sommelier.

637
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:58,534
"Sawaki Kohei" His name is Kohei-san, and the
upper part of his "ko" is "eight"!

638
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:01,118
"Ko" His name is Kohei-san, and the
upper part of his "ko" is "eight"!

639
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:04,265
Alright! Let's meet this Sawaki fellow!

640
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:12,293
So this Murakami person is attacking
your acquaintances one by one

641
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:15,126
to get revenge on you, Mori-san?

642
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,293
Yes.

643
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:20,374
Still, you certainly do
seem calm, Mori-san...

644
00:44:20,398 --> 00:44:25,691
Oh, I'm "five", so I still have
lots of time until I get attacked!

645
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,374
Wine...

646
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:35,374
That's called a "wine cooler".
It keeps wine at the proper temperature.

647
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:38,001
There sure is a lot in it!

648
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:41,374
Sawaki-san's family has
an orchard in Yamanashi,

649
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:45,374
and he has hundreds of
bottles of wine stored there!

650
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:47,293
Isn't that right?

651
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:52,374
Yes. I thought I'd keep some for
whenever I open my own restaurant.

652
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,500
I'm quite fond of wine-
may I take a quick look?

653
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:59,084
Certainly.

654
00:44:59,108 --> 00:44:59,959
Oww!

655
00:44:59,983 --> 00:45:01,959
The wood flooring is scratched up!

656
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:05,375
Oh, are you all right? I dropped
a bottle there the other day.

657
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:08,458
Conan-kun. You're not
wearing slippers, so be careful.

658
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:11,374
Margaux, Lafite, Haut-Brion...

659
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:14,374
Such an impressive
collection of top-quality wine!

660
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:17,167
That reminds me, what was it called again?

661
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:20,792
Your treasured... Petr-?

662
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:22,667
You have Chateau Petrus, too?!

663
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:27,792
Chateau Petrus? That's what
Poirot drank in "Death on the Nile"!

664
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:30,876
I did, but I drank it the other day.

665
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,374
Huh?! But I thought it takes years
until it's ready to drink?

666
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,792
I just couldn't help myself.

667
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:41,709
Sawaki-san. We can talk wine another day.

668
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:44,667
Can you tell us your plans for today?

669
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:47,584
Do you know Asahi Katsuyoshi-san?

670
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:52,667
He's a businessman who operates
dozens of restaurants in the city.

671
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:57,584
Oh, I've done a job for
Asahi-san in the past!

672
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:00,584
I hear he's opening Aqua Crystal,
that aquatic park in Tokyo Bay.

673
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:03,500
"Asahi Katsuyoshi" I hear he's opening Aqua Crystal,
that aquatic park in Tokyo Bay.

674
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:03,917
I hear he's opening Aqua Crystal,
that aquatic park in Tokyo Bay.

675
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:09,084
Yes. He's offered to let me
run a restaurant there,

676
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,667
so I have a 3:00 appointment with him.

677
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:13,709
Asahi Katsuyoshi?

678
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,458
- Asahi?
- Hold on, now!

679
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,167
Nine! There's a "nine" in "Asahi"!

680
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,126
"Asahi"
Nine! There's a "nine" in "Asahi"!

681
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,750
"Nine"
Nine! There's a "nine" in "Asahi"!

682
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,374
Nine! There's a "nine" in "Asahi"!

683
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:22,126
Which means he's the next to be attacked.

684
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:26,001
But he only hired me to find his pet cat.

685
00:46:26,025 --> 00:46:28,374
We're not really acquaintances...

686
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,792
Murakami might not think so.

687
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:34,876
In any event, let's protect Sawaki-san
and meet with Asahi-san!

688
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,625
Is that all right, Sawaki-san?

689
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:39,374
Yes. I don't mind.

690
00:46:39,398 --> 00:46:41,374
Then you and Conan-kun-

691
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,917
Are coming.

692
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,042
Conan-kun and I are coming, too!

693
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:48,750
I've had enough of this, Ran!
This isn't a game!

694
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:52,917
That's right! Lots of people are
being attacked because of you!

695
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:55,066
I can't just wait for my turn to come!

696
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:58,317
Ran...

697
00:47:17,398 --> 00:47:19,667
That's Aqua Crystal?

698
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:22,816
- My...
- What a flashy building...

699
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:32,441
Reckless driver!

700
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:40,374
A little bit off. But not too bad.

701
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:43,126
Hey, you! That's dangerous, girly!

702
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,482
- What is?
- Listen, you...

703
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:54,084
Oh, Nana-chan! You too?

704
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:57,750
Oh, Asahi-san invited
you too, Shishido-sensei?!

705
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,374
Pardon me, ma'am, but who are you?

706
00:48:01,398 --> 00:48:03,750
You don't know who I am, mister?!

707
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:07,375
She's Osanai Nana-san, Inspector.
A popular model.

708
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:10,374
Those three are-from left to right-

709
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:12,375
the essayist Nishina-san,

710
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:15,209
the photographer
Shishido Eimei-san, and...

711
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:16,667
Peter Ford.

712
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:23,458
I take it you two are policemen?
And the famous Mori Kogoro-san?

713
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:28,084
You're that famous detective?!

714
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:31,001
I've never seen the real one before!
Shishido-sensei!

715
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:32,816
- Take a picture!
- Peace!

716
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:37,834
Oh, geez. Where'd that anger just now go?

717
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:40,374
This is Sawaki Kohei-san, a sommelier,

718
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:44,584
Mori-san's daughter, Ran-san,
and Edogawa Conan-kun.

719
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:48,458
Oh, you're the "delicious book" girl.

720
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:52,374
Wow! You remember me?!

721
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:56,500
Beautiful wine and women
always remain in people's hearts.

722
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:58,374
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:48:58,398 --> 00:49:01,500
Have you all been
asked here by Asahi-san?

724
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,750
- Yes, for 3:00.
- I'm at 3:00, too!

725
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,876
Same here.

726
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,458
Inspector. Has there been
some sort of incident?

727
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:09,126
Yes, as a matter of fact...

728
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,750
Hey, it's almost 3:00! Let's go already!

729
00:49:12,774 --> 00:49:16,667
Oh, right! Let's head to
the restaurant for now!

730
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:20,317
Huh? Come to think of it,
all four people called here are-

731
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:25,983
Is the monorail the only way
to get to Aqua Crystal?

732
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:36,042
Huh? There's no driver!

733
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:38,374
It looks like you just
need to press this button.

734
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:38,542
"Start" It looks like you just
need to press this button.

735
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:39,733
"Start"

736
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,374
This is quite something!

737
00:49:52,398 --> 00:49:57,167
A-are you not good with hanging
in the air either, Nishina-san?

738
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:01,750
No... It's water I'm afraid of.
I can't swim at all...

739
00:50:01,774 --> 00:50:06,667
Y-yeah, everyone has their little quirks.

740
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:09,417
Even if it's a fact that
your dad shot your mom,

741
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:12,733
are you sure that equals
the truth behind it?

742
00:50:57,233 --> 00:51:01,649
It's like an aquarium! This totally
is an underwater restaurant!

743
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:08,374
A Ferrari F40! How did they
get it in here, I wonder!

744
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,667
I don't seem to see Asahi-san...

745
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:13,709
That's odd, after he invited guests here...

746
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:16,084
Don't tell me Murakami already got to him?

747
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:19,374
What does that mean?!
"Murakami already got to him?"

748
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:22,500
Oh, right! I need to tell you about that...

749
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:25,374
Inspector. I'll go look around the place.

750
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:27,542
- I'll come too.
- Alright.

751
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:31,398
Okay, everyone! Just to be safe,
please sit with your backs to the wall!

752
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:47,500
So this is where the emergency exit is...

753
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,398
"Wine Cellar"

754
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:55,900
This is the only room that's locked...

755
00:51:57,025 --> 00:52:00,374
I see. So that's what's going on...

756
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:03,001
Nothing out of the ordinary.

757
00:52:03,025 --> 00:52:05,542
Which means I could be "six".

758
00:52:05,566 --> 00:52:06,834
Why's that?

759
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:10,374
The "shishi" in "Shishido"
has a "six" in it.

760
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:11,374
So it does!

761
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:14,126
The other three have numbers
in their names, too.

762
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,792
What?

763
00:52:14,816 --> 00:52:17,001
Nana means "seven",

764
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:18,375
"Nishina" has "two",

765
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:21,834
and Ford has the English "four".

766
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:23,167
Yeah...

767
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:25,834
Now we just need a "three"
and "one" to have all the numbers...

768
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:29,374
I know of a "three".
He's right in front of you.

769
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:30,500
Wait, you don't mean-

770
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:30,667
"Shiratori Ninzaburo" (Zabu = three)
Wait, you don't mean-

771
00:52:30,691 --> 00:52:34,001
"Shiratori Ninzaburo" (Zabu = three)
My name is Shiratori Ninzaburo.

772
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:34,293
My name is Shiratori Ninzaburo.

773
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,126
Ninzaburo?

774
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,293
But there's definitely no "one" here...

775
00:52:39,317 --> 00:52:41,293
Shinichi.
(Ichi = one)

776
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:44,792
Do you think Shinichi could be "one"?

777
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:47,042
Is Kudo-kun coming here?!

778
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:50,584
No. But I just got that feeling...

779
00:52:50,608 --> 00:52:51,750
It's true;

780
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:57,750
had I not shrunk, I would've been
intrigued enough to come too!

781
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:01,375
Does that mean “one” does refer to me?

782
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:06,374
Tell me, are any of you connected
with Murakami Joe in any way?

783
00:53:06,398 --> 00:53:08,917
Of course I'm not!

784
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:10,374
Me neither!

785
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,374
I am.

786
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,374
Before I became an essayist, I was
a criminal investigative reporter,

787
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:19,374
and I had done a report
on the Murakami incident.

788
00:53:19,398 --> 00:53:20,959
I'm connected, too.

789
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:26,167
I photographed him for a photo album
called "Portraits of Criminals".

790
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:28,293
Did any trouble occur at the time?

791
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:30,233
Nothing at all.

792
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:35,126
What is it, Nana-san?

793
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,709
He got out of prison eight days ago, right?

794
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:39,834
Yes.

795
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:42,500
Then it's unrelated.

796
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:47,709
Oh, you guys! Getting all serious!
Let's quit talking about this!

797
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,374
More importantly, aren't you the one

798
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:53,458
who wrote that lame book,
"Restaurants in Paris"?!

799
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:57,375
All the restaurants
you recommended in it sucked!

800
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:00,126
- Do you even understand tastes?!
- How rude!

801
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,251
Of course I do!

802
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,374
Then let's see some proof.

803
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:05,209
Proof?

804
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:08,374
I brought this as a gift for Asahi-san,

805
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:11,458
but let's see you guess what wine this is!

806
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:14,941
Blind tasting, huh? All right, then.

807
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:28,374
This elegant, violet fragrance...

808
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,876
This velvety texture going down...

809
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,959
Chambertin, the beloved drink
of Napoleon, Emperor of the French.

810
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,792
I got you!

811
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:42,876
As if I'd ever buy something
that cheap as a gift for someone!

812
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,398
Then what is this?!

813
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:49,375
- You're a sommelier.
- Yes.

814
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:52,900
Tell this fraud of an essayist the answer.

815
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:14,959
Moulin-à-Vent, Beaujolais, yes?

816
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:16,209
Correct!

817
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,500
No way! This is a Beaujolais?!

818
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:22,374
High-quality Beaujolais,
when left to age for a long time,

819
00:55:22,398 --> 00:55:26,001
can produce top-quality
Bourgogne-like flavors and fragrances.

820
00:55:26,025 --> 00:55:32,066
Now do you get it? I suggest you
call it quits as a "gourmet essayist"!

821
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,126
Now I feel like having some wine, too!

822
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,001
Let's all have some, then!
I'll get the stuff!

823
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:42,375
I'll have some beer. Where's the kitchen?

824
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:43,542
That way.

825
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:45,876
Alright! Lead the way, brat!

826
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,209
Okay!

827
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:49,275
Who're you callin' a brat?!

828
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,834
Ah! Here we go!

829
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:55,293
Good news, brat! There's juice here, too!

830
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,209
Really?! I'm so happy!

831
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:58,774
Enough with the brat stuff!

832
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:06,001
Here, Ran-neechan!

833
00:56:06,025 --> 00:56:08,374
Thanks!

834
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,441
Oops!

835
00:56:10,524 --> 00:56:14,374
It really is as delicious
as you say, Sawaki-san!

836
00:56:14,398 --> 00:56:16,293
Sawaki-san! How about another glass?

837
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:19,374
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll have some mineral water.

838
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:20,667
Thanks!

839
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:22,374
You're not having beer?

840
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:27,374
Of course not! There's no telling
when Murakami could strike!

841
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:30,001
Here you are, Inspector!

842
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:32,334
Here, Conan-kun. You can have mine.

843
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:34,917
T-that's okay! I'll get another one!

844
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:37,816
Hey! Don't be scampering around, now!

845
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:50,542
The mineral water is in the
bottom drawer of the fridge!

846
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:52,334
Oh, thanks.

847
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:55,834
I saw a rare seasoning here,
so I gave it a taste.

848
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:58,691
- Is your juice up here, Conan-kun?
- Yeah!

849
00:57:01,774 --> 00:57:06,398
What's taking Asahi-san so long?
What could he be up to?!

850
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:12,398
W-what's going on?! What's wrong?!

851
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,293
Just joking!

852
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:17,834
Ugh...

853
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:21,441
Ford-san! Please don't
joke around at a time like this!

854
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:28,001
Incidentally, why are
you all here today, anyway?

855
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:30,709
I got a call from his secretary.

856
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:35,374
Said Asahi-san was a fan of mine
and wanted to meet with me.

857
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:39,542
Maybe he wants me to help
promote this place or something?

858
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:42,374
I also received a call from his secretary.

859
00:57:42,398 --> 00:57:44,375
I got the same invitation.

860
00:57:44,399 --> 00:57:47,750
I even got a present from him!

861
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:49,375
Here! This nail polish!

862
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,667
It's made in France and super expensive!

863
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:56,375
- You too, Nishina-san?
- Yeah, me too!

864
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:58,709
What're you doing there, Nana-chan?

865
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:02,374
I drew on the wine cork
with nail polish! Isn't it cute?

866
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:04,834
What is it? A raccoon dog?!

867
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:08,375
Oh, you're such a meanie! It's a cat!

868
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:12,398
Sawaki-san. This is addressed to you.
I found it on the ground.

869
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:16,374
“Sawaki Kohei-san...”

870
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:20,667
"I may be late, so please treat everyone
to any bottle of wine you want

871
00:58:20,691 --> 00:58:25,374
from Rack M-18 in the wine cellar."

872
00:58:25,398 --> 00:58:29,251
"The key is in an envelope
on the checkout counter."

873
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:33,374
"Thanks. -Asahi Katsuyoshi"

874
00:58:33,398 --> 00:58:37,959
Was that paper there when
I picked up the juice earlier?

875
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:40,750
Hey! I wanna see the wine cellar!

876
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:42,209
Me too!

877
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:45,542
I'd like to see what wine there is, too!

878
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:47,816
Then let's all go together!

879
00:58:58,566 --> 00:59:01,458
- My word!
- What a sight!

880
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:05,374
- It's cool in here...
- No, it's almost too warm!

881
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:11,374
A temperature between 10º to 14º C
is ideal for preserving wine,

882
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:15,374
but it's up to 17º C in here.

883
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:18,792
Just look at these, Inspector!
They're all rare wines!

884
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:23,374
Romanée-Conti, La Tache, Le Pin,
Cote-Rotie, Clos du Mesnil...

885
00:59:23,398 --> 00:59:24,458
Just amazing!

886
00:59:24,482 --> 00:59:28,374
Shelf M-18...

887
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,374
There it is!

888
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:30,441
Look out!

889
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,709
A booby-trap!

890
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:36,608
Mister! Inspector!

891
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:42,375
This is just like the one
that hit me in the side!

892
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:43,876
Inspector!

893
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,334
The crossbow is set up here!

894
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:48,375
An 8 of Spades...

895
00:59:48,399 --> 00:59:52,458
So it was Murakami who set this up,
and wrote that letter!

896
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:57,233
If so, why would he skip nine
and go after Sawaki-san, who's eight?

897
00:59:58,358 --> 00:59:59,375
It couldn't be!

898
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:03,275
Inspector! Let's evacuate from
this building for the time being!

899
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:12,084
Huh? It's closed.
Was the entrance not here?

900
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,458
No, this is the place.

901
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:16,334
If we're leaving, can I get my coat first?

902
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:17,482
Go ahead.

903
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:29,876
Asahi-san!

904
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,374
The 9 of Spades! It was Murakami!

905
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:35,625
Inspector! I can't open this door,
it has an electronic lock!

906
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:37,667
What?! Alright, I'll call for help!

907
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:38,374
"No Service"
What?! Alright, I'll call for help!

908
01:00:38,398 --> 01:00:40,233
"No Service"
No good! We're out of service range!

909
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:44,042
It's been cut! Damn it!

910
01:00:44,066 --> 01:00:46,774
Inspector! I'm gonna
check the emergency exit!

911
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,374
What?!

912
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:56,066
It's blocked with cement!

913
01:00:57,398 --> 01:01:01,374
This is your fault! We have
nothing to do with this!

914
01:01:01,398 --> 01:01:03,691
Yeah! What do you have
to say for yourself?!

915
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:09,959
The fact Murakami didn't
go out of numerical order

916
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:13,584
means you're next, Nana-chan!

917
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:15,417
Q-quit it!

918
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:19,375
Why do I have to be targeted by
some man I've never even heard of?!

919
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:22,126
But something bugs you, right?

920
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,667
Earlier, you...

921
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:27,167
He got out of prison eight days ago, right?

922
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,542
Yes.

923
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:31,374
I already told you, it was unrelated!

924
01:01:31,398 --> 01:01:36,608
We will determine if it's unrelated
or not. Please talk to us.

925
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:40,774
Three months ago...

926
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:47,358
Apparently!

927
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:08,209
We didn't collide,
but I got scared and drove off!

928
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:10,876
Did the person have
an off-road motorcycle?!

929
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,667
No, it was a regular motorcycle.

930
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:18,542
Inspector. Nana-san is right.
It's unrelated to what's happening now.

931
01:02:18,566 --> 01:02:21,374
More importantly, we need
to figure a way out of here!

932
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:25,792
Yeah. We might find an exit
if we search the entire building.

933
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:29,374
Then let's split up and look, too.

934
01:02:29,398 --> 01:02:31,293
Guess there's no other choice.

935
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:33,625
Listen! Ran and Conan, you stay here!

936
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,293
You remain here too, Nana-san!

937
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:37,441
Okay...

938
01:03:05,774 --> 01:03:10,293
What's taking everyone so long?
Can't they find an exit?

939
01:03:10,317 --> 01:03:14,374
Don't worry! I'm sure they'll
find one and be right back!

940
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:16,398
I'll just do some searching, too!

941
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:22,374
You were told to stay here!

942
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,375
Honestly! You're so
curious about everything...

943
01:03:25,399 --> 01:03:26,983
But!

944
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:33,374
A power outage?!

945
01:03:33,398 --> 01:03:35,959
What?! What's going on?!
Why are the lights out?!

946
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,358
Luminescent paint!

947
01:03:41,858 --> 01:03:44,374
- Help!
- Stay there, Nana-san!

948
01:03:44,398 --> 01:03:46,233
Don't tell me this blackout-

949
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:51,084
What?! What happened?!

950
01:03:51,108 --> 01:03:54,251
- What was that scream?!
- Inspector!

951
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:57,126
- Mori-kun! The electrical room!
- Right!

952
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,398
Nana-san?!

953
01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:05,108
Is this it?

954
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:10,150
Nana-san!

955
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,374
What the-?!

956
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:18,398
- Nana-san!
- Move aside!

957
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,792
She's dead!

958
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:23,374
The 7 of Spades, and a Joker...

959
01:04:23,398 --> 01:04:27,209
It's Murakami! Murakami's here,
inside this building!

960
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:28,374
Damn it!

961
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,667
I'll go check around!

962
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:32,649
Mori-san! It's dangerous to
go alone! I'll come with you!

963
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:35,625
Shishido-san.

964
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:38,084
Please cease your photography.

965
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,375
Why's that?

966
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:43,375
Since help can't come right away,
you'll have to do the autopsy,

967
01:04:43,399 --> 01:04:47,584
but won't you need to photograph
the scene of the crime first?

968
01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:49,417
Y-you have a point...

969
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:52,792
Then I expect you to hand them over
to the police later on.

970
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:55,398
Yes, but of course!

971
01:04:57,398 --> 01:05:02,084
But how did Murakami manage
to do this in pitch darkness?

972
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:05,750
Luminescent paint.
Nana-san's fingernails were glowing.

973
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:07,293
What?!

974
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:12,983
I see! Luminescent paint was added
to the nail polish she was given!

975
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:20,374
Her middle nail...

976
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:24,667
Hey, Inspector!
Nana-san's left fingernail is weird!

977
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:28,584
The nail polish came off!
Or, wait... did her nail break off?

978
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:31,542
I think that's a press-on nail
that came off.

979
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:32,750
Press-on?

980
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,667
They're not real fingernails.

981
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:39,167
They come in various designs,
and you glue them to your nails.

982
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:45,374
Oh? So it came off by chance, then?

983
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:47,374
Here we are!

984
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:50,084
It doesn't seem related to her murder...

985
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,733
Oh...

986
01:05:54,275 --> 01:05:59,625
She was grabbed with a left hand!
And pretty forcefully, at that!

987
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:02,709
Which means... the killer is right-handed!

988
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:07,667
If I remember right,
Murakami... is left-handed!

989
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:10,834
It wasn't Murakami who killed Nana-san!

990
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:14,293
Wait a minute! A while back, the killer...

991
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:16,774
Think back! Remember!

992
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:21,667
He's right-handed!

993
01:06:21,691 --> 01:06:25,858
What the hell?! I've been making
a huge mistake this whole time!

994
01:06:28,482 --> 01:06:31,750
Inspector! No luck!
Murakami's nowhere to be found!

995
01:06:31,774 --> 01:06:34,374
Could he have already escaped?

996
01:06:34,398 --> 01:06:37,167
That can't be! There's no way out!

997
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:40,126
He must be hiding somewhere still!

998
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,709
No... Murakami isn't the killer.
It's someone in here!

999
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:47,917
Who?! Who killed Nana-san?!

1000
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:50,233
Come to think of it, the killer...

1001
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:55,691
...kicked the can of juice
I left on the floor!

1002
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,709
The contents have spilled onto the floor.

1003
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:05,959
I'm certain there was about half
left in it when I set it down.

1004
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:08,876
So if the killer kicked the can...

1005
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,374
...the juice must've flown out
and stained the killer's pants!

1006
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:17,733
Nana-san's killer is one of these four men!

1007
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:29,374
Him?! But why?!

1008
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:34,042
I'm sorry, Sawaki-san.
Because of me, Asahi-san was murdered,

1009
01:07:34,066 --> 01:07:36,667
and you never got to discuss
running his restaurant...

1010
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:41,001
Not at all. I was going
to turn him down, anyway.

1011
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:46,374
Actually, I've decided to quit my
current job and return to the country.

1012
01:07:46,398 --> 01:07:51,876
I'm an only son, so I need
to take care of my parents.

1013
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,374
In any case, we'd be wise
not to act rashly now.

1014
01:07:55,398 --> 01:07:56,667
Especially you, Shishido-san.

1015
01:07:56,691 --> 01:08:03,374
Yeah, I know. I'm next, right?
I'll be extra careful not to get killed.

1016
01:08:03,398 --> 01:08:08,374
Inspector! I refuse to die!
I will get out of here alive!

1017
01:08:08,398 --> 01:08:11,524
Wait a minute! Could it be that he...

1018
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,750
What're you up to now?!

1019
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:36,334
I thought everyone might be thirsty...

1020
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:39,667
You idiot! Don't be
running around on your own!

1021
01:08:39,691 --> 01:08:42,584
There's no telling where
Murakami might be hiding!

1022
01:08:42,608 --> 01:08:45,709
But there's no number in my name, so...

1023
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:46,667
Yeesh!

1024
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:48,584
Here you go!

1025
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:50,750
Here you go, Sawaki-san!

1026
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:51,417
Thank you.

1027
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:53,374
Hey, brat! Gimme some too!

1028
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:54,566
Sure!

1029
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:59,317
Japanese water really is delicious!

1030
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:02,667
That's great!

1031
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:05,209
I was right! No doubt about it!

1032
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:07,374
But there's no proof.

1033
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:09,608
Come to think of it, where is it?!

1034
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:23,398
I found the proof!

1035
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,374
What was that?!

1036
01:09:30,398 --> 01:09:32,084
There appears to have been
an explosion somewhere!

1037
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:34,792
Shiratori-kun! Shishido-san
is next! Protect Shishido-san!

1038
01:09:34,816 --> 01:09:35,458
Yes, sir!

1039
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:39,374
Shishido-san!
Where are you, Shishido-san?!

1040
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:41,374
- Right here.
- Put that out!

1041
01:09:41,398 --> 01:09:43,275
Do you want to die?!

1042
01:09:46,566 --> 01:09:50,275
I'm "two", so I won't get
attacked for a long time!

1043
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:54,374
Sawaki-san! Are you hurt?!

1044
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:57,374
N-no. Do you suppose
I'll be targeted again?

1045
01:09:57,398 --> 01:10:00,167
I- I'm not sure...

1046
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,398
Thank you! Emergency lights!

1047
01:10:08,816 --> 01:10:10,398
W-what the?!

1048
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:17,066
H-h-help! I can't swi-!

1049
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:37,398
Here, grab on!

1050
01:10:40,774 --> 01:10:43,608
Heya, brat! Glad to see you're alive!

1051
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:50,542
Huh?! Ran! Where are you?! Ran!

1052
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:51,858
Don't tell me she's...

1053
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:57,542
Wait, Conan! Where are you going?!

1054
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:59,398
Ran! Where are you?!

1055
01:11:07,398 --> 01:11:08,482
Ran!

1056
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:20,126
Ran! Everything's okay now! Calm down!

1057
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,900
S- Shinichi?

1058
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:26,233
Conan-kun!

1059
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:33,876
It's no good!

1060
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,566
Oh, yeah! My Elasticity Suspenders!

1061
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:40,374
Crap! My leg's stuck!

1062
01:11:40,398 --> 01:11:43,649
Dammit! Oh no! Can't breathe!

1063
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:03,441
R- Ran!

1064
01:12:09,066 --> 01:12:10,959
Hey! Ran! Ran!

1065
01:12:10,983 --> 01:12:12,317
Damn it!

1066
01:12:16,108 --> 01:12:18,398
I'm free! I gotta hurry!

1067
01:12:58,066 --> 01:13:00,691
Hey! Ran! Ran! Say something!

1068
01:13:04,398 --> 01:13:07,667
D- Dad...

1069
01:13:07,691 --> 01:13:10,816
Thank Conan.

1070
01:13:12,398 --> 01:13:14,733
Thank you, Conan-kun...

1071
01:13:15,649 --> 01:13:19,209
No, uhh...

1072
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,293
What's wrong?!

1073
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:23,167
I seem to have reopened my wound!

1074
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,375
What?!

1075
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,374
Look! Over there!

1076
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:28,374
The 6 to 2 of Spades!

1077
01:13:28,398 --> 01:13:32,876
Damn it! Is he planning to kill us
all at once here?! Screw that!

1078
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,374
But, at this rate, it is going to happen.
Because there's no way out!

1079
01:13:37,398 --> 01:13:39,374
- I know a way out!
- What?!

1080
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:41,458
You know, the exploded windows!

1081
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:45,375
Yeah! We can go
into the sea through them!

1082
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:48,209
N-no! I can't!

1083
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:51,374
Quit bein' a sissy! I'll take you with me!

1084
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:53,209
Then I'll take you, little boy!

1085
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:55,375
I'll be fine by myself!

1086
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:59,398
And I'll take you. Think you
got a little bit left in you?!

1087
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,374
- I'll help you, Inspector.
- Thanks...

1088
01:14:02,398 --> 01:14:05,317
Then I'll lead the way! Let's go!

1089
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:10,358
Here we go! Deep breath!

1090
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:14,209
Hold on tight and don't let go now!

1091
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:15,524
R-right!

1092
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:51,398
Here! Grab my hand!

1093
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:01,025
- Take Ran!
- Right!

1094
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:09,625
We're saved, aren't we?

1095
01:15:09,649 --> 01:15:12,066
Yes. We're safe now!

1096
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:15,458
Nishina! Nishina!

1097
01:15:15,482 --> 01:15:17,374
Hey! Say something!

1098
01:15:17,398 --> 01:15:22,374
I'll give him CPR!
I'm a certified lifeguard!

1099
01:15:22,398 --> 01:15:28,126
Hold it! Detective Shiratori!
You give him CPR!

1100
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,750
Huh? No, I didn't say anything-

1101
01:15:30,774 --> 01:15:33,374
Do it now, Shiratori!

1102
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:35,025
Understood!

1103
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,608
Huh?

1104
01:15:46,398 --> 01:15:47,542
Mori-kun?

1105
01:15:47,566 --> 01:15:48,625
Inspector!

1106
01:15:48,649 --> 01:15:52,750
The person behind this string
of incidents is not Murakami Joe!

1107
01:15:52,774 --> 01:15:54,334
Say what?!

1108
01:15:54,358 --> 01:15:59,374
Because the person who shot
Dr. Agasa and killed Nana-san

1109
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:01,126
was right-handed!

1110
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:02,524
Right-handed?!

1111
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:05,441
Y-you're all right!

1112
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:12,375
The real culprit most likely
met Murakami after he was released,

1113
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:15,374
learned things from him,
like how I shot him 10 years ago

1114
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:21,084
and that he was once a gambling
dealer nicknamed "Joker",

1115
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:23,458
and decided to use him.

1116
01:16:23,482 --> 01:16:24,417
Use?

1117
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:30,792
Yes. The killer realized that he
and the people he wanted to kill

1118
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:34,792
all had numbers in their names.

1119
01:16:34,816 --> 01:16:39,667
So he came up with the idea
of combining these "name numbers"

1120
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:44,209
with playing cards to
pin his crimes on Murakami.

1121
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:47,876
Then the reason Eri-san,
Dr. Agasa, and I were attacked

1122
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,792
was to act as camouflage to make us think

1123
01:16:49,816 --> 01:16:52,042
Murakami was getting
revenge against you?!

1124
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,458
That's right.

1125
01:16:53,482 --> 01:16:57,126
Then who did the culprit
really want to kill?!

1126
01:16:57,150 --> 01:17:00,001
Asahi-san and Nana-san.

1127
01:17:00,025 --> 01:17:01,458
And Tsuji-san.

1128
01:17:01,482 --> 01:17:04,917
Given that the method used against him-
switching his eyedrops-

1129
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:11,001
had a very high probability of being fatal,
there's likely no doubt.

1130
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:13,126
Mori-kun! Who is the killer, then?!

1131
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:15,500
The killer is among us.

1132
01:17:15,524 --> 01:17:17,025
What?!

1133
01:17:19,398 --> 01:17:23,126
Come to think of it,
didn't Nana-san humiliate you?

1134
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:25,374
N-no! I didn't kill her!

1135
01:17:25,398 --> 01:17:28,792
That's right. You were to be killed.

1136
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:31,667
As you can't swim, the killer
attempted to drown you

1137
01:17:31,691 --> 01:17:35,667
by blowing up the underwater restaurant.

1138
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:37,458
Say, Detective Shiratori.

1139
01:17:37,482 --> 01:17:43,167
When you gave CPR to Nishina-san,
what was the first thing you did?

1140
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,458
What did I do?

1141
01:17:44,482 --> 01:17:47,375
You're supposed to tilt
the head back, lift the throat up,

1142
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:49,750
and keep the airway open!

1143
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:53,374
Then, what would happen if you
hadn't kept the airway open,

1144
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:57,374
and only pretended to give CPR,
while shutting the nose and mouth?

1145
01:17:57,398 --> 01:18:00,774
That'd kill him, obviously!

1146
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:04,084
Y-you're not saying...

1147
01:18:04,108 --> 01:18:07,542
Yes. The person who murdered
Asahi-san and Nana-san

1148
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:10,834
and tried to kill
Tsuji-san and Nishina-san...

1149
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:14,542
It was you, Sawaki Kohei-san!

1150
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:17,834
Mori-san! I was attacked
with a crossbow too, you know!

1151
01:18:17,858 --> 01:18:21,374
You had set that up beforehand.

1152
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:27,209
After you murdered Asahi-san
here last night, that is!

1153
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:30,374
Then the letter that was
under the table...

1154
01:18:30,398 --> 01:18:33,042
And the secretary that called us all...

1155
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:34,876
Sawaki-san was behind it all.

1156
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,458
Including Nana-san's
luminescent nail polish, of course!

1157
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:42,108
Motive! What was his motive?!

1158
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:47,374
Something to do with ageusia, most likely.

1159
01:18:47,398 --> 01:18:49,917
Ageusia?

1160
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:53,667
That's when you can't taste
food and drinks anymore, right?

1161
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:57,608
Yes. He suffers from this ageusia.

1162
01:19:01,398 --> 01:19:08,209
Apparently, ageusia is caused
by stress or external head injuries.

1163
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:09,709
External head injuries?

1164
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:14,374
Then Sawaki-san was the person
Nana-san got in an accident with?!

1165
01:19:14,398 --> 01:19:16,374
H-h-hold on now!

1166
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:18,667
You claim he lost his sense of taste,

1167
01:19:18,691 --> 01:19:22,374
but he named Nana-san's
wine brand correctly!

1168
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:27,126
He could tell the brand by the
wine's color and scent alone.

1169
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,374
That's possible?

1170
01:19:28,398 --> 01:19:32,542
After it happened,
Sawaki-san continued as a sommelier,

1171
01:19:32,566 --> 01:19:35,374
relying on vision and smell alone.

1172
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:41,584
But it was an affront to his aesthetic
desire to be a perfect sommelier.

1173
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:46,374
That's why he decided to leave
his position and return to the country.

1174
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:49,959
But not before getting revenge
on Nana-san and everyone else

1175
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:53,566
who had caused him to
lose his sense of taste!

1176
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:57,374
It must have been quite hard to accept.

1177
01:19:57,398 --> 01:20:02,293
Enough to make him break the
bottle of wine he treasured and saved

1178
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:06,375
for the day he would finally
open his own restaurant.

1179
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,084
Then that mark on his floor was-

1180
01:20:10,108 --> 01:20:13,374
But how did you manage
to figure all this out?

1181
01:20:13,398 --> 01:20:17,374
Yes. It was because he tried
to taste some seasoning.

1182
01:20:17,398 --> 01:20:24,001
What he tried was chili powder.

1183
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:27,209
People like sommeliers who
use their tongues for a living

1184
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:31,334
don't put irritants or stimulants
in their mouths, you see.

1185
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:36,293
I was able to confirm that he
had lost his sense of taste

1186
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:39,667
when I had Conan give him
some mineral water.

1187
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:41,667
Mineral water?

1188
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:47,374
The glass that Conan
gave you had salt in it.

1189
01:20:47,398 --> 01:20:51,374
And I drank it without realizing it?

1190
01:20:51,398 --> 01:20:54,709
It's true that I suffer from ageusia.

1191
01:20:54,733 --> 01:21:00,375
But that hardly proves
that I murdered Nana-san.

1192
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:06,066
But there is proof. In either
your left or right jacket pocket.

1193
01:21:11,691 --> 01:21:14,458
That's the cork Nana-san drew on!

1194
01:21:14,482 --> 01:21:18,667
Nana-san had that cork on her
until just before she was murdered.

1195
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:22,374
So what was it doing in your pocket?

1196
01:21:22,398 --> 01:21:26,500
It's because when you
stabbed her from behind,

1197
01:21:26,524 --> 01:21:28,542
Nana-san spun around and grabbed at you,

1198
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:32,458
at which time the cork
slipped inside your pocket!

1199
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:37,374
The press-on nail on the floor
likely came off at this time.

1200
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:43,834
How ironic that a wine cork
should prove a sommelier's crime.

1201
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:45,709
But there's one more thing!

1202
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:50,816
And it's most likely still
asleep in one of your pockets!

1203
01:21:54,398 --> 01:21:58,876
The final Ace of Spades
that matches those there.

1204
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,399
The card for Kudo Shinichi!

1205
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:06,150
The Ace of Spades!

1206
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:20,667
Mori-san. It's all as you say.

1207
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:24,293
Three months ago, on my way
home from the restaurant,

1208
01:22:24,317 --> 01:22:28,709
I nearly collided with her car,
and fell off my motorcycle.

1209
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:33,458
A while after, I suddenly
lost all sense of taste.

1210
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:38,126
The doctor said stress
might also be the cause.

1211
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:42,374
Having lost all hope, I decided
to give up being a sommelier

1212
01:22:42,398 --> 01:22:45,084
and enact revenge on the cause
of the accident, Osanai Nana,

1213
01:22:45,108 --> 01:22:50,398
and the causes of my stress,
Asahi, Tsuji, and Nishina.

1214
01:22:51,482 --> 01:22:54,917
But what did Asahi-san
and the others do to you?!

1215
01:22:54,941 --> 01:22:59,917
Asahi caught wind of a "wine boom"
and used his vast fortune

1216
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,374
to buy up all the
rare foreign wine available!

1217
01:23:02,398 --> 01:23:04,792
And he couldn't even take care of it right!

1218
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:09,126
Nishina! You pretended to be a gourmet,
wrote know-it-all books,

1219
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,667
and planted incorrect information
about wine in readers' minds!

1220
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:14,834
And Tsuji Hiroki!

1221
01:23:14,858 --> 01:23:18,917
He sullied my dignity as a sommelier!

1222
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:24,025
Four months ago, I attended
a party he held at his home.

1223
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:29,374
Oh! You're here!

1224
01:23:29,398 --> 01:23:31,941
Here's a good sommelier badge for you!

1225
01:23:33,398 --> 01:23:35,001
And for your tastevin!

1226
01:23:35,025 --> 01:23:37,524
Oh! Lookin' sharp!

1227
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:45,375
You tried to kill Tsuji-san for that?!

1228
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:50,334
"For that"?! You can't possibly
understand how I felt then!

1229
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,625
I sought dignity, honor, and pride
as a sommelier in my work!

1230
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:58,750
And he stomped on all of it
with his grimy feet!

1231
01:23:58,774 --> 01:24:01,792
Did you kill Murakami Joe?

1232
01:24:01,816 --> 01:24:03,334
Yeah.

1233
01:24:03,358 --> 01:24:07,374
The day he was released from prison,
I just happened to meet him

1234
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:09,917
in front of the Mori Detective Agency.

1235
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:13,209
That's the day he went to play mahjong!

1236
01:24:13,233 --> 01:24:16,458
I thought I might be able to use Murakami,

1237
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:19,667
so I invited him over
as an acquaintance of Mori-san.

1238
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:23,750
Way back when, he did hold
a grudge against Mori-san,

1239
01:24:23,774 --> 01:24:28,042
but now he wanted to apologize
for everything, so he went to see him.

1240
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:31,293
That's when I came up with the idea
of using playing card numbers

1241
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:34,625
to camouflage my crimes.

1242
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:38,750
Killing Murakami while
he was wasted was easy.

1243
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:43,126
So you had no grudge against Mori-san
or Inspector Megure, then?!

1244
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,293
Exactly.

1245
01:24:44,317 --> 01:24:46,750
So you brought me and Shishido-san here...

1246
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:49,417
...because you needed
a "four" and a "six"?!

1247
01:24:49,441 --> 01:24:50,709
That's right.

1248
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:53,375
I figured three and five-
Mori-san and Detective Shiratori-

1249
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:58,375
would naturally come if I mentioned
Asahi-san invited me here.

1250
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:03,542
I had actually hoped "one" -
Kudo Shinichi-would come too...

1251
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:06,374
...but unfortunately,
my wish didn't come true.

1252
01:25:06,398 --> 01:25:11,167
Did you ever stop to consider
if innocent people were killed?!

1253
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:15,750
I blew up the underwater restaurant
simply to kill Nishina.

1254
01:25:15,774 --> 01:25:19,792
I didn't give a damn whether
any of the others lived or died.

1255
01:25:19,816 --> 01:25:23,417
This place would collapse afterward,
Murakami would go missing,

1256
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:26,792
and it'd all remain an unsolved mystery.

1257
01:25:26,816 --> 01:25:29,126
This place would collapse?!

1258
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:33,126
Sawaki-san. There's nowhere
to run now. Give yourself up.

1259
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:36,001
Detective Shiratori! Seize Sawaki-san!

1260
01:25:36,025 --> 01:25:36,398
What?!

1261
01:25:43,317 --> 01:25:44,482
W-what the?!

1262
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:48,374
Oh no!

1263
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:49,625
Come on!

1264
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:50,858
Crap!

1265
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:56,375
Huh? Why does Sawaki-san have Ran?

1266
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,876
What are you talking about?!
You just exposed his crimes!

1267
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,399
Huh? I did?

1268
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:06,542
Stay where you are! Move and she's dead!

1269
01:26:06,566 --> 01:26:10,398
Damn it! Ran's too out of it
to use her karate-

1270
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:39,542
That last explosion has caused
the building to lose its balance!

1271
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:41,209
Ran! Where are you?!

1272
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:42,209
Up there!

1273
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:43,750
Where is he going?!

1274
01:26:43,774 --> 01:26:45,709
He plans to escape in a helicopter!

1275
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:46,900
What?!

1276
01:26:48,649 --> 01:26:52,500
He called one here using the
secretary's name so he could escape!

1277
01:26:52,524 --> 01:26:53,834
That's what he thinks!

1278
01:26:53,858 --> 01:26:56,667
Wait! Mori-kun! Leave the rest to us-

1279
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:57,709
Conan-kun!

1280
01:26:57,733 --> 01:27:01,374
- You guys evacuate immediately!
- I-I can't swim!

1281
01:27:01,398 --> 01:27:06,374
Don't worry! We'll find a plank
or something and get you to shore!

1282
01:27:06,398 --> 01:27:08,398
- Let's go, Shiratori-kun!
- Yes, sir!

1283
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,417
- Which way?!
- Up the stairs!

1284
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:17,398
The elevator, huh?!

1285
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:27,150
Mori-kun! This way!

1286
01:27:28,398 --> 01:27:30,108
Hurry! Hurry!

1287
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:46,584
Inspector. How good is
Detective Shiratori with a gun?

1288
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:49,398
He's as bad as I am.

1289
01:27:56,441 --> 01:27:59,649
W-what in the world's going on?!

1290
01:28:03,233 --> 01:28:05,374
What are you doing?! Land!

1291
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:09,317
W-who is this guy?!
Why does he have a knife?!

1292
01:28:15,482 --> 01:28:19,941
Dammit! Why doesn't that
elevator go to the roof?!

1293
01:28:22,398 --> 01:28:26,374
Get down here now!
I'm the one who ordered the chopper!

1294
01:28:26,398 --> 01:28:28,500
Emergency! Emergency!

1295
01:28:28,524 --> 01:28:33,375
A man with a knife has a girl hostage
on the Aqua Crystal heliport!

1296
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,858
And the building is in danger
of collapsing! Send help at once!

1297
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:42,084
Ran!

1298
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,334
Stay back!

1299
01:28:43,358 --> 01:28:45,209
Any closer and she's dead!

1300
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:48,251
Stop this, Sawaki-san!

1301
01:28:48,275 --> 01:28:50,458
Let Ran-san go! Let her go or I'll shoot!

1302
01:28:50,482 --> 01:28:51,917
Amusing!

1303
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:54,150
Go ahead and shoot, if you dare!

1304
01:28:56,025 --> 01:28:59,126
His hands are shaking!
He'll hit Ran if he shoots!

1305
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:02,042
Shiratori-kun! Don't!

1306
01:29:02,066 --> 01:29:04,042
Inspector! Are you all right?!

1307
01:29:04,066 --> 01:29:07,584
Escaping in a helicopter
won't help you! Let Ran-kun go!

1308
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:11,042
Shut up! I'm gonna take
this girl and go kill Tsuji!

1309
01:29:11,066 --> 01:29:12,374
Tsuji-san?!

1310
01:29:12,398 --> 01:29:14,876
He can't be in the
All-American Open now!

1311
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,500
Isn't that enough?!

1312
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:19,374
Nope! I'm going to kill him,
and then I'm going to die!

1313
01:29:19,398 --> 01:29:21,398
And she's coming with me!

1314
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:28,374
S- Sawaki-san...

1315
01:29:28,398 --> 01:29:31,625
Shinichi... Help me...

1316
01:29:31,649 --> 01:29:33,374
Shinichi...

1317
01:29:33,398 --> 01:29:36,900
If he runs off with Ran, he'll kill her!

1318
01:29:44,816 --> 01:29:49,374
This is bad! If this keeps up,
we'll all be goners, not just Ran!

1319
01:29:49,398 --> 01:29:51,374
Hand over the gun.

1320
01:29:51,398 --> 01:29:52,126
What?!

1321
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:53,941
I'll stab her!

1322
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:02,293
Hey, Shiratori. Gimme the gun.

1323
01:30:02,317 --> 01:30:04,374
I said give it to me.

1324
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:07,374
Yeah, right! I can't give it to you!

1325
01:30:07,398 --> 01:30:09,774
What're you doing?! Hurry it up!

1326
01:30:11,398 --> 01:30:13,108
A-all right!

1327
01:30:22,524 --> 01:30:26,084
Boy! You bring it here!

1328
01:30:26,108 --> 01:30:28,792
Do you want this girl to die?!

1329
01:30:28,816 --> 01:30:32,417
N-no! Don't make a kid do
something that dangerous!

1330
01:30:32,441 --> 01:30:33,774
Hey!

1331
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:41,259
C'mon! Bring it here!

1332
01:30:41,283 --> 01:30:43,507
N-no!

1333
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:47,009
Conan-kun... D-don't give-

1334
01:30:47,033 --> 01:30:49,531
Don't give it to him!

1335
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:55,907
'Atta boy! Now bring it here!

1336
01:31:01,531 --> 01:31:03,116
Hurry up!

1337
01:31:04,366 --> 01:31:06,531
I said bring it here now!

1338
01:31:08,866 --> 01:31:14,199
Ah! Now I see! That's why the old guy...

1339
01:31:33,158 --> 01:31:34,531
Shi-

1340
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,782
Shinichi?

1341
01:31:50,949 --> 01:31:53,925
Damn it! Hey! Get up! Hey!

1342
01:31:53,949 --> 01:31:55,824
Hey! Hey!

1343
01:31:57,699 --> 01:32:07,175

this world, I'd find it for you ♪

1347
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:17,633
That was a close one, Ran...

1348
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,717
N-now I see! So that's why Mori-san

1349
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:21,717
shot her back then!

1350
01:32:21,741 --> 01:32:23,842
It wasn't to stop the killer,

1351
01:32:23,866 --> 01:32:26,134
but to save the hostage!

1352
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:29,049
Yes. A hostage shot in the leg

1353
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:33,883
is just a burden to a fleeing criminal.

1354
01:32:33,907 --> 01:32:36,550
It was to save Mom...

1355
01:32:36,574 --> 01:32:39,842
So that was the truth, then?

1356
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:41,717

1359
01:32:47,283 --> 01:32:49,467
You're under arrest for murder,

1360
01:32:49,491 --> 01:32:51,507
bodily harm, kidnapping, and more!

1361
01:32:51,531 --> 01:32:54,074
♪ I beg of you,
please confess your worries to me ♪

1362
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:05,199
Let go! Let me die!

1363
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:09,842
I'm not letting you die!

1364
01:33:09,866 --> 01:33:14,158
I'm gonna make you understand
the weight of what you've done!

1365
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,883
Talk about a close call!

1366
01:33:44,907 --> 01:33:48,949
It looks like you're over your
fear of helicopters now, huh?!

1367
01:33:55,324 --> 01:33:58,507
Let me off this thing!

1368
01:33:58,531 --> 01:34:00,507
Here you go!

1369
01:34:00,531 --> 01:34:04,217
He suddenly jumped at me,
so I got surprised!

1370
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:08,507
Honestly! It's just a good thing
you only grazed Ran-san's leg.

1371
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:11,508
Anywhere else and things
could've ended badly.

1372
01:34:11,532 --> 01:34:13,507
I'm sorry!

1373
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:18,175
Can't really tell him that my old man
often taught me how to shoot

1374
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:22,967
at the shooting range when
we visited the lodge in Hawaii!

1375
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:27,366
But... I did cause Ran pain...

1376
01:34:28,949 --> 01:34:32,925
Inspector! This is the perfect opportunity
to take some time off!

1377
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:35,384
Yeah, I think I will!

1378
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:37,508
The hat can stay on, if you don't mind.

1379
01:34:37,532 --> 01:34:41,883
Say, do you think even Shinichi
would've shot like you did?

1380
01:34:41,907 --> 01:34:46,384
Who knows. He might've,
if he was as good a shot as me.

1381
01:34:46,408 --> 01:34:49,508
I think so, too. Right, Shinichi?

1382
01:34:49,532 --> 01:34:51,050
What's that?

1383
01:34:51,074 --> 01:34:54,009
Shinichi's card. The Ace of Spades.

1384
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:57,507
I was holding onto it the whole time.

1385
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:01,342
Who knows, maybe Shinichi
helped protect me!

1386
01:35:01,366 --> 01:35:04,050
You dummy! The person saved by the ace...

1387
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:05,991
"An 'A' is in your future"

1388
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:09,657
...was me...

1389
01:35:10,532 --> 01:35:11,699
...you know!

1390
01:35:26,866 --> 01:35:38,507
Whenever I wake up from the dream
I regularly have

1391
01:35:38,531 --> 01:35:49,824
I realize my heart is beating fast

1392
01:35:51,741 --> 01:36:03,507
Love does not beat to a regular rhythm

1393
01:36:03,531 --> 01:36:16,033
I wound up falling asleep again
on the comfy sofa

1394
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:30,508
As if I had returned to the nostalgic time
of when I was a little girl,

1395
01:36:30,532 --> 01:36:36,758
you gently caress my hair

1396
01:36:36,782 --> 01:36:43,883
How long I had waited
for those warm hands

1397
01:36:43,907 --> 01:37:01,134
You alone softly wrap me up

1398
01:37:01,158 --> 01:37:12,657
I love you so much, I love you so much

1399
01:37:39,657 --> 01:37:57,217
You alone softly wrap me up

1400
01:37:57,241 --> 01:38:10,800
I love you so much, with a red heart

1401
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:15,531
Lovin' you

1402
01:38:17,074 --> 01:38:22,116
With you

1403
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:32,883
Eh? You knew why Dad shot you?!

1404
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:36,507
Of course I did! We are married, after all.

1405
01:38:36,531 --> 01:38:41,426
Plus it's only natural for a
husband to protect his wife.

1406
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:44,283
Then why did you leave him?

1407
01:38:46,824 --> 01:38:51,633
That very night, he said my cooking
was horrible and didn't eat it.

1408
01:38:51,657 --> 01:38:53,175
Huh?

1409
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:57,675
My leg hurt so much, and I worked
so hard to thank him with food...

1410
01:38:57,699 --> 01:38:59,450
Yet, he...

1411
01:39:00,657 --> 01:39:05,591
You idiot! If this is the best
you can make, get the hell to bed!

1412
01:39:05,615 --> 01:39:08,366
And that's why I moved out.

1413
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:11,507
Just remembering it makes me mad!

1414
01:39:11,531 --> 01:39:13,507
That insensitive old clod!

1415
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:16,717
O-oh, I see...

1416
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:19,842
Looks like they won't be
making up for a while now...

1417
01:39:19,866 --> 01:39:22,699
Come to think of it, Mom's cooking...

1418
01:39:24,531 --> 01:39:26,532
...was horrible...
