1
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:08,133
Three of the Boys' Detective Agency
have spent their summer vacation

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,095
enthralled by a new video game.

3
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:14,015
After talking to a fellow
Teitan Grade School student

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,683
that we bumped into
at a mini-mart,

5
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,978
we ended up going over to his
relative's place to play the game.

6
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:25,235
I sensed something suspicious
about the apartment.

7
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,947
But just then, Toshinari made a grisly
discovery in the apartment next door.

8
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,662
Elsewhere, there was another surprise
between Detectives Satou and Takagi...

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,125
I'm missing my you-know-what.

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,962
Missed?! You don't mean–

11
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:48,298
It's embarrassing, so don't
tell anyone, got it?

12
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:55,807
-M-Miwako is having a baby?
-What happy news!

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,562
A chic and dashing detective show
that holds up under the blazing sun!

14
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,482
Detective Takagi's gonna be a daddy?

15
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,400
A shocking trick that startles
the two of them!

16
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,695
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

17
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,405
his name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:43,080
Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story
(The Truth)

19
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,125
Tokyo Metropolitan Police

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,502
Grumble

21
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,297
Grumble, grumble...

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,675
Grumble, grumble, grumble...

23
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,637
Grumble...

24
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,640
Grumble, grumble, grumble...

25
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,643
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble...

26
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,895
Grumble, grumble...

27
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,147
Grr...

28
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,113
Grr!

29
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,950
I'm back!

30
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,452
GRR!

31
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,997
What's with this ominous
vibe I'm getting?

32
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,918
Well, you see, Chiba...

33
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,757
Okay, found it!

34
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,845
A bento lunch made on August 13th,
and a newspaper from August 13th.

35
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,767
Well, I do buy a newspaper
every day.

36
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,103
Look, even if you're only taking
care of him for a week,

37
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,108
you can't feed a child nothing but snacks,
mini-mart bento boxes and instant ramen.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,237
Shouldn't you give a little more
thought to what he's eating?

39
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,363
You'll stunt his growth.

40
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,702
S-Satou's maternal instincts
are kicking in!

41
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:06,122
And... And I'm the father!

42
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,292
Hey, Takagi.

43
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,462
Did you go to the mini-mart
and confirm his story?

44
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:17,050
Yes. The store's security
camera caught everything.

45
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:23,890
Around 6:00 PM yesterday, August 13th,
Mr. Yasutomi was there shopping.

46
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:29,228
It also showed Toshinari and Noriya
there at the same time.

47
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,188
Ah.

48
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:35,818
Oh, and there was apparently
an accident six months ago

49
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,863
in front of the florist's
next door to the mini-mart.

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,157
-An accident?
-Yes.

51
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,037
Apparently, a woman ran
into the street.

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,873
The driver swerved to avoid her,
but it was too late.

53
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,292
After he hit her,

54
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:55,172
he slammed into the guard rail in the
oncoming lane and lost consciousness.

55
00:04:55,672 --> 00:05:00,677
A bystander called an ambulance,
and that saved the driver's life,

56
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,763
but his car had snagged
the woman's clothes,

57
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,850
and no one noticed her
underneath the car.

58
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,687
They say the delay in treatment
cost her her life.

59
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:15,317
The driver's statement said that it
looked like she ran into the street

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,485
because she was being
chased by someone.

61
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,948
So? What does that have
to do with this murder?

62
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,077
The thing is, the mini-mart cashier
apparently saw the whole thing.

63
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,497
He saw Mr. Yasutomi
running from the scene.

64
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,708
And as for the woman who
was run over, she–

65
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,085
Yes.

66
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,922
It was my sister, Mika,
who died in that accident.

67
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,095
Ever since then, I've made a point of
laying flowers at the scene every day.

68
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,097
O-Oh, is that right?

69
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,060
That flower seems like a bit of a gaudy
choice to set out, though...

70
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,897
My sister loved pink,
so I thought it would be nice

71
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,858
to set out flowers like that
every once in a while.

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,652
Ah, I see.

73
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,862
Say, mister...

74
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,948
Was your sister having
any problems?

75
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,910
For instance...

76
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,537
A stalker or something, maybe?

77
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,165
-Was there one?
-No.

78
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:17,087
She never mentioned anything
about that to me.

79
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:21,800
I knew it. The man who
killed Mr. Yasutomi...

80
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,802
...was this man.
Toshinari Shiga.

81
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:28,055
But he has an alibi.

82
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:33,937
For the two hours between 7:00 and 9:00
on August 13th, the time of the murder,

83
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,607
he was with Noriya
the entire time.

84
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,945
I'm going to let some
fresh air in.

85
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,323
No way! The sun is going down already!
I have to get home!

86
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:49,285
Seriously? I just opened
this big of chips!

87
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,830
Genta, you're getting
them everywhere!

88
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:53,330
Do you have a bowl
or something?

89
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,750
I think he has paper ones.

90
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,503
What happened to your leg?

91
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:02,173
It looks like bruises
from pinching.

92
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,635
I guess I was bitten by mosquitoes
and scratched too hard.

93
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,767
Hey, about that Yaiba movie
you watched last night, was it...

94
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,398
Yeah, that's right. I held it in so long
I thought I was going to burst.

95
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,777
That means that
that newspaper is...

96
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,072
It can't be.

97
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,157
Conan?

98
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,495
Just as I thought!

99
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,415
The only one missing
is from August 12th.

100
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,542
No doubt about it...

101
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,170
This man is the killer.

102
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:45,717
He manipulated the passage
of time to give himself an alibi.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,763
He even manipulated
Noriya's feelings.

104
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:56,687
At any rate, if Toshinari and Noriya
were next door to the crime scene

105
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,233
from 7:00 to 9:00 PM last night,
the window the murder was committed in,

106
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:07,655
but didn't hear any strange sounds
because of the movie they were watching,

107
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:12,077
our only choice is to question the
other residents of the building.

108
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,748
This building is scheduled to be
demolished next year, though.

109
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,168
The only other residents are an
old couple on the second floor.

110
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,922
They say they spent last night
at their grandchildren's.

111
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,423
Really?

112
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,593
-Haibara, get rid of the others.
-Sure.

113
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:35,225
Come on, everyone. Let's have a sleepover
at the Doctor's place and game all night!

114
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,018
Let's play Titan Hunter, then!

115
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,228
Good idea!

116
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,898
I'll go grab the disc
from my house, then!

117
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:46,862
Care to join us, Noriya? We'll want
to pick your brain over the game.

118
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:51,950
Besides, you don't want to sleep
next to a murder scene, do you?

119
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,582
You're not going?

120
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,625
I will. But first...

121
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:06,630
Why would you move into a building
that's going to be demolished next year?

122
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,550
I wanted to distract myself
with a change of scenery.

123
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:14,805
I used to live with my sister,
and she died in that accident...

124
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:18,142
But you moved in
a month ago, right?

125
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:22,522
You'd think that you would have
bought at least a pot or a skillet.

126
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,108
But there's nothing here at all.

127
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,695
I'm a terrible cook, so I never bothered
to get any cooking utensils.

128
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:34,075
But there isn't any detergent or a
sponge or scrub brush by the sink.

129
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,953
Doesn't that mean that you also
don't have any dishes or glasses?

130
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:40,915
Yes. I'd planned to
get some soon.

131
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,463
Oh, really? I assumed it was because
you planned to move out

132
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:50,383
just as soon as you had murdered
your neighbor, Mr. Yasutomi.

133
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,398
What are you talking about, Conan?

134
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,403
Toshinari was watching TV
during the crime window,

135
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,322
from 7:00 to 9:00 last night.

136
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,115
Noriya was with him.

137
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,408
Didn't you hear Noriya?

138
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,413
He said he held it in as he
watched the whole movie.

139
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:26,920
Doesn't that suggest that there were no
commercials for the whole two hours?

140
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,547
Oh...

141
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,173
Oh, right! A rental DVD!

142
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,675
Rental DVD?

143
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,428
Yes, if it's being aired on TV,

144
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,557
then the movie's also
available for rent now.

145
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,808
It should also be available
for purchase.

146
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:45,897
I follow you. If he bought the DVD
and put it in the player ahead of time,

147
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,067
and then hit Play at exactly
the right time,

148
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,112
it would look to a child
like it was airing on TV.

149
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,198
But Toshinari...

150
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,242
Didn't you say that on the 13th,
the night of the murder,

151
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:03,415
you played that game with Noriya in
addition to watching the movie with him?

152
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,500
Yes. Both before and
after the movie.

153
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,755
He couldn't have
committed it, then.

154
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,175
Was that really the 13th?

155
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,760
Yes,

156
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:21,473
he said he had Noriya check the date on
that paper they bought at the mini-mart.

157
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,267
Isn't that right?

158
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,270
-Yes.
-See?

159
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:29,065
That day was definitely
August 13th.

160
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,193
Oh, I see.
I had it all wrong?

161
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,198
Mini-marts don't sell papers from
a day in the future, now do they?

162
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,367
Tabloids!

163
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,203
Those so-called
"evening edition" papers

164
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,997
have the next day's date
printed on them!

165
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:48,543
If he bought that and had Noriya
check the date for him,

166
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,087
he could make him think
that it was a different day.

167
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:56,677
Now that you mention it, August 12th
was the only day there's no paper for.

168
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:57,843
I get it.

169
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:03,140
He got rid of the paper dated the
13th that he bought on the 12th.

170
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:07,562
In other words, it was actually
the night of August 12th

171
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,813
that you watched that
movie with Noriya,

172
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:15,278
giving you ample opportunity to commit
the murder on the night of the 13th.

173
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,447
N-Now wait just a minute!

174
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:22,452
Didn't you hear Noriya? He said that
we watched the movie yesterday!

175
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:26,707
Even a child can tell the difference
between yesterday and two days ago!

176
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:31,293
If you think I'm lying, call Noriya
back here and ask him!

177
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,338
He knows that today is the day
after we saw that movie!

178
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,758
Actually, Noriya said something
about that, too.

179
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:41,012
On the evening of August 13th,
after you came back from the store,

180
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,723
he played that game
until the movie started.

181
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:47,102
And after it ended, he went back
to playing it until late at night.

182
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,730
He then got up early, and after
playing the game some more,

183
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:54,983
Noriya went to the store with you
to buy breakfast around 6:00 AM.

184
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:58,863
After playing the game again
until lunch, he took a nap.

185
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,157
He then got up and played
the game some more.

186
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:05,703
He was hungry by then, so you two went
to the store earlier and ran into us.

187
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:11,458
And he said he was with me the entire
time he was playing the game, remember?

188
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,713
Yes. But he also said
that you went out for a bit

189
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,383
after you went to the store
and ate breakfast.

190
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,887
You told him to wear headphones
while you were gone.

191
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,057
You went out.
Where?

192
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,643
I-I just stepped out for a smoke.

193
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,603
Besides, that was this morning.

194
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,690
Timing-wise, it has nothing
to do with the murder.

195
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,317
Speaking of time,

196
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,403
there isn't a single clock in this
whole apartment, is there?

197
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:44,408
The only person who knows what time
it is is you, with your watch.

198
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,663
Plus, there are these heavy
curtains on all the windows.

199
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,125
And if you're eating snacks
the whole time you're gaming,

200
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,918
you won't get hungry, either.

201
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,423
That would make it really easy to
lose track of time, now wouldn't it?

202
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,552
I really think you
should buy a clock.

203
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,803
S-Sure...

204
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,682
Oh, I see.
So this is how it went down:

205
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,520
On the 12th, the day before the murder,
you bought an evening edition at the store

206
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,315
and made Noriya think that
it was actually the 13th.

207
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:19,902
That night, you let him play
his game until after 10:00 or so

208
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:21,947
and then told him it was
time for the movie.

209
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:24,782
Then, assuming you let him play until
early morning after having him

210
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,410
watch the movie on DVD
until about midnight,

211
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,247
it was really the afternoon of the 13th

212
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,915
when you woke him up
and said it was morning.

213
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:37,170
You let him play until evening, and
when you said "Let's buy breakfast"

214
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,800
and went to the store, that was
actually 6:00 PM on the 13th.

215
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:48,807
Oh, I get it! The sun is out at both
6:00 AM and 6:00 PM this time of year!

216
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:54,312
And then, when you stepped out
to run an errand after "breakfast,"

217
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:58,650
you had plenty of time
to murder Mr. Yasutomi.

218
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,447
Noriya was wearing headphones then,
so he wouldn't have heard a thing.

219
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,075
Afterwards, you came back
to your apartment

220
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,120
and had Noriya keep playing
until early morning.

221
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:15,750
If you told him to take a nap and let
him sleep until noon today, the 14th,

222
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:23,633
it would have seemed to Noriya that
the 13th and 14th were only one day.

223
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,762
Well? Did I get anything wrong?

224
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:29,263
How do you expect me
to answer that?

225
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,892
What possible motive
would I have?

226
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,062
Your sister sure is pretty!

227
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:37,855
Hey! Kid!

228
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,652
It's strange. She isn't looking into
the camera in any of these at the end.

229
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,655
And there's some kinda
hole at the tops.

230
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,952
You sure must love
your sister!

231
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,247
I bet you had a bunch of pictures
of your sister pinned up somewhere

232
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,082
that you'd taken
without her knowing!

233
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,168
-Are those from–
-The stalker?!

234
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,923
Come to think of it, Forensics
mentioned something about that.

235
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:08,052
There was a cork board in Mr. Yasutomi's
room with lots of photos pinned to it,

236
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:11,055
but they didn't line up with the
sun-bleached areas on the board.

237
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,975
So these are the pictures that
were really pinned up there.

238
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:19,563
After the murder, you took them down
to remove any connection to you,

239
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:23,443
and you replaced them with pictures you
found in Yasutomi's apartment, right?

240
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,488
If that's the case, the camera files
these were made from

241
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,990
might still be on the laptop
that was on Yasutomi's desk.

242
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,703
Check it out right away.
They're probably already deleted, though.

243
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:34,995
On it!

244
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,040
I think they're still there.

245
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,462
I didn't think that far ahead.

246
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,548
Anyway, the only reason
I took her pictures down

247
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:53,473
was because I didn't want them hanging
in that stalker bastard's apartment.

248
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:58,143
Then Mr. Yasutomi really
was stalking your sister?

249
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:02,732
Yes. I found out
two months ago.

250
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,945
I was placing flowers at the spot
she died like I always do,

251
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,407
and he came up to me.

252
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,242
He asked me
if I was also a "fan."

253
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:21,125
I was curious, so I followed him. That's
when I saw it through the window.

254
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:26,172
Dozens of her pictures
were pinned up,

255
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:30,635
and he was muttering that it was
her fault for running away.

256
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:34,847
Hang on, that report that it
looked like she was being chased

257
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,017
when she ran into
the street, that was...

258
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:42,188
Yes. She ran into the street
when she was being chased by him

259
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,398
and she was hit by that car.

260
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:50,155
I know because I got him
to confess before I killed him.

261
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,617
"Why did you run away," I asked!

262
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:58,078
"Why didn't you tell the EMTs
that my sister was under the car?!"

263
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:05,003
If he'd said something,
she might still be alive!

264
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:09,715
He said... He said it was
because he was scared!

265
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:16,263
And so you moved next to Mr. Yasutomi
and put your plan into motion?

266
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:22,770
Yes, I was asked a while ago
to look after Noriya for a week.

267
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:28,443
I never expected that I would be able
to fool him so easily, though.

268
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:30,487
What are you talking about?

269
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:34,823
It "worked" because Noriya
pinched his own leg

270
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,993
to stay awake and play
that game for so long.

271
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:43,917
Because he'd been asked by his mother
to stay with you and cheer you up.

272
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,755
This crazy plan of yours never
would have worked otherwise.

273
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,633
Now I get it...

274
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:57,347
He was the one
who was looking after me.

275
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,307
So, what's going to
happen with Noriya?

276
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:27,645
Until his mother comes back, he's going
to stay at Dr. Agasa's house.

277
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,273
Apparently, his mother
called him and told him

278
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,818
that Toshinari had to go
on a trip for a while.

279
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:35,153
Oh?

280
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,947
So, are you ever going
to tell me? Who were you going to
give those flowers to?

281
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,703
To you, obviously!

282
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,330
It was going to be a surprise!

283
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,792
I was going to give you the false
dragonheads along with the ring!

284
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:52,712
Flowers and a ring?

285
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:57,008
Instead of all that, give me
your red lapel pin instead.

286
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,052
Red pin?

287
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:02,805
The ones given out to members of
Criminal Investigations Division?

288
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,058
Why would you want mine?

289
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:07,977
You said you were going to
do right by me, didn't you?

290
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:13,065
For the love of... I tackled
that suspect you had cuffed

291
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,527
when he almost got away
from you, remember?

292
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:20,490
The impact must have
knocked my pin off.

293
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:26,078
I noticed it was missing afterwards and
went back and searched everywhere,

294
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,913
but I couldn't find it!

295
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:31,710
Oh, I picked that up and put it
in my left pants pocket.

296
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,337
-Sorry, I should have told you!
-No way!

297
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,672
Seriously?!

298
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,965
-Hey! Satou!
-Got it!

299
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,885
My red pin!
What a relief!

300
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:45,640
Everyone wears them, but it's
not like it's mandatory.

301
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:49,560
If you'd gone to the bosses, I'm sure
they would have given you a new one.

302
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,562
Oh, really?

303
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:55,233
I assumed I'd have to file an apology,
so I was too embarrassed to bring it up.

304
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,362
Boy, I've been a moody
wreck ever since!

305
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:03,492
Uh... When you said you were missing
something earlier, you meant–

306
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,368
Yep! This red pin!

307
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:09,997
Look out! Watch it!

308
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,543
Hey, what are you
moping about?

309
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,468
We nabbed the culprit in no time flat,
so let's see some spring in your step!

310
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,553
Yeah...

311
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:28,850
Is it just me, or is everybody...

312
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,518
They're looking at us,
aren't they?

313
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,187
Miwako!

314
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:35,690
Yumi? And Chiba?

315
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,818
Hey, Yumi...
Everybody's staring at us.

316
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,322
You know better than anyone.

317
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,325
Miwako, I hear you missed
a little something?

318
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,160
Oh, that!
Don't worry, I found it!

319
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:50,413
-Found it?
-Found it?

320
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:54,125
Look, Takagi said he
found it for me.

321
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,380
If he'd told me earlier, I wouldn't have
been in the dumps this whole time.

322
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,173
D-Do they think that she's...

323
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,427
Huh? Think what?

324
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:08,013
Time, 2126 hours! Wataru Susumu
taken into custody!

325
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,642
-Now taking him to interrogation room!
-Roger that!

326
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,355
Hey!

327
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,068
Takagi did something stupid
again, didn't he?

328
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,863
I'm sorry!
There's been a mistake!

329
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:28,158
It's a little misunderstanding!
Er, I was the one who got it wrong!
