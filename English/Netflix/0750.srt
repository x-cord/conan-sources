1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,093
Wow!

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,178
Look at all the yachts!

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,973
How far can ships
like those go?

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:18,770
To a whole other country!
All the oceans are connected!

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,897
I wish I could go aboard one.

6
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,357
I know what you mean.

7
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,358
That's nice and all,

8
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:29,030
but I'm hungry, so let's head back
and eat our bento lunches.

9
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,910
Genta, you're all appetite for food
and no appetite for adventure.

10
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:44,378
Whoa, that looks awesome!

11
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,883
Um, where are you going?

12
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:53,722
This must be it...
Mr. Takiguchi!

13
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:58,435
Shirakabe Hotel delivery, sir.
I've brought the food you ordered.

14
00:00:58,518 --> 00:00:59,768
He said he's from a hotel!

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,647
No wonder it looks
so delicious!

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,942
Hey. Stare all you want,
but you're not getting any.

17
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,193
Beat it.

18
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:10,280
There's no call to be so mean.

19
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,492
Thank you for coming.
That was fast.

20
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,160
Nao Takiguchi (34)
Company President's Wife

21
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:18,580
What a cute doggie!

22
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,707
His name is Koro. And that's such a pretty necklace!

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,255
Thank you, but this is just
a cheap acrylic piece.

24
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,425
Ma'am, where would you
like the food?

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,762
Oh, I'm sorry. Could I trouble you
to bring it aboard?

26
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,765
You children come, too.

27
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,098
But...

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,268
You don't even know us, we couldn't...

29
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:44,397
This hotel's food is delicious.
You want some, don't you?

30
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,902
But if we eat, there won't
be enough left for you.

31
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,570
Kids shouldn't stand
on formalities.

32
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,155
Kotarou Takiguchi (55)
Company President

33
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,450
We ordered more than we could eat and
planned to have the leftovers tonight.

34
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:58,995
We can really eat it, then?

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,623
Yes. I was just thinking that it would
be lonely to eat by ourselves.

36
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,833
You're more than welcome
to join us.

37
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,170
In that case...

38
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,047
We accept!

39
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,597
A chic and dashing detective show
that holds up under the blazing sun!

40
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,892
We're all witnesses!
A millionaire dives into the sea!

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,353
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,190
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:59,032
The Man Who Was Betrayed
by the Sea

44
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,827
Where the heck did
those three go?

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,205
It's your own fault for coming to the
beach and doing nothing but sleep.

46
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:09,500
If we don't find them soon,

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,962
we're gonna eat those
bentos without them.

48
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,297
If we do that,
they'll never forgive us.

49
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,925
Hell hath no fury like
a stomach scorned.

50
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,343
Good point.

51
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,930
Conan and Haibara are
gonna be so sorry

52
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,933
that they missed out on
such delicious food!

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,437
Don't worry about them!

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,605
It's his own fault for sleeping after
coming all the way to the beach!

55
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,858
More friends of yours
are here?

56
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,278
We're really good friends!

57
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,698
But Haibara said that she didn't
want to get a sunburn!

58
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,825
Oh?

59
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:45,495
If a grade-schooler is
worried about her skin,

60
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,790
I can't wait to see what sort
of beauty she grows into.

61
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:53,587
Conan is in grade school, but spends
all his time reading mystery novels.

62
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,963
He doesn't really
act like a kid!

63
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,715
He's such a nerd.

64
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,800
Gosh, I'm ever so sorry
for being a nerd.

65
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:01,510
Conan!

66
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,930
Then this cutie is Miss Haibara?

67
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:08,810
Yes. You'll have to excuse me for not
being a full-grown beauty yet, though.

68
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:14,690
You're plenty beautiful already.
For a grade-schooler, of course.

69
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,570
What are you guys doing here?

70
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,738
We could ask the same thing.

71
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:24,367
We were out looking for you so we
could finally eat our bento lunches.

72
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:27,787
I don't mean to disparage what
your mothers made for you,

73
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,665
but surely you can eat them
on the way home, can't you?

74
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,585
Please, join us for lunch.

75
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:37,130
Yeah, do it! This roast beef
is great!

76
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,465
This spiny lobster is the best!

77
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,508
Yeah!

78
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,057
Mitsuhiko! Don't hog that lobster!

79
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,017
This is a spiny lobster!

80
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,812
That's not the same thing?

81
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,563
Darling.

82
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,273
The children will laugh at you.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,902
You're like a couple of newlyweds!

84
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:03,865
Well, we just got married
six months ago.

85
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,202
And this is my first marriage.

86
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,663
I spent so much time on my company

87
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,750
that I forgot to get
married until late in life.

88
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,215
I'm jealous!

89
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,720
It'd be so great to go out to sea on a
ship like this and swim in the ocean!

90
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:30,600
Forget about it! You're not a very
good swimmer yet, remember?

91
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,937
If I lived on a ship like this,
I'd learn to swim in no time!

92
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,940
That's the spirit, Ayumi!
Never let things get you down!

93
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:42,945
I couldn't swim either, and I'm 53!
But I practiced hard, and now I can!

94
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,990
People can do anything
if they set their minds to it!

95
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,702
You joined a health club,
didn't you?

96
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:52,497
No, we just had a new house built,
so we had a pool put in.

97
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,583
Let me show you
something amazing!

98
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,130
You made a video of that?

99
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,342
Cut it out, it's embarrassing!

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,970
But by the end, look!

101
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,183
You're right!

102
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,560
You're really swimming!

103
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:19,940
Sweet! Then let's race to see who
can reach that embankment first!

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,152
You can use a swim ring, Ayumi!

105
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,697
-Okay, you're on!
-No!

106
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,450
You just drank some wine.

107
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,662
And your blood pressure is high
as it is. You should rest first.

108
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,165
Dang, I was sure that
I had it in the bag!

109
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,880
How old is Koro?

110
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,508
He just turned 1.

111
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,762
Hm? The buckle on
his collar is rusted.

112
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,307
Oh, maybe that's because we go for
walkies even when it's raining.

113
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,270
Hey, we should head back.

114
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,688
Oops, I forgot.

115
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,902
Running off and stuffing your
faces without telling me...

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,530
Someone should have
come back and told me.

117
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,575
I was so worried that I was
this close to calling the police.

118
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,953
It's bad for your digestion
if you eat while angry.

119
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,498
Yahoo!

120
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,710
Here it comes!

121
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,212
Nice shot!

122
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,215
Catch!

123
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,258
Huh?

124
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:32,472
Isn't that the Takiguchis' ship
that's heading out?

125
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,558
You're right!

126
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,685
Yeah! Nao just came out
on deck, too!

127
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,022
Is he planning to
do some swimming?

128
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,982
Hey, Pops! Thanks for
the grub earlier!

129
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,532
Let's swim, too!

130
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:51,573
Good idea!

131
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:55,495
-I'll go get my swim ring!
-What's going on?! This isn't right!

132
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,498
S-Somebody! Somebody, help!

133
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh, no! He's drowning!

134
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,043
Darling!

135
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,272
Tokyo Fire Department

136
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,148
I'm really worried...

137
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,193
I don't really feel like
playing anymore, you know?

138
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:28,027
Yeah...

139
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,988
There's plenty of daylight left,
but I think we should head home.

140
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,867
We can call the fire department later
to check in on Mr. Takiguchi.

141
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:44,627
You're the children who were with
the Takiguchis earlier, aren't you?

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,213
When I got to their boat to pick up
our dishes, no one was there.

143
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,050
Do you know
what's going on?

144
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,928
Oh, we'll get your dishes
for you, then.

145
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:04,438
Oh, right... They didn't let you
ride in the ambulance, did they?

146
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:11,445
We should bring them
their clothes, shouldn't we?

147
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,698
Oh, I guess we should.

148
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,997
You're certain it was
an accident?

149
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:21,790
Emergency Care Center

150
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,625
Our investigation has only
just gotten underway,

151
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,838
but from eyewitness accounts, it seems
clear that he dove in voluntarily.

152
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,923
Ryouichi Katagiri (48)
Takiguchi's Assistant

153
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,843
I can't believe that. Isn't it possible
that someone pushed him in?

154
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,222
He and his wife were the only
two people on the ship.

155
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,180
Det. Nagai (38)

156
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,392
Are you implying that
she shoved him in?

157
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:45,480
Of course not, but Mr. Takiguchi
told me a story once.

158
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,273
He almost drowned
in a river as a child,

159
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,443
and has been too afraid of the water
ever since to learn to swim!

160
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,988
He practiced really hard recently
and learned how.

161
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,242
Who are you?

162
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,870
Oh, pardon the interruption.

163
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:05,208
These children made friends with
the Takiguchis at the beach.

164
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:09,170
They were very kind to the children, so
they wanted to come see how he's doing.

165
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,963
We brought them their clothes!

166
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,592
And Koro was left behind.

167
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,262
What's Mr. Takiguchi's condition?

168
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,100
I'm not sure how to
break this to you,

169
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,602
but he was pronounced dead
a few minutes ago.

170
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,358
But that's... How could
someone so nice die?

171
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,445
I can't believe it...

172
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:40,618
Anyway, Detective, please find out
for sure if this really was an accident!

173
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:44,580
I warned him again and again
before they got married

174
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,582
that she was only after
his money!

175
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,710
He was completely taken in
by that woman,

176
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,505
and now look what's happened!

177
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,798
Are you saying
that Nao did this?!

178
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,927
A nice lady like her
could never do something bad!

179
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,138
Now, now...

180
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:04,933
You'll have to forgive them. Are you
with Mr. Takiguchi's company?

181
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:08,522
Yes, I'm Katagiri,
his executive assistant.

182
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,607
Did you see the accident?

183
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,150
We sure did!

184
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,862
Mr. Takiguchi drowned
right in front of us!

185
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,242
He waved to us and then
dove into the water!

186
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:26,163
I see... I know it's a lot, but can
you come down to the station

187
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,290
and tell me exactly
what you saw?

188
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,043
-Sure!
-Yes, sir.

189
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,012
When Mr. Takiguchi dove in,

190
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,765
do you know where
Mrs. Takiguchi was?

191
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,185
She was standing a little
bit away, doing something.

192
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,772
I think she might have been
cleaning up the lunch dishes.

193
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:55,318
I see. Maybe that explains why she
was slow to notice him drowning.

194
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,695
Come in.

195
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,077
Nao!

196
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,415
Ayumi... Thank you
for bringing my clothes.

197
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,795
Nao? Where's your necklace?

198
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,882
I guess the chain broke

199
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:20,260
when I was trying to save my husband
and it sank to the bottom.

200
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,140
I've gotten statements
from these children,

201
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:29,352
and it seems clear that your husband
dove into the water voluntarily.

202
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:33,398
I think it's safe to write this off
as an unfortunate accident.

203
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:35,942
It was all my fault.

204
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,362
Even if he said he could
swim just fine,

205
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,280
if I'd been paying closer
attention, maybe he...

206
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:45,618
The last question I had for you
has to do with that.

207
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:49,663
An employee at the company said that
Mr. Takiguchi told him he couldn't swim.

208
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,333
Had he really learned how? You should show it to him!
You know, that video of him practicing!

209
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,342
Oh, right.

210
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:04,845
This was recorded during his first
lesson in the pool at home.

211
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:09,058
I had our housekeeper film it.

212
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,310
You're doing it!

213
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:15,732
And this one was recorded
last week.

214
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:23,155
That's the way! Keep it up!
Now turn without stopping!

215
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,412
I see... He had definitely
learned how to swim.

216
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,082
Come with me for a minute.

217
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,585
What is it, Conan?

218
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,630
Can I see your video camera?

219
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,715
Sure, I guess.

220
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:52,060
Is something important
recorded on there?

221
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,645
You're right!

222
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,855
Yeah! Nao just came out
on deck, too!

223
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,317
Good, there's audio, too.

224
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,320
The important part is coming up.

225
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,657
Let's swim, too!

226
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:06,615
Good idea!

227
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:10,745
-I'll go get my swim ring!
-What's going on?! This isn't right!

228
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,790
S-Somebody! Somebody, help!

229
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,835
This is it.

230
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,545
This can zoom in, right?

231
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,840
Yeah, the image will
be degraded, though.

232
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:26,343
S-Somebody! Somebody, help!

233
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:36,520
Darling!

234
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,567
What's going on?

235
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,945
There's a pause between when Nao
notices that Kotarou is drowning

236
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,530
and when she dives in
to help him.

237
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:51,703
And their cabin cruiser
had a life preserver.

238
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,913
Why didn't she use it?

239
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:59,668
And what about that thing I noticed
in those swim practice videos?

240
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,340
Was Kotarou really...

241
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,135
What are you two
whispering about out here?

242
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,678
Oh, um...

243
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:14,683
Hm? The buckle on
his collar is rusted.

244
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:18,563
Oh, maybe that's because we go for
walkies even when it's raining.

245
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,232
That's it!

246
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:30,867
I'm sorry to have put you to all this
trouble, everyone, but you can go now.

247
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,703
I'll take you back to
the hospital, Ma'am.

248
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,747
Thank you for your assistance.

249
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:38,207
Could I trouble you
to put that off for a bit?

250
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,210
Is there a something that
you would like to add?

251
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,797
Oh, no, um...

252
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:48,760
This was no accident. It was
premeditated murder.

253
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,220
It was what?!

254
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,058
But Mr. Takiguchi dove
into the water himself!

255
00:16:56,183 --> 00:17:00,563
Yes, but if he'd known
that he couldn't swim,

256
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:04,150
he wouldn't have dove in,
would he?

257
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:08,572
Mr. Takiguchi was made to
believe that he could swim

258
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:13,325
and then brought out in their cabin
cruiser to water too deep to stand in.

259
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,287
Wouldn't you call that murder?

260
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,167
Isn't that right, Nao Takiguchi?

261
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,793
My husband was fully
capable of swimming.

262
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:25,005
You saw it with
your own two eyes.

263
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,800
Or has that video been
doctored in some way?

264
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:34,805
No, that video was genuine.
Mr. Takiguchi could swim.

265
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,975
What are you trying to say?

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,560
He could swim,

267
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:41,270
but only in his own pool.

268
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,313
-Conan?
-Coming!

269
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,442
Can I borrow this?

270
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:51,155
Look at Nao's necklace in the video
where he was practicing his kicks.

271
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,533
See? It's hanging down
in the water.

272
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,995
But on the last day...

273
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,372
See? Now it's floating.

274
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,665
L-Let me see that!

275
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:08,507
I-It's hanging down in one and
floating in the other, all right!

276
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,885
Can you explain this
in layman's terms?

277
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,808
It was Koro who told me why it is
that her necklace is floating.

278
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,188
The buckle of Koro's collar,
which should only be one year old,

279
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,942
is covered in rust
for some reason.

280
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:31,237
You poured a huge amount of bath salts
into the pool, Mrs. Takiguchi.

281
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,657
To make his body
more buoyant.

282
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,868
The necklace in the video
is acrylic.

283
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:42,748
The specific gravity of acrylic
ranges from 1.17 to 1.2,

284
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:48,170
so the specific gravity of the pool water
last week was greater than that.

285
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,507
Isn't that right, Mrs. Takiguchi?

286
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,968
You're wrong, If I had
put in that much bath salt,

287
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,638
even a dimwit like my husband
would have noticed.

288
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,723
What did you put
in there, then?

289
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,812
The necklace that sank into the sea
is floating in that video.

290
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,273
In any event, we've established
that the pool water in the video

291
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,735
has a high specific gravity.

292
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,488
Shall we go to your house
and examine it?

293
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:19,368
Feel free, but there isn't any water.
I drained the pool.

294
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,038
I wouldn't underestimate
the police.

295
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,582
If there is anything at all
left in the pool,

296
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:28,293
they'll quickly find out exactly
what was dissolved in the water.

297
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:32,965
Ma'am, is what this man
saying true?

298
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,218
Answer me!

299
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,472
Nao! It's not true, is it?!

300
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,935
It's true.

301
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:50,317
As this man said, I poured in
bath salt at first,

302
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:54,737
but when I increased the amount,
my husband noticed.

303
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:58,617
After that, I switched to
a water-soluble polymer.

304
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:01,912
A harmless kind used in
medicines and food.

305
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:08,627
The specific gravity of the water last
week must have gone above 1.3.

306
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,172
1.3 is the same as that
of the Dead Sea,

307
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:15,342
where you're supposedly able to
read a book while floating.

308
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,472
It's no surprise that Mr. Takiguchi
mistakenly believed that he could swim.

309
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,355
You probably made that video for when
you were questioned by the police,

310
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,733
but the footage in it
backfired on you.

311
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,492
The only thing he ever thought of
was expanding his company.

312
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:46,038
He would use any dirty tactic
without a second thought.

313
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,335
Without caring how many people
he made suffer as a result.

314
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:54,588
So I planned to make him
suffer this time.

315
00:20:55,507 --> 00:21:01,595
Being with that man with no common sense
or education was a living hell.

316
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:06,475
I couldn't take it anymore.

317
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:10,855
Mr. Takiguchi was obsessed
with making money, all right,

318
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:14,442
and perhaps he was lacking in
common sense and education,

319
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,778
but wouldn't you say that he had far
more humanity in him than you,

320
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:21,282
a woman who would commit
murder to get her revenge?

321
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:53,165
I trusted her because
she was so nice.

322
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:57,462
When she invited us to eat with them,
I thought she was a good person.

323
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:00,215
I'm never trusting adults again!

324
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:03,885
There are all sorts of adults.
All shapes and sizes.

325
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,053
That's true.

326
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:08,055
I myself still have a pure heart
after all these years!

327
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,808
Was that laugh because of
how purehearted I am?

328
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,060
Hey, don't we still have
those bento boxes left?

329
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:17,648
Oh, right! We were treated to lunch,
so we still have our bento boxes!

330
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,192
Let's go eat 'em!

331
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:22,112
Now that you mention it,
I'm starving!

332
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,072
I wonder what's in them!
