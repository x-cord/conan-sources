1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:04,759
Wow, that's awesome!
There's really a writeup on Poirot!

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:06,138
I know, right?

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:10,480
The interviewer came over earlier and
said they were doing an article on us,

4
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:14,571
but I didn't think they were going to
make us out to be such a big deal.

5
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,826
And there's a picture
of you, Azusa!

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,753
Look, right here! "Captain, a calico
who is a regular customer,

7
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,881
as well as Azusa,
their lovely barista."

8
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,013
Hey. you're right!
She's holding Captain!

9
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:30,270
Gosh, calling me a lovely barista
is a bit much, huh?

10
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,776
Puff pieces like this are always
a little over the top.

11
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,406
I-I guess so...

12
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:39,371
You're not in the article, Amuro?

13
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:43,838
No, I wasn't feeling well
that day, so I called in sick.

14
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,426
What lousy timing!

15
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,180
You're so good looking!

16
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:51,478
Members of the Organization
can't exactly go around

17
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:54,401
showing their faces
in lighthearted foodie mags.

18
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:59,077
Say, wasn't there one more
in your little group?

19
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,872
Ai went home early.

20
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:05,298
We invited her to come with us
to Poirot to see Captain...

21
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,802
But she said she remembered
something she had to do.

22
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:10,975
S-Speaking of Captain,
where is he?

23
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:12,895
Has he already
turned up to be fed?

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,024
Actually, the thing is,

25
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:20,995
Captain's officially been
my house cat since last week!

26
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,752
Can you do that?

27
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,799
Captain might be a stray,

28
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:30,515
but he was wearing a collar,
so he used to belong to someone!

29
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:35,317
But he turned up covered
in scratches a while ago,

30
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:39,282
like he had gotten into a fight with a
local cat, so I was worried about him.

31
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,205
Besides, there's a picture of him
in the magazine.

32
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,917
If he has an owner who's
really looking for him,

33
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:48,341
I figure he'll find the article
and come forward to claim him.

34
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:52,309
Aw, but it's no fair, you hogging
Captain for yourself!

35
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:57,652
And a little picture like that
isn't gonna turn up his owner!

36
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,200
It would be a different story
if it were on the internet.

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,454
You'd think so, right?

38
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,873
But guess what?

39
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,793
Excuse me.

40
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,966
Is this the "Poirot" joint
that was in that magazine?

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,387
Yes, that's right.

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,057
Part of the article
caught my attention.

43
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,858
It said there's a cat that
shows up every evening to be fed.

44
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,151
There was a picture.

45
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:18,986
Yes.

46
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,365
Shugo Amesawa (36)
Job Hopper

47
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:24,914
The thing is, that's my cat! I've been
looking for him for six months!

48
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:29,090
Hey! What are you talking about?

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,846
That's my pet cat,
no two ways about it!

50
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:32,514
Teishi Masuko (54)

51
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:34,392
Don't talk nonsense!

52
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:39,694
Oh, wow! His owner
really turned up!

53
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,991
And two of them!

54
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,746
It's not just two!

55
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:48,002
There's actually one more
inside the shop right now.

56
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,224
A chic, stylish detective show
that's like an autumn breeze

57
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,977
blowing away the lingering summer heat!

58
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,484
Three owners have come forward?
It's a Kogorou/Bourbon sleuth tag team!

59
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:02,782
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

60
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,330
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:37,347
The Case of the Lucky Calico
(Part 1)

62
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,145
Don't make me repeat myself!

63
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,527
This is my granddaughter's
pet cat, Mugi!

64
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,655
Mutsumi Shagawa (61)
Housewife

65
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:50,498
Where is Mugi? I thought you
were going to bring him!

66
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,839
Yes, we left to do just that,

67
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,595
but we ran into these kids,
and as we were talking,

68
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:01,811
these gentlemen came up and claimed
that they were the real owners.

69
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,817
No, I am the real owner.

70
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,865
Like hell you are!
I'm his owner!

71
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,789
Are you two trying to steal
my granddaughter's cat?

72
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,421
Wow, Captain's so popular!

73
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,298
But why three people?

74
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,681
He's a perfectly ordinary,
run-of-the-mill calico cat.

75
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,103
No, he's anything but ordinary.

76
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,486
Sure, I think that
he's a great cat.

77
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:30,620
When you were locked in
that crook's delivery truck,

78
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:34,419
he brought your message
here to us!

79
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,550
We couldn't have solved
that case without him!

80
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:42,309
He delivered it, but it got
blown away by the wind.

81
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,188
Yes.

82
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:48,405
Anyway, go back to your place
and fetch Captain, Azusa.

83
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:50,074
Will do!

84
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:55,251
And while we're waiting, let's
question these three separately.

85
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,425
With the help of a
mystery-solving specialist.

86
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,514
Mystery-solving specialist?

87
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,186
He can't possibly mean...

88
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:07,444
Come again?
Identify the owner of a cat?

89
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,611
<i>And they're off!</i>

90
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:11,493
Ask somebody else to do it!
I'm busy!

91
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:12,954
Sheesh...

92
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,585
It's Goro!

93
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,003
What's she doing here?

94
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,134
She belongs to that scary
old lady, doesn't she?

95
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,390
"Scary old lady," he says...

96
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:25,938
Mom had to go to Fukuoka for work,

97
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,945
so she asked me to
cat-sit her tonight.

98
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:34,914
Go on, scram! It ain't like I'd be
paid for my time, right?

99
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,336
I'll hire you, then.

100
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:42,680
Your payment will be a premium seat
at Youko Okino's summer concert.

101
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:48,065
Very well, you are our
first owner candidate.

102
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,030
You are Mrs. Shagawa,
a housewife?

103
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,073
Yes.

104
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:54,579
This old fart is so simple-minded.

105
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,960
So, when did your cat
go missing?

106
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,381
About two months ago.

107
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:04,223
I was about to go on a trip with
my family, so I left him with a friend.

108
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:08,022
But she says he vanished when she
took her eyes off him for a second.

109
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:12,824
This is a photo of my granddaughter,
the cat's owner.

110
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,369
It was taken five years ago.

111
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,292
Ah, I see. He's still
a kitten here,

112
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:22,594
but his spot pattern
is certainly similar.

113
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:25,431
Isn't it? You think so,
too, Detective?

114
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:26,851
Yes.

115
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,482
Does that mean that you
also like cats, Ma'am?

116
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,528
Yes, of course!

117
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:34,408
Come! Come on!

118
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:35,828
Come to me!

119
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,631
Goodness, what a shy cat.

120
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,053
She seems to be quite
fond of you.

121
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:46,265
She's not my cat.

122
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:51,067
The shop's calico cat has scars
from desexing surgery.

123
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,323
What a nightmare that was.

124
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:57,078
We got him back after an
overnight stay at the vet's,

125
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,208
but his bandages
had to stay on.

126
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,550
It was because his stitches didn't
come out until about a week later.

127
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:07,224
Mr. Masuko, IT industry
company president.

128
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,608
You are our second
owner candidate.

129
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,736
When did your cat go missing?

130
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,620
It happened when I moved
four months ago.

131
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:21,753
My wife of thirty years
had passed away,

132
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:25,637
so I was selling my house
and moving into a condo.

133
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:30,102
I could swear I had put him into his
cage and put it in the moving truck.

134
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,109
But when I got out,
the cage was missing.

135
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,407
Do you have a picture?

136
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,996
I have a cell phone photo.

137
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:43,713
It's my wife in the picture with him.
I'm the one who took it.

138
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,430
My goodness, he's the spitting image
of Poirot's cat, isn't he?

139
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:51,938
Of course he is!
He's the same cat.

140
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:54,026
Then do you also like cats, Mister?

141
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,614
-Sure.
-Want to hold her?

142
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:00,873
Do you have a cold?

143
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,711
Maybe I do...

144
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,261
Incidentally, did you
have your cat desexed?

145
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:12,814
Yes, but my wife handled all that,
so I don't know the details.

146
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,738
I just remember that he didn't have
any bandages after the surgery,

147
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:21,664
just some satellite dish-looking
thing around his neck.

148
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:27,677
Like I've been telling you,
just let me hold the cat!

149
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,972
You'll see that I'm his owner!

150
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:34,481
Please tell me all about the cat,
Mr. Amesawa, job hopper.

151
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,028
When did the cat go missing?

152
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,823
About six months ago.

153
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:42,832
I like my freedom, so I also
let my cat run free.

154
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,088
One day, he suddenly
stopped coming home.

155
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,009
Do you have a picture
or something?

156
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:52,016
Of course I don't have a picture!
I let him run free!

157
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,731
Then you like cats, Mister?

158
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:56,317
Sure, of course I do.

159
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,157
Come to papa!

160
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:06,253
No way! Goro is usually
skittish around strangers!

161
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:09,886
What can I say?
Animals like me!

162
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,434
Then do you remember if you
had the cat desexed?

163
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:18,444
Nah. He was already
pretty big when I got him.

164
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:24,832
By the way, "Captain" sounds masculine,
but it's actually a she.

165
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,840
Th-Then maybe it's not mine.

166
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,971
-What're you talking about?
-Captain's a boy!

167
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:35,269
-He has you-know-whats!
-Oh, really?

168
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,528
H-Hey, don't yank my chain like that!
Of course he's a boy!

169
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:48,212
Out of those three, who do you
think the real owner is?

170
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,341
Don't you think it's
that younger guy?

171
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,805
Goro was all over him!

172
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:57,356
But the cat in the picture on the older
guy's phone looked just like Captain!

173
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,697
But he himself wasn't
in the picture.

174
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:04,536
What about the photo that
the old woman showed us?

175
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:08,127
But the cat in that photo
was just a kitten.

176
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:11,258
Did anything jump out at you, Conan?

177
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,344
No, not yet.

178
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,224
C'mon, attaboy!

179
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,355
Hey, turn down that down!
We can't work with all that noise!

180
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,109
Noise?

181
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,741
Oh, I know!
I'll tell Ai!

182
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,750
Three owners came forward?

183
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,879
How's it look, then?

184
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:34,011
Everyone is tearing their hair out.
They can't figure out who the owner is.

185
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:36,433
Not everyone.
Just Edogawa.

186
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:38,645
What kind of face
is he making?

187
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:45,284
He just broke out in an evil grin.
Like some prankster kid!

188
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,832
You're fine, then.

189
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,713
He must have figured out
who the owner is.

190
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,731
Hey, what's the deal, man?

191
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:04,156
Didn't you bring us back here because
you figured out who the owner is?

192
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:10,126
Relax, Azusa from Poirot will be here
with the calico any time now.

193
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:13,507
Oh. Then you should
have said so.

194
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,638
When the cat sees its owner,
we'll have our answer.

195
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:20,940
But in my case, it's my granddaughter
who's the owner.

196
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,319
Thanks for waiting!

197
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,696
Captain!

198
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,255
See, what did I tell you?
This is obviously my cat!

199
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:37,221
I'll be taking my cat home, then!

200
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,901
But when cats see three people,
they're drawn to the one in the middle,

201
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:48,327
so it might have jumped on you because
that's where you happened to be.

202
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:51,208
-What?
-Is that true, Conan?

203
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,796
I saw it in a show
on TV a while ago!

204
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,885
That must be why!

205
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:58,806
My cat would never have jumped on
a shady character like you otherwise!

206
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:04,193
Do it again, then! Put me on the
left or right, it'll be the same!

207
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:07,533
There's a much faster way
to find out.

208
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,746
I have an experiment that will tell us
right away who the owner is.

209
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,710
Azusa, are you ready?

210
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,930
Yes, Captain is munching away on
his food in front of the office door!

211
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:23,105
Now, go up to the door
and open it one at a time.

212
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,113
One-on-one, I think a cat
will recognize its owner.

213
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,116
Let's start with you,
Mrs. Shagawa.

214
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,372
A-All right.

215
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:43,187
Hello, Mugi! It's me.
Do you recognize me?

216
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,735
Mugi!

217
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:51,495
I knew it, it really needs to be
my granddaughter, his real owner.

218
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:54,626
No, it would be
the same with her.

219
00:13:55,336 --> 00:14:00,012
Because the cat that you're looking
for is a girl, and this is a boy.

220
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,140
Wha-?

221
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,271
Isn't that right, Amuro? Yes. Remember what you said,
Mrs. Shagawa?

222
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:12,997
Your cat was at the vet's overnight,
and the stitches came out a week later.

223
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,500
Yes.

224
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:19,551
What you described is a female cat being
spayed, not a male cat being neutered.

225
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:22,389
Spaying is a rather
complicated procedure

226
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,604
where an abdominal incision is made
and the ovaries are removed.

227
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:28,402
Neutering is a simple procedure
where a small incision

228
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,158
is made in the scrotum
and the testes are removed,

229
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:32,534
so it's typically an
outpatient procedure.

230
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,752
All that's done is that a collar
like Mr. Masuko described

231
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,717
is put on the animal to keep it
from licking the incision.

232
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:46,230
Plus, you made it sound as if you and your
granddaughter both took care of the cat,

233
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,362
but the fact is, she only brought it
over sometimes, right?

234
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:53,494
After all, you don't know
how to act around cats.

235
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:58,379
They don't like to be looked in
the eye by anyone but their owner.

236
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:02,094
So when you called out
to Goro earlier,

237
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:06,395
she went over to Kogorou instead
because he showed no interest.

238
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:10,819
Something must have come up that kept
your granddaughter away for a long time.

239
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:15,662
You were asked to cat-sit, but she
vanished on you, am I right?

240
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,044
You're exactly right.

241
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:23,304
She was on a class trip, and her parents
used that as an excuse to travel abroad.

242
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,893
They asked me to look
after the cat,

243
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,942
but she never
warmed up to me.

244
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:34,493
I took my eyes off her for
a second, and she vanished.

245
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:37,164
Just as I was wracking
my brains for what to do,

246
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:41,173
I caught sight of the picture
of that cat in the magazine.

247
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:45,597
And you decided to try to replace
your missing cat with Poirot's.

248
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:49,982
But I think male and female cats
have different builds.

249
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:55,367
B-But my granddaughter is due back
from her class trip tonight!

250
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:59,626
If I don't do something before then,
I'll never live it down...

251
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,630
When did she really go missing?

252
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:04,636
Last night.
Right after I fed her.

253
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:08,769
I looked behind and under every piece
of furniture where a cat might fit,

254
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:12,526
as well as everything with an open
door, but there was no sign of her!

255
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,535
Then you should check everything
whose doors were closed.

256
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:20,084
In the restroom or the washing machine,
inside closets, that kind of thing.

257
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:25,219
Cats love to slip into places the
instant a human opens the door.

258
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:28,434
I-I'll go look again!

259
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,943
Sheesh, what a crazy old broad!

260
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:36,533
Okay, next! You try opening
the door this time, Mr. Amesawa.

261
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:38,912
Just like Mrs. Shagawa did.

262
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:42,796
Sure, I'd love nothing better!
But even before I open it,

263
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,051
it's already obvious
what's gonna happen.

264
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:48,432
He's right, Conan.
It'll be just like before.

265
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:51,522
Won't he jump into his arms
and start purring?

266
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:58,827
Hey, what's the deal?

267
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,622
Come to me like
you did last time!

268
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,376
Come on, you stupid cat!

269
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:06,218
Don't you know?

270
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:10,101
Catnip only works for
5 or 10 minutes.

271
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:16,530
After that, you're just some random,
scary guy who's yelling at him.

272
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:21,248
And to prove it, look at Goro,
who jumped on you that first time.

273
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,211
She's now terrified
and is staying clear of you.

274
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:27,844
If you were his real owner,

275
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:32,813
you wouldn't show up covered in
powdered catnip, now would you?

276
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:35,317
H-Hey, I can explain...

277
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:39,910
Plus, when Conan said that
the cat was a girl,

278
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,331
you instantly tried to back out.

279
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:46,340
If you had really seen that picture and
convinced yourself that it was your cat

280
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:50,597
and then come all the way here,
you would have fought harder.

281
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:55,941
You knew, didn't you? If that cat
was a female, it was worthless.

282
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,741
Worth what?
It's just a mixed breed.

283
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:02,121
For a female calico,
that would be true.

284
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:07,548
But only 1 in 1,000 are male since they
result from a chromosomal abnormality.

285
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:11,807
Their rarity is why maneki-neko
"lucky cat" statues are based on them.

286
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:16,983
They're worth at least $10,000, and I've
heard of some going for even $20,000.

287
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,865
- $20,000?!
- No way!

288
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:23,372
- That's amazing, Captain!
- You're as rare as a white lion!

289
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:27,296
How many broiled eel meals
could I buy with that much? Uh...

290
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,427
Someone like you, who obviously
knew his value,

291
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:33,850
would never let him
roam free in the big city.

292
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,104
I-I...

293
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:39,655
I'm sorry to bother you!

294
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,455
Now you give it a try,
Mr. Masuko.

295
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,168
O-Okay...

296
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,925
But I haven't seen him
in four months,

297
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:53,014
and it was usually my wife
who fed him.

298
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:58,150
He might react the same way
as he did to the others.

299
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,410
S-Soseki!

300
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:08,837
You remembered me, Soseki!

301
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:15,351
But why? It seemed like Captain was
waiting before the door was even open.

302
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:19,065
It was the sound.
Cats have great hearing.

303
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,950
They know the sound of their
owner's footsteps. I saw it on TV.

304
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:28,460
Hey, you said that he went missing
when you were moving.

305
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,886
You didn't happen to use the
Cheetah Moving Center, did you?

306
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:36,016
That's right.
How did you know?

307
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:39,733
Because this cat once
snuck into the back

308
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,948
of a truck belonging
to that same company.

309
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,244
Oh, I get it!
He did it because–

310
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:48,500
It's because he wanted to
get back to his owner!

311
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,424
He thought a truck with the same
logo on it would take him home!

312
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,805
Good for you, Captain!

313
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,196
Thank you for taking
such good care of him.

314
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:06,201
See ya, Captain!

315
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:07,663
Take care!

316
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,585
Don't run off again, okay?

317
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:18,352
This has my address
and email on it.

318
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,522
We'll work out a time,
and you can come visit him.

319
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,818
Really?! Thanks!

320
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,337
I never knew that cats were drawn
to the person in the middle.

321
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:34,049
Oh, that was a lie.

322
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:38,975
If you hadn't said that, you couldn't
have done that footstep experiment

323
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,604
so you had to bluff,
didn't you?

324
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,613
You put on an innocent smile
and kept your claws sheathed.

325
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,620
Because cats, get it?

326
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,873
Oh, it was a pun.

327
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,711
One Week Later

328
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,842
I wasn't expecting to hear
from that nice old man!

329
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,766
The detective agency got an email
saying that if we wanted to see the cat,

330
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,688
we should come over today!

331
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:27,818
-Yeah.
-It's only been a few days.

332
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,029
I wonder why?

333
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:34,875
Maybe he decided to give it up.
It seemed like he was allergic to cats.

334
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,962
Allergic to cats?

335
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:39,340
He had a cat even though
he was allergic?!

336
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:44,059
Well, some people get a cat without
knowing that they're allergic,

337
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:46,857
and some become allergic
while owning them.

338
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:50,447
But if he's allergic, he isn't
gonna sell him, is he?

339
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,704
$20,000 is a lot of money...

340
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:56,627
Isn't that the door to
Mr. Masuko's condo?

341
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,467
Just open the door!
I heard a strange noise from inside!

342
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:08,274
Mr. Masuko, it's the super!
Are you all right?

343
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,533
Huh? What's wrong with this cat?

344
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,955
Mister, is he hurt?

345
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:20,549
No, he isn't hurt,
but he has blood on his paws.

346
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,555
But that means... Has something
happened to Mr. Masuko?
