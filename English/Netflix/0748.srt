1
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:10,678
Um... Satou?

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,932
What's this "important matter"
you wanted to talk about?

3
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,433
Just get in.

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,560
Uh... Okay.

5
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:25,735
Hey, wait a minute.
This seems awfully familiar.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,738
As I recall, when I opened
the door that time...

7
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,538
I got you!
I got you good!

8
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,543
She thought it was the most
hilarious thing ever.

9
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,592
Okay, I'll fall for it again today,
hook, line and sinker.

10
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:53,095
Come on, give the pranks a rest!

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:56,975
Huh?

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,727
What are you doing?

13
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:04,148
Oh, um... I assumed you were
playing another practical joke.

14
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,735
I said this was important, didn't I?

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,155
That's what you said last time,
and then you pulled a prank on me.

16
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:15,618
- Listen...
- Yes?

17
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,580
Can't you tell what it is?

18
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:22,917
Can't I tell what what is?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,170
All I can tell is that you're
as lovely as ever–

20
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,840
Quit being an idiot!

21
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,885
Come on, just tell me what it is!

22
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:38,350
I'm missing my you-know-what.

23
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:42,312
Oh? You missed it?

24
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,858
Missed?! You don't mean–

25
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,528
It's embarrassing, so don't
tell anyone, got it?

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,530
O-Of course not!

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,618
What am I going to do? Someone's going
to have to take responsibility.

28
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,207
I-I'll do right by you.

29
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,792
Takagi...

30
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,672
Hang on... In cases of marriage
between police officers,

31
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:11,967
to say nothing of two officers
in the same precinct,

32
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:16,345
given the possibility of issues arising
from a married couple working together,

33
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,765
one of them is supposed
to transfer out.

34
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:22,602
Satou is the belle of Division 1,
so if I cause her to transfer out...

35
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,148
there's no telling what hell the senior
detectives will put me through.

36
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:32,945
So I'll have to transfer
to some other precinct.

37
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:37,117
No, I could resign and be
a stay-at-home dad.

38
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,577
Understood!

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,953
We're on our way.

40
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,915
We got a tip that a suspect we're after
was spotted in Beika Town.

41
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,877
We're going to check it out.

42
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,837
S-Sure!

43
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:00,973
-M-Miwako is having a baby?
-What happy news!

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,478
A chic and dashing detective show
that holds up under the blazing sun!

45
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,482
Will Satou finally profess
her feelings to Takagi?

46
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,650
A perfect alibi! A mystery written in
the language of flowers!

47
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,862
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

48
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,988
his name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,997
Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story
(Confessions)

50
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,383
Come on, all three of you
are yawning?

51
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,510
What are you, Haibara?

52
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,263
Well, excuse me
for yawning a lot.

53
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,557
We can't help it!

54
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:09,185
Titan Hunter just came out,
and it's too much fun!

55
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,603
We all got sucked into it.

56
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:15,025
Sheesh, you're wasting your precious
summer vacation playing some game?

57
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,780
Oh, right! I got my daddy to help me
and I made it to rank 5!

58
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:25,702
- Seriously?
- I keep getting eaten by the blue titan!

59
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,662
What kind of game is this?

60
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,082
From what I hear,
it's a roleplaying game

61
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:33,668
where you protect your castle
from a race of attacking titans.

62
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,757
Now that you mention it, the strategy
guide goes on sale today, doesn't it?

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,092
Wow, right!

64
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,220
Hey, do you think they have it
in that mini-mart over there?

65
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,680
Let's go see!

66
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,265
Hey!

67
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,850
I thought we were going to
go play soccer in the park!

68
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,312
I guess not.

69
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,023
Damn it...

70
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,777
Was there an accident there?

71
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,905
And those flowers...

72
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,033
I think those are called
false dragonheads.

73
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,243
They signify...

74
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,203
Edogawa.

75
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,332
What are you doing?
Keep up.

76
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,708
Oh. Sure.

77
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,800
That sure was a surprise.

78
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,593
I can't believe a total stranger
looked so much like our suspect.

79
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,345
That's for sure.

80
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,852
It's a little late, but do you want to
grab lunch somewhere around here?

81
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,268
Oh, sure!

82
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,938
How about pickles and
ice cream or something?

83
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,858
Huh? Why would I want that?

84
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,360
Whoa, awesome!

85
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,905
- This says it's called the Haouken!
- It's so cool!

86
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:51,245
It says its ATK stat is over 10,000, and
is the only blade feared by the titans!

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,375
It's B&amp;W, so you can't tell
what it really looks like, though.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,170
It says here that you can only
get it if you're rank 8

89
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,338
and defeat a big-ass, red titan!

90
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,717
I won't be getting it
anytime soon...

91
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,510
Oh, I have that sword.

92
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,847
Its hilt is shiny and gold,
and the design on the blade is red!

93
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,973
Noriya Makabe (7)
1st-year Grade School Student

94
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,893
It seems like you still need
to get a bunch of buff items

95
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,688
to level up the sword
afterwards, though.

96
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:20,650
Oh, wow!
You made rank 8, then?

97
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,442
Yep!

98
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,153
Hang on, aren't you in
the class next to ours?

99
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:27,073
You aren't lying to make yourself
sound cool, are you?

100
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,992
I'm not lying!

101
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,952
Right, big brother Toshinari?

102
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,287
That's right.

103
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,913
You worked hard for it.

104
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,125
Huh? That's the guy
from the street...

105
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:41,628
If you really got the Haouken,
I'd sure love to see it!

106
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,757
-Me, too!
-Me, too!

107
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,885
Want to come over to
Toshinari's place, then?

108
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:50,513
It's okay, isn't it?

109
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,267
Toshinari Shiga (25)
Graduate Student

110
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,352
Wait for me in the car, then.
I'll go pay our bill.

111
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,107
That comes to 1,350 yen.

112
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,733
Put it on my card, please.

113
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,985
- Of course. Number of payments?
- One-time charge.

114
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,905
Of course.

115
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,657
He drives an import
and has a platinum card...

116
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,492
Maybe he's a trust fund kid.

117
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,748
Whoa!

118
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,377
This place is a dump!

119
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,170
Hush, Genta!

120
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,632
It may not look like much,
but home is where you make it.

121
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,885
I'll park the car,
so you go on inside.

122
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,137
Okay!

123
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,725
Apartment #3
SHIGA

124
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,937
Whoa, it's really the Haouken!

125
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,272
The grip really is shiny and gold!

126
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,775
- It's so pretty...
- Awesome!

127
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,652
Sheesh...

128
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:51,908
It's full of junk food, instant noodles
and mini-mart bento boxes.

129
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,412
Their diet is on display here.

130
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,582
- Hey, Haibara.
- What?

131
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,417
Did you smell something?

132
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,002
Not really.

133
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,797
I don't think there's any
kitchen garbage in here.

134
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:08,508
No, in the hall
before we came in.

135
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,635
No, I didn't notice anything.

136
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,678
You didn't?

137
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:25,317
Hey, where do you get off
poking around someone's home?

138
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,652
Tell me something, Noriya...

139
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,530
Did your brother just move here?

140
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,077
No, it was about a month ago.

141
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,328
Before summer vacation, he lived in
the same condo building as my folks.

142
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,335
And Toshinari isn't my brother.
He's my cousin.

143
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,713
He's the son of
my mom's older sister.

144
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:51,508
My dad is on an overseas
business trip right now,

145
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,762
and Mom has left for a week
to take care of him,

146
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,140
so I'm staying here with Toshinari
while she's away.

147
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,060
You're staying here
for a week?

148
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:04,605
Yeah. Plus, Mom asked me
to do something for her.

149
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,568
Toshinari's big sister died in
a traffic accident six months ago.

150
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,197
He's been really
sad ever since,

151
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:16,575
so Mom asked me to stay with him
and cheer him up.

152
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:21,580
Then he was laying those flowers
at the spot where she died...

153
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:25,835
Oh, right! I got him to show me
some pictures of her earlier!

154
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:31,465
She was really nice. She used to
take me camping all the time.

155
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:36,095
Huh? Were there this
many pictures before?

156
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,263
Can I see?

157
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,390
Sure.

158
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:50,735
That's strange. She isn't looking into
the camera in any of these last ones.

159
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:56,908
And what are these? There are little
holes in the tops of the pictures.

160
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,373
Th-That was Toshinari!

161
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,710
The hallway...
Don't tell me--

162
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,047
It was coming from
apartment #4?

163
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,512
I knew it, that smell was...

164
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,223
Conan?

165
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,017
What is it?

166
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,560
The rest of you, stay back!

167
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:28,607
Haibara, call the police.
Tell them someone has died here.

168
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,317
On it.

169
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,035
What's that?

170
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,040
The pictures pinned up
on this cork board...

171
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,045
The pictures and the sun-bleached
areas don't quite line up.

172
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,465
And it's not just
one or two of them.

173
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,300
What could cause that?

174
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:01,723
She isn't looking
into the camera...

175
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,560
There are little holes in
the tops of the pictures...

176
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,898
I don't believe it.

177
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,485
The culprit who did this is...

178
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,988
It can't be...

179
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,247
I have to say,

180
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,542
I had no idea things had progressed
so far with those two.

181
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,128
They're gonna get hitched
for sure now.

182
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,465
Things are gonna get dangerous
for Takagi, though.

183
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,258
Hm? Dangerous how?

184
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:41,053
Imagine what'll happen when
the detectives find out.

185
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,723
Oh, you have a point.

186
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,225
Detective Satou has a big fan club.

187
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:50,105
- He's in trouble. Seriously.
- He sure is.

188
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,982
In serious trouble.

189
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,195
Um... Yumi?

190
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,573
Your mouth is saying one thing,
but your face is saying another.

191
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:10,333
The victim is Hiroto Yasutomi.
Age 31, job hopper.

192
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,335
Forensics puts
estimated time of death

193
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,757
sometime between
7:00 and 9:00 last night.

194
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,718
Repeated stabbings to
the chest and abdomen, huh?

195
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:24,263
Then you were the first
person to find the body?

196
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:28,518
You're Toshinari Shiga,
the next-door neighbor?

197
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,187
Yes.

198
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,772
I had parked my car
in the lot,

199
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,067
and when I was going
to my own apartment,

200
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,277
I noticed a strange smell
coming from this one.

201
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:41,907
The door was unlocked, so I let myself in.
That's when I found him like this.

202
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,908
I shouted in surprise,
and that's when this boy,

203
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,537
a friend of my cousin Noriya's,
barged in.

204
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,830
Conan?

205
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,585
Then the girl who reported
the body was...

206
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,045
Me.

207
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:59,923
We all came over to hang out
at Noriya's cousin's place today.

208
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,720
I have to say, you're every bit
the angel of death that Mr. Mouri is.

209
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,265
I keep finding you
at murder scenes.

210
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:11,687
G-Gosh, you two sure arrived
at the scene quickly.

211
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:18,527
We got a tip that an employee at a nearby
florist's looked like a wanted suspect.

212
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,738
It turned out to be
a false alarm, though.

213
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:27,202
We happened to be in the neighborhood,
so we caught the case.

214
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:32,415
If Takagi hadn't been whispering
with that employee about flowers,

215
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,000
we could have gone
straight back.

216
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,753
We were still in the area
because we were eating lunch!

217
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,048
You were talking about flowers?

218
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:41,590
Are you gonna give
some to somebody?

219
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,760
If it was to Det. Satou, he wouldn't
have been whispering about it!

220
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:46,595
He must be cheating. You think so, too?

221
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,932
I-I am not!

222
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:51,893
To get back on track...

223
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:55,397
If he died between
7:00 and 9:00 last night,

224
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,358
why don't you ask
Noriya and Toshinari about it?

225
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:03,070
They were next door, so they might have
heard strange sounds or something.

226
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:07,492
During those hours last night,
I was watching TV with Toshinari!

227
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,203
The Kamen Yaiba movie was on.

228
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,038
I watched that, too!

229
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:16,292
Me, too! Wasn't it awesome?!

230
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,213
It was on from 7:00 to 9:00
for its first TV broadcast!

231
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:25,593
You didn't hear any strange sounds
or moaning while it was on?

232
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,847
Yeah! During the movie,
our neighbor banged on the door

233
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,975
and yelled at us
to turn it down.

234
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,435
Around what time was that?

235
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,855
I think it must have been
around 7:30.

236
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,985
I apologized through the door
and turned down the volume.

237
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:47,198
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi
was still alive at that time.

238
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:49,367
Did you hear anything
strange after that?

239
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,078
Well... Kamen Yaiba is one
of those superhero shows,

240
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,958
so there was a lot of screaming
and explosions.

241
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,545
Even if there had been any strange
noises, I might not have noticed.

242
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:04,465
Besides, his body was found
by his kitchen sink,

243
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,137
which is two rooms away from
where we were watching TV.

244
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:14,392
Come to think of it, I saw him at
the mini-mart yesterday evening.

245
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,062
Around what time?

246
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:21,273
Well, it was when we were buying
bento boxes for dinner.

247
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,818
I remember being worried about
their expiration date

248
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,322
and asking Noriya
what day it was.

249
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,990
You asked a child
what the date was?

250
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,785
Yeah! I was holding
the shopping basket.

251
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,288
It had a newspaper in it
that we were going to buy.

252
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:40,377
I told him that "August 13th"
was written on it.

253
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:43,045
I said that was the day that the Kamen
Yaiba movie was gonna be on TV.

254
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,923
If it was the 13th, that means
it was yesterday.

255
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,927
When you saw him,
was Mr. Yasutomi with anyone?

256
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:53,390
No, I think he was by himself.

257
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:57,393
Say, Noriya... Did Toshinari get up
to go to the bathroom or anything

258
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,147
while you were watching
the movie?

259
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,692
No, I was sitting against him
the whole time.

260
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,195
What did you do
after it was over?

261
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,947
It ended before 9:00, right?

262
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:14,743
Yeah! I went to pee right after it ended
and then I went back to playing my game.

263
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,330
"Went back to"? You were
playing it before the movie, too?

264
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:23,293
Yeah, I played from the time we got back
from the store until the movie started.

265
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:26,630
Toshinari looked at
his watch and said,

266
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,633
"Oh, no! It's already 7:00!

267
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:32,012
The movie's starting, so we'd
better save our game."

268
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:35,473
We saved it real fast
and switched it back to cable.

269
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:38,602
We did it just in time, because
the movie had just started!

270
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,938
While you were in the bathroom
after the movie ended,

271
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,567
Toshinari didn't leave
the apartment?

272
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:50,030
Nope, he asked me what kind of snacks
I wanted from outside the bathroom door.

273
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,240
Then you played your game together
all evening after that?

274
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:56,618
That's right! We played
until pretty late,

275
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:59,622
and then after I got up early
and played some more,

276
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:03,460
I went to the store with Toshinari
to go buy breakfast.

277
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:06,880
After that, I played
until around noon or so.

278
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,965
Then I got tired,
so I took a nap.

279
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,135
After I woke up,
I played some more,

280
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:15,763
and then I got hungry,
so we went to the store.

281
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,265
And that's when
I ran into you guys! Talk about gaming
night and day!

282
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,937
That's why your rank
was so high!

283
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,438
I'm jealous!

284
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:27,275
What about lunch, then?

285
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:31,195
Oh, I'd been snacking all day,
so I wasn't hungry at all.

286
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,865
Snacking and gaming all day!

287
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,617
-That's so great!
-I'd call that Heaven!

288
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:38,953
Don't follow his example.

289
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:43,417
So you were with Toshinari
all day again today?

290
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,503
After we ate breakfast, he said
he had an errand to run,

291
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,963
so I should play my game
while he was out.

292
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,635
He didn't want the man next door
to get mad at us again,

293
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:56,095
so he said to play
with headphones on.

294
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,640
When was that?

295
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:00,392
Let me think...

296
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,520
It was around 6 o'clock when we
went to the store to buy breakfast,

297
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,857
and that was right after
we came home and ate it,

298
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,900
so I guess that
was around 7:00.

299
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:14,238
The clock behind the cashier at
the store said it was just after 6:00.

300
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,743
What? Do you suspect
the brother?

301
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,080
Excuse me...

302
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:25,625
Would you mind if we went
back to my apartment?

303
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,503
I'd rather not make these kids
hang around a dead body.

304
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,213
Good point.

305
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:35,885
Just to rule you out, I'd like to go
through your garbage and things.

306
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,222
-Is that all right?
-Sure, that's fine.

307
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,725
Hey, I know you!

308
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:45,270
You weren't at the
florist's earlier, were you?

309
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:48,357
Yes, I bought some flowers.

310
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,067
I thought so!

311
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,238
When I asked what kind of flowers
to give someone when a wish comes true,

312
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,367
the guy there said, "How about
a bouquet of false dragonheads

313
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,493
like that man just bought?"

314
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:06,040
I caught a glimpse of you
just as you were leaving.

315
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:09,335
So you just got some
good news, Detective Takagi?

316
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,378
Did you win a prize
on your ice cream stick?

317
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,797
C'mon, tell us!

318
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,425
Uh, well...
Help me out here!

319
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,218
Huh? Why?

320
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,888
I said I'd do right
by you, didn't I?

321
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:22,807
Oh, that.

322
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,228
Well, you're partly to blame
for my little situation.

323
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,813
I'd say it's only natural that you
man up and do the right thing.

324
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,610
Y-You have a point.

325
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,780
That's the flower you bought?

326
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,947
Yes.

327
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,573
In that case,

328
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,868
did you also have some kind
of wish come true?

329
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,873
Y-Yes... I suppose.

330
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:53,713
Mr. Shiga. Shall we go to
your apartment, then?

331
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:55,257
S-Sure...

332
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,220
Say, Detective Takagi.

333
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,888
What is it, Conan?

334
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:05,392
There's something I'd like you
to find out for me.

335
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,980
Toshinari placed those flowers
by the road in front of that florist's,

336
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,608
so I was wondering if there
had been an accident there.

337
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:17,362
- Oh, he did?
- Come on. Quit dawdling, Takagi.

338
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,363
S-Sure...

339
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,992
- Get a move on!
- Should you be exerting yourself, Satou?

340
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,660
You should be taking it easy!

341
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,250
He's probably the one who
murdered Mr. Yasutomi.

342
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:34,753
It was Toshinari Shiga,
I'm sure of it.

343
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,758
And the murder weapon
is probably in...

344
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,178
But the problem is his alibi.

345
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:48,435
At the time of the murder, 7:00 to 9:00
on the evening of August 13th,

346
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,607
he was right next to
Noriya the whole time.

347
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,358
Damn it...

348
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,903
How the hell did you
murder Mr. Yasutomi?

349
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,283
Well?

350
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,412
Takagi? Did you get some
good news today, then?
