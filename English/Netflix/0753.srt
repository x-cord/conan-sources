1
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:07,640
Ran is the toughest member
of the karate club?

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:12,567
You better believe it, Yasuko!
She can kick even the boys' butts!

3
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,365
Come on, Yayoi!
You're exaggerating!

4
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:16,701
Yasuko Kawagami (25)
Office Worker

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:18,371
That's amazing! You must be
a karate master!

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,417
No, not even close...

7
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,965
Anyway, I'm proud of her as her
senpai in the karate club.

8
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:25,218
Yayoi Yajima (21)
College Student

9
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,642
Oh, no! It's that late already?
I have to take my bath!

10
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,981
I should get going, then.

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:36,114
You came all this way to visit,
so stay a while longer!

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,742
You have a ride coming, right?

13
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:39,204
Yes, I guess...

14
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:42,960
Then stay! After all, we're just
getting to know each other!

15
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,092
- Yeah!
- I'm back.

16
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,720
Welcome home, Mr. Suzuki.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,848
Thanks.

18
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,603
This is Ran Mouri, an underclassman
at my school.

19
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:53,065
I'll try not to be a bother.

20
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,359
Hidehisa Suzuki (26)
Office Worker

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,612
Nice to meet you.
I'm Suzuki.

22
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,618
Oh, right.
Would you like some cake?

23
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:03,545
Are you sure?
I'm a Peeping Tom.

24
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,885
No one believes that.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,312
It tastes best 15 minutes after it's
taken out of the fridge, so wait a bit.

26
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:13,773
I'm home.

27
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,111
Welcome back.

28
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,585
Oh, you're still here, Mr. Suzuki?

29
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:24,461
Katsuko Kanou (25)
Dancer

30
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,717
I thought the landlord told you
to pack your things and get out.

31
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:31,768
You lied to him about me
being a Peeping Tom!

32
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,772
Hey, it'll make life easier
if it's just us girls here.

33
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:35,983
This is serious!

34
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,280
Please, we have a visitor.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,327
Don't be like this, Katsuko.

36
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:42,247
Oh, Yayoi.

37
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,792
Do you have any right to
talk to me like that?

38
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:49,886
Oh, well. I need to get in some
tap practice before my bath.

39
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,264
Um, Katsuko?

40
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,143
What?

41
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:57,194
I've been asking you for ages, but could
you please stop practicing tap upstairs?

42
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,533
My room is directly
beneath yours.

43
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,204
So please...

44
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:07,130
W-We have cake.
You like cake, right?

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,092
-Trying to butter me up, huh?
-Of course not...

46
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:12,056
I'll get it later.

47
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,452
Okay, I'm going to take a bath.

48
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:23,203
Sure.

49
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,712
I'm sorry, Ran. I wish you
didn't have to see that.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,424
Don't mention it.

51
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:35,645
Oh, don't worry. Mr. Suzuki
won't peek in on her.

52
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:39,361
That's just a lie that Katsuko
spread for kicks.

53
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,656
Please, just drop it.

54
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,873
I'm going to hash things out
with that woman later.

55
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:49,214
Thanks for the cake.
I'll eat it in my room.

56
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,593
Make yourself at home.

57
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:53,471
Thank you.

58
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,321
A chic, stylish detective show
that's like an autumn breeze

59
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:03,074
blowing away the lingering summer heat!

60
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,911
A shocking incident in an apartment house!

61
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:06,831
What's the trick behind
the manufactured alibi?

62
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,879
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

63
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,260
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:44,361
The Blind Spot
in the Share House

65
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,075
I guess life in a share house
can be complicated.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,333
When I stepped in the door,
I thought it was really fancy.

67
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,592
The door to this common area
has glass panes,

68
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:58,346
and there's a decorative
potted plant...

69
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:02,855
It's been remodeled so that everyone
can live here smoothly.

70
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:06,363
After all, we're perfect strangers
living together,

71
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:09,118
so that can be nerve-wracking.

72
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,997
That's why there are lots of rules.

73
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,166
Rules?

74
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,129
Yes. Look at the back
of your chair.

75
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,134
"Guest"

76
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,892
Rules like, "Put a name tag
on your personal items."

77
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:21,643
"Guest"

78
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:23,062
Wow, you're right.

79
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:25,902
That hit the spot!

80
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,155
I'll take mine, then.

81
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,283
Sure.

82
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,579
So, what were you talking about?

83
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:36,506
Gossiping about you. Like how you keep
forgetting to take out the trash.

84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,803
It keeps slipping my mind.

85
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:42,644
She said everything is worked out,
even the cleaning rotation and bath times.

86
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:43,520
"Bath Times"

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,314
You even have
a message board.

88
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,153
It's complicated.

89
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:51,828
True, but the rent is way cheaper
than market rate.

90
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,125
So no one wants to leave.

91
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,177
Oh, Yasuko?

92
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:03,350
Katsuko's piece of cake?

93
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:04,896
Okay.

94
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:09,363
Sure, if she doesn't come down
in 15 minutes, I'll put it back.

95
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,207
Yayoi, I'll help out!

96
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,008
I can handle a few dishes.
You're my guest, remember?

97
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:21,554
That's weird.

98
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,307
Is something wrong?

99
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,144
No, it's nothing.

100
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:33,327
Um, did something happen
between you and Katsuko?

101
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,086
She didn't come
for her cake, did she?

102
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,555
"Katsuko"

103
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:48,357
I... owe her money.

104
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,486
Money?

105
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:57,794
Oh, I didn't know that your
father passed away suddenly.

106
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:02,094
My brother's still in middle school,
and that costs a lot,

107
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:04,516
so I can't ask them
to waste money on me.

108
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:09,942
But it's okay. I'm getting by on
scholarships and part-time work.

109
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:15,455
Hey, Katsuko never came down.

110
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,128
Really? I swear, she can't
even accept a gift.

111
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,176
That might be them!

112
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,427
It's your ride.

113
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:24,305
Coming!

114
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:28,730
I'm sorry to force you to look after
my daughter until so late at night!

115
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,357
Let's go home, Ran!

116
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:33,866
Yayoi, Yasuko,
thanks for having me.

117
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:35,995
-Come visit us again.
-Thanks, I will!

118
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,424
What's wrong?!

119
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:44,220
-What happened?!
-Mr. Suzuki!

120
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,098
I-In there...

121
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,685
K-Katsuko, she's...

122
00:07:57,078 --> 00:08:00,545
The victim's name is Katsuko Kanou.
Age, 25.

123
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:05,177
Forensics says the knife found at the
scene is definitely the murder weapon,

124
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:07,767
but there were no prints on it.

125
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:12,527
Estimated time of death
is between 7:15 and 7:45 PM.

126
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:18,162
Also, they found traces of
sleeping pills in the liquid

127
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,918
inside the bottle
that was on the floor.

128
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,759
So she was stabbed to death
while she was unconscious, huh?

129
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:28,432
All right, since you were the one
who found the body, Mr. Suzuki,

130
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,605
describe the events
leading up to then.

131
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,191
O-Of course.

132
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:37,493
This morning, there was a message to me
from Katsuko on the message board.

133
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:43,546
"I'll stop by your room before
8:00 tonight. Let's talk things out."

134
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,597
I don't see anything of
the sort written here.

135
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,020
Did any of the other
residents see it?

136
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:54,151
It said to keep it secret!

137
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,989
So I erased it myself.

138
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,957
Plus, I'm always the last
to leave the house,

139
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,758
so Katsuko probably wrote it so
I would be the only one to see it.

140
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,511
And?

141
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:10,810
I waited in my room
like she asked.

142
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:14,651
But 8:00 came and went
and she never showed up.

143
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,364
So I went to her room
to check on her,

144
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,038
and that's when I found her
on her bed.

145
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:22,834
Really, now?

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,462
It's the truth!
You've got to believe me!

147
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,698
Y-You're wrong!
I didn't do it!

148
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:43,124
Tell them! Yayoi! Yasuko!

149
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,134
Oh? Is there something that
you two would like to say?

150
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:56,025
Well, Mr. Suzuki and Katsuko have
been quarreling nonstop lately.

151
00:09:56,108 --> 00:10:00,660
They even got into it again before
they went to their rooms tonight.

152
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,665
-Ran, is this true?
-Yes...

153
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,301
I'm not the only one! You two
hated her just as much as I did!

154
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:13,559
Wait! I don't think they had
anything to do with it!

155
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,649
Ran, how do you know that?

156
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:21,283
Between 7:00 and 8:00, they were either
taking their baths as scheduled

157
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:24,040
or were in here with me.

158
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,002
"As scheduled"?

159
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,922
They're scheduled.

160
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:31,679
The bath times.
Since it's a share house.

161
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:38,901
Yes. And aside from one restroom visit,
I was sitting right here the whole time.

162
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,368
I have an unobstructed view of
the hall through the glass door.

163
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,206
A glass sliding door, eh?

164
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:50,091
You can see everything, all right.
So, to go upstairs from the bathroom...

165
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,430
You have to
go down that hall.

166
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:58,524
I'm positive that no one came by
while Yasuko was in the bath.

167
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,533
I see. So both of them
have solid alibis, eh?

168
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:04,996
In that case, Mr. Suzuki,

169
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,002
I'm sorry, but would you mind
going back to the murder scene

170
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:12,259
and describing exactly how
it looked when you found it?

171
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:13,512
All right.

172
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,604
"Write your name on your
personal belongings," huh?

173
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,032
Come to think of it, her name was on the
bottle at the murder scene, wasn't it?

174
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,955
Want something to drink, kiddo?

175
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,000
No, that's all right.

176
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,796
You don't have to be polite.

177
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,426
Say, is that piece
of cake Katsuko's?

178
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:33,720
"Katsuko"

179
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,059
That's right, I even took it
out of the fridge for her.

180
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,524
Yasuko called from the
bathroom and asked me to.

181
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,571
Well, I was naked at the time...

182
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:46,078
But she never
came down to eat it.

183
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,085
That's why I put it back
in the fridge.

184
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,298
Cake tastes best 15 minutes
after being taken out.

185
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:55,096
I want people to eat it
when it's at its best.

186
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,602
Oh, right...

187
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,150
What is it, Conan?

188
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,866
It's nothing. Was there anything
else that seemed odd?

189
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:06,744
Seemed odd?

190
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,417
Oh, now that you mention it...

191
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:14,927
Yayoi, when you were doing
the dishes, you looked puzzled.

192
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:17,850
Yayoi, I'll help!

193
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:21,565
I can handle a few dishes.
You're my guest, remember?

194
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,527
That's weird.

195
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:30,416
Oh, that. The hot water pressure usually
drops when someone is in the bath.

196
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,172
But it was flowing normally.

197
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:35,762
The bath's that way, right?

198
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,765
Hey! Conan!

199
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,458
There's more here.

200
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,548
Residue that was wiped up
and residue that was stepped in.

201
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:55,927
What's wrong?

202
00:12:56,427 --> 00:13:00,267
Um, what is this stuff?

203
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,773
Oh, no!

204
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,867
It's shampoo. I was refilling
the bottle today, and some spilled.

205
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:12,041
I thought I had wiped it all up,
but it looks like I missed some.

206
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,220
A window.

207
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,604
The dining room is visible.

208
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:26,612
Which means the killer must have...

209
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,743
Why is this one patch lighter?

210
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:32,959
There was a picture hanging there,

211
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,629
but the landlord
took it down yesterday.

212
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:37,927
That's...

213
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,263
Detective Megure!

214
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:40,681
Come here! Quickly!

215
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:53,707
This towel was found in
Mr. Suzuki's shoe cubby.

216
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,716
I see. So that's how it is...

217
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,140
It was you who committed
the murder, Mr. Suzuki!

218
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,858
There was bad blood between you
and Katsuko from the beginning.

219
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,030
And the quarrel tonight was
the last straw for you,

220
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,410
and you murdered
her upstairs!

221
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:15,126
During the murder, you wrapped
the handle of the knife in this towel

222
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,129
so that you would leave
no fingerprints.

223
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,889
You then hid it with the intention
of disposing of it later!

224
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:24,143
Open and shut, right, Detective?

225
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:30,281
Hidehisa Suzuki, will you come to
the station as our prime suspect?

226
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,454
It wasn't me!
I didn't do it!

227
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,086
They're wrong.
He's not the killer.

228
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,176
The culprit is one of these two.

229
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,650
So that's how it went down!

230
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,910
Oh, my!
What in the world?

231
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,168
Please wait, everyone.

232
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,091
Mr. Mouri? Are you...

233
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:04,641
It's too soon to conclude that
the murderer was Mr. Suzuki.

234
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,648
But Mouri, you just said...

235
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,569
For which I am truly ashamed.

236
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,620
A single glance at Mr. Suzuki
should have made it clear.

237
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,002
Think back to the murder scene.

238
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,175
Katsuko died from
a severed artery,

239
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:24,180
and everything around her body
was covered in blood spray.

240
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:28,605
And yet, look at him. Mr. Suzuki's
sweatshirt is perfectly clean.

241
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,864
Could the killer have gotten away
without being covered in blood?

242
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,164
What if he changed his clothes and
then pretended to find the body?

243
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:41,298
If that were the case, those clothes
would have been found already.

244
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,927
He didn't have time
to get rid of them.

245
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,639
Y-You have a point.

246
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,936
But if that's the case,
who is the killer?

247
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,068
This is how the killer did it:

248
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,489
First, he pretended
to be Katsuko

249
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:57,163
and left a message for Mr. Suzuki
on the message board.

250
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,713
This was to keep Mr. Suzuki in his
room at the time of the murder

251
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,176
to ensure that he didn't
have an alibi.

252
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,265
And then,

253
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:10,606
at the time of the murder, he slipped
out of the bathroom and went upstairs.

254
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:14,490
Just a minute, Mouri.
According to Ran's statement,

255
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,871
no one passed by in the hall
at the time of the murder.

256
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:19,666
Conan!

257
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,213
Right here!
Detective Takagi!

258
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,013
Do you see that big potted plant
in front of that door?

259
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,683
Look below it.

260
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,729
-Aren't those scuff marks?
-Oh.

261
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:33,860
Try moving it towards the door
following the scuff marks.

262
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,033
Like this?

263
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,080
And now, will you go into
the hall and close the door?

264
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,374
Got it.

265
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,048
Ran, go over to
the refrigerator,

266
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:47,764
and when your dad gives
the signal, open the door.

267
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:49,351
Okay, got it.

268
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:51,022
Come over here, everybody.

269
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,946
Keep your eyes
on Detective Takagi, okay?

270
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,913
All right, Ran! Open the
refrigerator door!

271
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,292
Okay.

272
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:04,381
W-Well, I'll be!

273
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,093
Do you see?

274
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:10,476
Detective Takagi is no longer
visible from where Ran was sitting.

275
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:15,444
Conan told me that before and
after the time of the murder,

276
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,492
the refrigerator's door
was opened two times.

277
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:23,460
To take out and return
Katsuko's piece of cake.

278
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,349
Prior to the murder, the culprit moved
the plant while Ran was in restroom.

279
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,980
And then used it to slip unnoticed
out of the bathroom.

280
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,487
There is even evidence
that proves it.

281
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,538
The killer stepped in the spilled
shampoo in the changing room.

282
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:45,003
Traces of it were left
in the hallway.

283
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:48,344
And then, he made a dash
for Katsuko's room

284
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,017
in the instant the
refrigerator door was open.

285
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:57,236
There, Katsuko was out cold from
the pills she had inadvertently taken.

286
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,033
The killer then quietly
slipped in, and...

287
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:09,553
Afterwards, he put the blood-stained
towel in Mr. Suzuki's shoe cubby

288
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,563
and went back, this time in the instant
the door was opened to return the cake.

289
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,529
He would then simply have to wait for
a chance to move the potted plant back.

290
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:21,702
Wait, Dad!
That means that I...

291
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:26,212
Ran, you were being used
to manufacture an alibi.

292
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:29,300
Because guests always
sit in that chair.

293
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:32,933
Wait! I was the one who
opened the refrigerator!

294
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:36,565
That means that the killer is...
Yasuko?!

295
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,325
I'm the killer?!
That's crazy! You're wrong!

296
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,579
Gosh, lady...

297
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,291
Did you hurt your shoulder?

298
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,128
I see blood.

299
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,685
That is proof that you went
upstairs and came back down.

300
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:58,609
Take a look at the window
looking out onto the stairs.

301
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:03,869
It might be high up, but when
Yasuko committed the crime,

302
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,208
she didn't want to be seen.

303
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:11,177
So she crouched down, and when she
thought it was safe to stand again...

304
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:14,348
Yes...

305
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:19,568
A nail was sticking out of the wall at
shoulder height just past the window.

306
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:25,329
Hey, wait! You just said that Mr. Suzuki
wasn't covered in blood, remember?

307
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:29,838
My clothes don't have any of
Katsuko's blood on them, either!

308
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:33,345
It became clear the instant
I saw your injury.

309
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:38,897
There is a scrape on your shoulder from
the nail. But your T-shirt isn't torn!

310
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:44,115
There probably isn't a tear in what
you were wearing before that, either.

311
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,705
How can this be explained?

312
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:51,632
After you went to the bathroom,
you took off all your clothes

313
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,681
and murdered Katsuko
in the nude!

314
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:09,208
You then wiped off the blood with the
towel you'd wrapped the knife handle in,

315
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,213
then cautiously made
your way back

316
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,967
so that you wouldn't leave
a trail on the floor,

317
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,473
and washed off the blood
in the shower.

318
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,852
You're wrong! I--

319
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,734
Shall we examine the
shower's drain, then?

320
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:26,993
You can be certain that we'll find
traces of Katsuko's blood!

321
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,219
Yasuko... Why?

322
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,857
Clack, clack, clack, clack!
Every night, all I heard

323
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,486
was the sound of her tap shoes
from right overhead!

324
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:46,617
I asked her again and again,
but she wouldn't stop!

325
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,706
I couldn't take it anymore!

326
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,711
You killed her over that?

327
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:56,092
She said something to me...

328
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,932
Actually, it feels amazing!

329
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,648
It's like I'm stomping on you
from over your head.

330
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,236
So suck it up.

331
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:08,494
That's all a third-rate nobody like you

332
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,504
is good to me for.

333
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:42,013
Mouri Detective Agency

334
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,392
Dad! Dad!

335
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,812
I had a great idea!

336
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:47,148
Huh?

337
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,114
Let's turn our place into a share house!
It'll really help with our finances.

338
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,743
Don't be silly.

339
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:58,672
Darn, I had a hot career woman who
makes a ton of money all lined up...

340
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,259
What a shame.

341
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,060
Well, if it will help out
with the family finances...

342
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,897
You mean it? That's great!

343
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:07,731
ERI KISAKI

344
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:09,820
I'll go put this on
our spare room, then!

345
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:13,201
We'll be living
as a family again!

346
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,330
I need to give Mom
the good news!

347
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:17,501
W-Wait! Ran! Stop that!

348
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,718
-Give me the phone! Hand it over!
-Mom? It's me!

349
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:25,308
Hang on, Kisaki's cooking is...
