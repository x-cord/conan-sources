1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:04,547
After we settled the dispute over
who owned Captain, a male calico,

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:08,217
we went to visit him at the home
of Mr. Masuko, the man we determined

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,220
to be his real owner, but then...

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,602
Huh? What's wrong with this cat?

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,395
Mister, is he hurt?

6
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:25,110
No, he doesn't seem to be hurt,
but he has blood on his paws.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,112
But that means... Has something
happened to Mr. Masuko?

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,073
Oh, no!

9
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,163
A chic, stylish detective show
that's like an autumn breeze

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,915
blowing away the lingering summer heat!

11
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,625
A locked room mystery
with the Boy Detectives!

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,502
What's the secret of the cute calico?

13
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:45,880
Always determining the one truth with the
body of a child and the mind of an adult,

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,425
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:20,058
The Case of the Lucky Calico
(Part 2)

16
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,562
Mr. Masuko! If you're okay,
say something!

17
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,272
Mr. Masuko!

18
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:29,567
Son, he might just be asleep.

19
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,070
I mean, the door guard
is latched.

20
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,490
But you said that you heard
a strange sound next door, right?

21
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:39,743
Yes, a loud thud, like something
had slammed into something else.

22
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,500
Plus, Mr. Masuko's cat
has blood on his paws.

23
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,418
Something happened inside!

24
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,297
Haibara, call an ambulance.

25
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:51,172
On it.

26
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,675
Do any of you guys
have some string?

27
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,220
I also need tape and
some kind of wire.

28
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,430
I have yarn!

29
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,975
And I have some adhesive bandages.

30
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,977
I have a paper clip!

31
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,188
What are you gonna do
with all this stuff?

32
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,523
Open this door guard.

33
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,778
First, I'll tie the yarn to the
door guard's U-shaped bar.

34
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,408
Then I'll stick the knot to the end
of the bar with the bandage.

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,368
Then I'll thread the yarn
through the paper clip.

36
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:25,957
And once I stick the paper clip to the
door with another bandage, we're ready.

37
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,545
If I shut the door and give
the yarn a good tug...

38
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,005
It opened!

39
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:35,675
Which one's your condo, mister?

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,593
That one there.

41
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,263
So it came from the one closest
to the neighbor's place...

42
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:43,098
-Go in and turn left!
-Hey! Conan!

43
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,767
The room at the end
of the hall?

44
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,983
-Looks like an accident.
-Yes.

45
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,780
He put the chair on the bed and was
trying to change the fluorescent bulb

46
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,782
when he lost his balance and fell
headfirst onto the side table.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,205
I sometimes do that, too, but it's
wobbly and dangerous up on a bed.

48
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,750
I wish you wouldn't do that!

49
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:13,253
Detective Satou's mattress is one of those
high-end types that's really soft.

50
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:17,342
How do you know what
Detective Satou's bed is like?

51
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,135
Have you slept in it?

52
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,512
No, uh...

53
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,890
I wanna have a sleepover
at your place, too!

54
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:30,272
Gossip fodder aside, how is
this place's owner doing?

55
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:35,152
Oh, he's out of surgery, but he's still
unconscious and in critical condition.

56
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,863
Once he comes around,
I'm sure he'll thank you.

57
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:43,577
You getting his door guard open
so quickly saved his life.

58
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,123
Actually, I think the first thing
he'll do is tell us something else.

59
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,085
He'll tell us who attacked him.

60
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,128
Wh-What do you mean,
attacked him?

61
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,588
This wasn't an accident?

62
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:00,427
Look, the chair is sitting right
on top of the comforter.

63
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,972
If you're going to put a chair on your
bed, wouldn't you pull that back first?

64
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:10,145
Plus, look at this. Mr. Masuko
still has one slipper on.

65
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:14,357
When you stand on a chair or a bed,
shouldn't you take your slippers off?

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,233
Good point...

67
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:21,072
Plus, I think that's the old fluorescent
bulb he took out to replace

68
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,323
that's lying shattered
on the floor there,

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,245
but there's no scorching at the ends.
It looks as good as new.

70
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:33,125
Which means that whoever shoved
Mr. Masuko here in the bedroom

71
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,503
and badly injured him

72
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,297
staged the room to make it
look like an accident.

73
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:43,720
It was apparently about an hour between
the time the neighbor heard the noise

74
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,305
and the building's super
coming up here,

75
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,850
so there was plenty of time
to set things up.

76
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:55,273
But they said there's only one
duplicate to the condo's door key,

77
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,693
and both keys are sitting on
the shelf in the living room.

78
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,113
Besides, how could he have
staged the door guard?

79
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,198
That little mystery's
already been solved!

80
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,283
Right, Conan?

81
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,828
You opened the door guard from outside,
so closing it should be easy.

82
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,915
Uh, I'm still working on that...

83
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,835
Hey, look!
Someone's on here!

84
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,253
You're right!

85
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:23,343
Hey, you kids!
Don't go around touching things!

86
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,095
It's a video intercom!

87
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,390
This intercom is set to record
anyone who buzzes up

88
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,060
at the entrance on
the first floor!

89
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,773
It recorded the people who were
here in the hour before us.

90
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:37,940
All three of them.

91
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:42,820
It recorded the audio, too,
and since they all say their names,

92
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,742
shouldn't you be able to find them by
checking those against his address book?

93
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:50,953
There's no time for you two
to have a quickie.

94
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,873
You and your big mouth, Takagi!

95
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,333
S-Sorry...

96
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,587
There's a beat-up pet carrier
and wrapping paper on the table.

97
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:04,342
So he really was planning to give
that calico to someone as a gift.

98
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,803
There's tape and creases
in the wrapping paper,

99
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,598
as well as signs of tears
here and there,

100
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,060
so had it already been wrapped,
and someone opened it?

101
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,522
I see tape and
a pair of scissors...

102
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,108
And the trash next to
the sofa is empty...

103
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,113
So why isn't it here?

104
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,033
It didn't take long
to find them.

105
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,410
These are the three people
on the video intercom.

106
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:37,542
Yes, but only the first person
was let into the victim's condo.

107
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,503
He spoke to the second visitor
at the door.

108
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:47,427
And the third said he rang the doorbell,
but there was no answer, so he left.

109
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,888
All three seem suspicious.

110
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:55,977
True. If the first visitor was still
here when the second one came,

111
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,023
the first visitor could still have
assaulted him after the second one left.

112
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,822
That reminds me, did Mr. Masuko answer
when you buzzed up from the entrance?

113
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:09,032
We didn't!

114
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:13,412
We were going to, but one of
the residents was leaving,

115
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:16,080
so we came in while
the door was open.

116
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,917
We wanted to come up
right away and surprise him!

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,293
He was expecting us.

118
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,547
He also told us his unit number.

119
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:25,548
I-I see...

120
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,843
Furuyo Tsuyuguchi (41)
Snack Bar Owner

121
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:34,807
Yes, I met with Mr. Masuko today.
We had tea in his living room.

122
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:39,937
I stayed for one record track, so I
suppose I was here about 10 minutes.

123
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:41,230
Record?

124
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:46,318
Yes. I collect vintage
jazz records.

125
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:51,282
Mr. Masuko said that he had found
an album that I've been looking for,

126
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:55,537
so I asked to listen to a track since
I had come all this way to pick it up.

127
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,582
Did the doorbell ring
while you were here?

128
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,918
I'm not sure,
I was wearing headphones.

129
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm sorry, do you mind
if I use the restroom?

130
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,758
-No, go ahead.
-I'll be right back.

131
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,970
Shoo! Shoo!

132
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:28,612
Damn it, kid! Why don't you turn off
the damn light when you're done?!

133
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,488
I'm sorry!

134
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:35,368
S-Sorry, that slipped out.
I can't stand wastefulness.

135
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,040
As I said earlier, I only spoke
to him at the door.

136
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,917
I never actually went inside.

137
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:43,627
Mari Asou (28)

138
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,337
He wasn't expecting me,
and it seemed like

139
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,547
he already had a visitor.

140
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,592
What did you want to talk
to Mr. Masuko about?

141
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,343
Well, you see...

142
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:58,558
I was fired from Mr. Masuko's company.
I wanted to see him one last time.

143
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,977
Wait, did you come here to give
him a piece of your mind?

144
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,357
No, the opposite! I was fired because
of a huge mistake on my part.

145
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:11,528
And Mr. Masuko was kind enough
to help me find a new job,

146
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,657
so I also wanted
to thank him.

147
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:18,537
What a cute kitty!
Can I hold him?

148
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:20,372
Sure!

149
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,582
He's so cute!

150
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,168
He's so happy he's
wagging his tail!

151
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,878
Oh, you're right!

152
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,755
Miss, you don't have
a cat of your own?

153
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:35,303
No, my parents hate animals.
I love them, though.

154
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,763
How many times do I
have to tell you?

155
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,600
Rinpei Urushiya (53)
Novelist

156
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,228
Yes, I came to the door, and I rang
this doorbell again and again

157
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,565
but he never answered,
so I gave up and left.

158
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,485
How did you get into
the building, then?

159
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,738
When I buzzed up from
the entrance, I was let in.

160
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:59,202
He didn't say anything, so I don't know
if he was the one who let me in, though.

161
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,080
How do you know Mr. Masuko?

162
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:05,458
We've known each other
since college.

163
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,462
We were novelists who
debuted the same year.

164
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:14,133
He gave it up pretty quickly because
his books didn't sell well, though.

165
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,053
That said, only my first
book sold well.

166
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:22,600
Looking back on it now, maybe he was
right to change careers when he did.

167
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,602
So, why you did you
come over?

168
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,563
To brainstorm ideas for
a new novel together.

169
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:31,902
He's always helped me whenever
I've had writer's block.

170
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,990
Take that cat away!
What a nuisance!

171
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,035
You don't like cats, mister?

172
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:44,288
No. I was even scratched by a
neighborhood stray this morning.

173
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,000
I have bandages
if you need one!

174
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:53,213
Don't worry.
I've already treated it.

175
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,965
Thanks.

176
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,968
Well, it would be
another story if this cat

177
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,972
were a master detective
like in those novels.

178
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:08,145
So, we know that the intercom
was buzzed by Ms. Tsuyuguchi,

179
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,858
Ms. Asou, and Mr. Urushiya,
in that order.

180
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:16,195
But the neighbor can't say for certain
when he heard the strange noise,

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,365
so we can't narrow it down
to one person.

182
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,993
I guess we have no choice but to wait
for Mr. Masuko to regain consciousness.

183
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,288
No, I don't think we'll
need to wait that long.

184
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,167
Look.

185
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:34,630
He's got his prankster's grin!

186
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:47,102
So, these three people came to visit
the victim at around the time

187
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:50,688
the neighbor heard
the strange noise?

188
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,065
-Yes, sir.
-But there's one problem.

189
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,487
The door was locked and
the door guard was shut, right?

190
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,822
Are you sure this is a crime?

191
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,323
Y-Yes, sir.

192
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:05,245
Conan says that the state of the scene
indicates that it was no accident.

193
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,498
This Conan boy is inside
the condo, then?

194
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:11,710
No, he said he had to buy something.

195
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,252
We're back!

196
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,172
Conan?

197
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,340
What did you go buy?

198
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,593
The thing that was missing
from Mr. Masuko's condo.

199
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,095
What thing?

200
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,055
This.

201
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,807
A wrapping ribbon!

202
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,978
After tying a ribbon, you usually trim
the ends to make them uniform.

203
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,232
So does the fact that there weren't
any ribbon trimmings in the trash

204
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,362
mean that he had taken out his scissors,
but had gotten the length just right?

205
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,158
It was an old, beat-up pet carrier that
had been wrapped, and there was tape,

206
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:48,162
so it was probably something that
Mr. Masuko wrapped himself, not a store.

207
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,083
What does all that mean, though?

208
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,670
Are you high? If it's missing
from the scene,

209
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,548
it obviously means that the culprit
used it for something!

210
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,550
A-Am I high?

211
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:06,055
To seal the room and make it look
like an accident, for instance.

212
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,558
Let's conduct an experiment!

213
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,895
Let's see if it's possible!

214
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,692
First, we'll try closing
the door guard!

215
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,155
Pass the ribbon through the open door
so it catches on the door guard.

216
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:26,075
Then go outside while gripping both ends
of the ribbon and close the door.

217
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,870
Now we just need to
pull on the ribbon.

218
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:32,582
-Okay, Mitsuhiko!
-Roger that!

219
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,043
-Pull!
-You got it!

220
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,465
I-It closed!

221
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:44,343
Now we'll try the door lock itself.

222
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:48,473
Open the door, and then, after making
sure the door guard is closed,

223
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:52,893
pull the ribbon out and tie
a knot right in the middle.

224
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,438
Knot tied!

225
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,902
Pass the ribbon through the gap under
the knob so that the knot catches there.

226
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:04,822
Now close the door with
one end of the ribbon outside.

227
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:07,908
Now, if you pull the ribbon
at an angle from the outside...

228
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,582
-That's amazing!
-He really locked it with the ribbon!

229
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,670
But unlike with the door guard, you
can't pull out the ribbon this time.

230
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,505
Hey! Pull as hard as you can.

231
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:23,048
I am!

232
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,803
The door is closed,
so the knot is stuck!

233
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,807
That's strange... I was sure
this would work.

234
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,810
Kids never think things through.

235
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,148
When you came in, there wasn't a ribbon
like this on the floor, right?

236
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:40,192
No.

237
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,608
There wasn't anything!

238
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:45,488
Then I guess that rules out this
ribbon method to lock the door.

239
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,990
Yeah, the ribbon would
be left behind.

240
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,995
It would work if someone pulled
out the ribbon from the inside

241
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,497
and hid it somewhere, though.

242
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,460
Like who? There wasn't anyone
inside but the victim!

243
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,503
And he still hasn't
regained consciousness.

244
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:02,713
I guess I have to spell it out.

245
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,427
Go on. It's right over there.

246
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:08,428
You can do it!

247
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,138
Keep wiggling the ribbon.

248
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:11,807
Sure!

249
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,818
The cat grabbed it in its mouth
and ran off with it!

250
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,070
Follow it!

251
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,072
Yes, sir!

252
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,118
He went behind that bookshelf?

253
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,080
This is the cat's treasure stash?

254
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,210
I found something!
The ribbon it just ran off with,

255
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,338
along with a different one!

256
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,050
It has a knot in it,
so this must be it.

257
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,175
Yes...

258
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,263
The question is, who used the
ribbon to do the door trick?

259
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:56,392
This had to be done by someone
intimately familiar with cats.

260
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,687
Yes. Enough to know

261
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,482
that this cat would not only
run off with the ribbon,

262
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,317
but also hide it somewhere.

263
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,112
Maybe it was the lady
with the glasses, then!

264
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,283
Captain wagged his tail
when he was held by her!

265
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:16,620
No. Unlike dogs, cats wag their
tails when they're irritated.

266
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:20,958
Miss Asou didn't know that, so wouldn't
that mean she's unfamiliar with cats?

267
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:25,838
Then maybe he was unhappy
because she had hurt his owner.

268
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,592
If that were true, she wouldn't
have asked to hold him.

269
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,762
She would have expected
to be scratched by him.

270
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:37,850
But that just leaves Miss Tsuyuguchi,
a power conservation nut,

271
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:43,398
and Mr. Urushiya, who picked up something
that fell out of Genta's pocket.

272
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:47,402
Those both seem like quirks.
Things they do without thinking.

273
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:48,612
Right.

274
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:55,285
But Genta dropped bandages,
a handkerchief and a bottle cap,

275
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,288
but Mr. Urushiya only
picked up the cap.

276
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,167
That's true, now that you
mention it. But why?

277
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,378
Let's find out.
Watch.

278
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:15,638
Oh, I see! This fella also has a thing
for bottle caps, doesn't he?

279
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:22,020
I see, he was afraid that if we saw
the cat run off with the bottle cap

280
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:26,148
and hide it in his stash, we might find
the ribbon he used for the door trick.

281
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,070
Well, it seems like a spur-of-the-moment
crime using items at the scene, so...

282
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:36,075
If he wasn't wearing gloves,
we can pull prints off of that ribbon.

283
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:40,080
Right, then! Let's question
Mr. Urushiya again!

284
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,875
Tell me, what made you
suspect the novelist?

285
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:49,505
Was it because Captain's tail
was raised around him?

286
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,590
Cats only do that
when they're happy

287
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:55,095
or when someone they're close to
is giving them attention.

288
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,430
Well, that's part of it.

289
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:00,017
When he said that someone
opened the door for him

290
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:03,268
when he buzzed up at the intercom
on the first floor,

291
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,855
that's when I had him
pegged as the culprit.

292
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:11,443
If it was the culprit who opened it,
it meant he was still in the condo.

293
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,742
If he still had to use that trick in the
foyer to create a locked room situation,

294
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:21,245
there's no way that he'd invite
someone to the front door.

295
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,042
You're right.

296
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,045
I was the one who badly
injured him by shoving him.

297
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:32,632
I must say, I'm amazed that you
improvised a trick like that.

298
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:36,010
I once wrote a mystery
where that was used.

299
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,847
You see, the reason I came today
was to ask him for money.

300
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,100
We were actually supposed
to meet tomorrow,

301
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:47,772
but he called this morning to say that
he had an amazing gift for me.

302
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:52,027
I couldn't bear to wait
and came today instead.

303
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:56,113
But what he gave me was
a battered pet carrier

304
00:19:56,197 --> 00:20:00,285
that he had clearly wrapped
at the last minute.

305
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,163
And what was inside
was that calico cat!

306
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:07,292
And to make it worse,
it was all a tease!

307
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,003
He said he couldn't
hand him over yet today!

308
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:14,173
Plus, he's just a stray, and I was the
one who found him in the first place!

309
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,218
He was your pet at first?

310
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:21,597
Yes, when he was a kitten.
Only for six months or so.

311
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:25,685
But his wife was grieving the loss of
her own pet, so I gave him to her.

312
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,688
Giving him up
was a smart move.

313
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:31,775
My book sales suddenly
dried up soon afterwards,

314
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:34,777
and I could barely feed myself,
much less a cat.

315
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,990
On the other hand, his business
was really taking off.

316
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:43,953
But in spite of that, he had the nerve
to foist that stupid stray onto me!

317
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:50,335
After the cat had run off with that ribbon
and hid it in the bedroom,

318
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,420
he picked it up and said,

319
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,922
As long as you have this cat,
it'll all work out.

320
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,262
He was yours originally anyway,
so he belongs with you.

321
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,558
But Captain's an amazing cat!

322
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,187
Boy calicos are rare!
They're hardly ever born!

323
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,480
They're worth lots of money!

324
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:18,947
I don't think Mr. Masuko tried to return
the cat to you because of his value.

325
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:24,243
Maybe it was because he's a maneki-neko,
a cat that brings good luck.

326
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,997
Isn't it great that Captain's
owner got out of the hospital?

327
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:53,625
Yeah! And none the
worse for wear!

328
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,168
So, what happened
with the cat?

329
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,505
I hear he ended up being
taken in by Azusa.

330
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,385
Huh? Captain?

331
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:06,930
No way! You didn't end up
on the streets again, did you?

332
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,057
Doesn't he look
a little smaller to you?

333
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,058
But the coat pattern
is the same... Hey, now!
Let's go home, Mugi!

334
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:20,652
Darn it, Grandma! You know you
shouldn't open her carrier!

335
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:23,738
I'm sorry! She seemed
so cooped up in there!

336
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,948
That's the old lady from before!
